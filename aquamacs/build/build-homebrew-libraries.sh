#
# This file is part of the Aquamacs build process. It finds any
# libraries that Aquamacs is using from Homebrew and copies them into
# the application bundle for distribution. It also updates the binary
# executable and libraries with appropriate path references.
#
# Aquamacs also needs these libraries to be built with the name
# minimum Mac OS version, so this script does that when needed.
#
# The primary use of this script is for the Aquamacs build machine,
# because it is really only relevant in building the Aquamacs binary
# distribution. It modifies Homebrew recipes. In almost all cases, the
# original recipes are restored after the script runs. This means that
# the relevant libraries will be rebuilt each time this script is run.

# For debugging, the environment variables can be used:
#   BUILD_HOMEBREW_DEBUG="-d"
# If this variable is defined, the -d option is passed to
# 'brew reinstall' to provide homebrew debugging information.
# In addition, if the variable is defined at all, this script
# does not remove the modified homebrew recipe files.

# Usage:
# sh build-homebrew-libraries.sh BUNDLE-DIR MIN-VERSION

# All of the main script action after the functions are defined.

# Add configuration for additional CFLAGS to a Homebrew formula
# Usage: add_cflags <formula-file>
