This file describes the process of building Aquamacs in various ways.

The Aquamacs git repository is at https://github.com/aquamacs-emacs/aquamacs-emacs.

Personal build
-----------

To build Aquamacs for personal use, to add a new feature, or fix a bug, it is usually sufficient to run

   ./build-aquamacs

in the top-level Aquamacs directory.

Development build
---------------

Nightly build
----------

The nightly build process (driven by aquamacs/build/nightly-build.sh) is used by the Aquamacs maintainer to make sure that the current git head builds correctly for distribution and to produce nightly test versions for anyone interested to try.

The process goes through the following steps:
1. Download the latest HEAD from the Aquamacs git repository
2. Build the Aquamacs documentation
3. Build the Aquamacs application bundle
4. Copy the necessary external libraries (notably gnutls and its dependencies) into
    the application bundle.
5. Create a compressed tar file (.tar.bz2) of the application bundle
6. Upload the compressed tar file to a web server

The nightly build is not signed.

If the process fails at any point, the build aborts.

For the normal build process in step 3, the nightly build uses the normal build-aquamacs script with the -release option, and it should not set any environment variables relevant to build-aquamacs.

The default directory for nightly builds is ~/Nightly (NIGHTLY_DIR). Changing this is not hard, but doing so has not been tested and there are possible bugs with that.

Logs of the build are kept in ${NIGHTLY_DIR}/logs. There are separate logs for documentation build and the application build.

The script has a few environment variables that can be overridden in some specific circumstances. See the script for details.

If you are working on the nightly-build script, see the script comments for details on how to keep your work from being overwritten by the git updates.

The upload script depends on both the local system configuration and the web server used to distribute the builds, so it is not part of the repository.
