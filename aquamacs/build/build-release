# Aquamacs Emacs -- release build script
#
# This script and build process are intended for internal use only, to
# build all of the parts of Aquamacs for release.
#
# TODO: It is currently derived from the nightly build script. To simplify
# the current work on updating it for full release builds, it doesn't have
# the full fetch from github & build in a clean directory functions, but
# these should be restored. Also, it does not include any code for posting.
# It may be possible to refactor these to share the common parts.
#
# RELEASE_DIR - specifies the directory to be used for the release build.
# BRANCH - controls the git branch used for the build. Defaults to aquamacs3.
# REPO - git repository to clone from if no repository is already present
# GIT=no - suppresses fetching of the main branch from github. This
#    is particularly useful when debugging this script.
# DOC_FAILED_EXIT=0 to continue building if the documentation build
#    fails. Normally it should not be overridden, but it is sometimes
#    necessary.
#
# If these variables are changed, the documentation in
# aquamacs/build/BUILD-AQUAMACS.txt should be updated as well.
