How to prepare an Aquamacs release


Checklist:


0. set version number in site-start.el and in doc/latex/changelog.tex.
1. cd aquamacs/build; ./make-documentation
2. add new files and commit what's in doc/AquamacsHelp and doc/latex directories.
3. either make build locally (using -release), for Intel, or make release build on server and download  
4. download builds, arrange in /Applications/Aquamacs Emacs.app.
5. cd build; ./make-release
This will extract version numbers and make a universal build (in /Applications/Aquamacs Emacs.app).  It will copy it to a DMG (named AquamacsInstall.dmg), which provides the shell.  This shell is not part of the GPL-licensed Aquamacs Emacs application and not included in git (for size reasons).
Verify the DMG, re-arrange icons.   Use Finder -> Info to hide .pdf extensions for the two PDF files.  Eject DMG.
Then execute hdiutil command as printed by make-release program.

6. Upload to distribution server (varies).

Website update:

Website is no longer in CVS.

7. Link on index.shtml  
8. download.shtml
9. run changelog update script (for release) - should be done on Braeburn. 
10. cgi-bin/currentversion.cgi
