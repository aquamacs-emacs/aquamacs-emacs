Topic branches:

topic/...
These features are intended to provide functionality that would work and make sense even in GNU Emacs, without the rest of Aquamacs.
They are maintained as topic branches.  All development should be done in a private branch.   Only when features are stable should they be checked into the topic branch.  Then, the topic branch is merged into the master branch:

git checkout master
git merge topic-branch
<resolve conflicts>
git commit

In case of conflicts, it is best to abandon the merge (git reset --hard), go back to the topic branch, update it to master and resolve all conflicts there:

git checkout topic-branch
git merge master
<resolve conflicts>
git commit

Initially, I have created the following topic branches (03/2009):

- face-remapping (window-background)

- tmm
- toolbar (toolbar-png)
- python-mode
- minibuffer  (former patches: recentf-track-minibuf, minibuffer-filename)
- reconf: (former patches: sentence-end, pretty-modeline)
- menu-bar (former patches: menu-bar)
- smart-spacing
- dialogs
- tabbar (header-line)
- mac-support (former patches: ns-launch-browser, mouse-emulate)

Changes to GNU Emacs code base without a topic branch:

Other patches from the old CVS patches.23/ directory can now be found 
in the master branch, without an extra topic, since they are too tiny to merit an extra branch:

- eval-depth
- fix-configure
- startup-load-preferences
- custom (former patches: cus-edit-switch, custom-verbosity)
- mouse-echo
- window-kill
