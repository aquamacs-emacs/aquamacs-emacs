A.3 Future Development
======================

The following sections describe future development of AUCTeX.  Besides
mid-term goals, bug reports and requests we cannot fix or honor right
away are being gathered here.  If you have some time for Emacs Lisp
hacking, you are encouraged to try to provide a solution to one of the
following problems.  If you don't know Lisp, you may help us to improve
the documentation.  It might be a good idea to discuss proposed changes
on the mailing list of AUCTeX first.

File: auctex.info,  Node: Mid-term Goals,  Next: Wishlist,  Up: Development

A.3.1 Mid-term Goals
--------------------

   * Integration of preview-latex into AUCTeX

     As of AUCTeX 11.81 preview-latex is a part of AUCTeX in the sense
     that the installation routines were merged and preview-latex is
     being packaged with AUCTeX.

     Further integration will happen at the backend.  This involves
     folding of error parsing and task management of both packages which
     will ease development efforts and avoid redundant work.

   * Error help catalogs

     Currently, the help for errors is more or less hardwired into
     'tex.el'.  For supporting error help in other languages, it would
     be sensible to instead arrange error messages in language-specific
     files, make a common info file from all such catalogs in a given
     language and look the error texts up in an appropriate index.  The
     user would then specify a preference list of languages, and the
     errors would be looked up in the catalogs in sequence until they
     were identified.

   * Combining 'docTeX' with RefTeX

     Macro cross references should also be usable for document
     navigation using RefTeX.

   * Fix remove-style feature

     Currently 'TeX-remove-style' implementation isn't good.  It is
     common practice that major mode functions directly add macros and
     environments via 'TeX-add-symbols' and 'LaTeX-add-environments',
     but those macros and environments are lost once 'TeX-remove-style'
     runs.  It is necessary to run major mode function, by e.g.
     'normal-mode', again to recover them, but that makes no point in
     running 'TeX-remove-style' itself because major mode function kills
     all buffer-local variables.

     As of AUCTeX 12.3, 'TeX-remove-style' is no longer used by any
     other codes.

A.3.2 Wishlist
--------------

   * Documentation lookup for macros

     A parser could gather information about which macros are defined in
     which LaTeX packages and store the information in a hashtable which
     can be used in a backend for 'TeX-doc' in order to open the
     matching documentation for a given macro.  The information could
     also be used to insert an appropriate '\usepackage' statement if
     the user tries to insert a macro for which the respective package
     has not been requested yet.

   * Improvements to error reporting

     Fringe indicators for errors in the main text would be nice.

   * A math entry grid

     A separate frame with a table of math character graphics to click
     on in order to insert the respective sequence into the buffer (cf.
     the "grid" of x-symbol).

   * Crossreferencing support

     It would be nice if you could index process your favorite
     collection of '.dtx' files (such as the LaTeX source), just call a
     command on arbitrary control sequence, and get either the DVI
     viewer opened right at the definition of that macro (using Source
     Specials), or the source code of the '.dtx' file.

   * Better plain TeX support

     For starters, 'LaTeX-math-mode' is not very LaTeX-specific in the
     first place, and similar holds for indentation and formatting.

   * Page count when compiling should (optionally) go to modeline of the
     window where the compilation command was invoked, instead of the
     output window.  Suggested by Karsten Tinnefeld
     <tinnefeld@irb.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>.

   * Command to insert a macrodefinition in the preamble, without moving
     point from the current location.  Suggested by "Jeffrey C. Ely"
     <ely@nwu.edu>.

   * A database of all commands defined in all stylefiles.  When a
     command or environment gets entered that is provided in one of the
     styles, insert the appropriate '\usepackage' in the preamble.

   * A way to add and overwrite math mode entries in style files, and to
     decide where they should be.  Suggested by Remo Badii
     <Remo.Badii@psi.ch>.

   * Create template for (first) line of tabular environment.

   * I think prompting for the master is the intended behaviour.  It
     corresponds to a 'shared' value for TeX-master.

     There should probably be a 'none' value which wouldn't query for
     the master, but instead disable all features that relies on
     TeX-master.

     This default value for TeX-master could then be controled with
     mapping based on the extension.

   * Use index files (when available) to speed up 'C-c C-m include
     <RET>'.

   * Option not to calculate very slow completions like for 'C-c C-m
     include <RET>'.

   * Font menu should be created from 'TeX-font-list'.

   * Installation procedure written purely in emacs lisp.

   * Included PostScript files should also be counted as part of the
     document.

   * A nice hierarchical by-topic organization of all officially
     documented LaTeX macros, available from the menu bar.

   * 'TeX-command-default' should be set from the master file, if not
     set locally.  Suggested by Peter Whaite '<peta@cim.mcgill.ca>'.

   * Make AUCTeX work with 'crypt++'.  Suggested by Chris Moore
     '<Chris.Moore@src.bae.co.uk>'.

   * Make AUCTeX work with 'longlines'.  This would also apply to
     preview-latex, though it might make sense to unify error processing
     before attempting this.

   * The 'Spell' command should apply to all files in a document.  Maybe
     it could try to restrict to files that have been modified since
     last spell check?  Suggested by Ravinder Bhumbla
     '<rbhumbla@ucsd.edu>'.

   * Make <.> check for abbreviations and sentences ending with capital
     letters.

   * Use Emacs 19 minibuffer history to choose between previewers, and
     other stuff.  Suggested by John Interrante
     '<interran@uluru.Stanford.EDU>'.

   * Documentation of variables that can be set in a style hook.

     We need a list of what can safely be done in an ordinary style
     hook.  You can not set a variable that AUCTeX depends on, unless
     AUCTeX knows that it has to run the style hooks first.

     Here is the start of such a list.

     'LaTeX-add-environments'

     'TeX-add-symbols'

     'LaTeX-add-labels'

     'LaTeX-add-bibliographies'

     'LaTeX-largest-level'

   * Outline should be (better) supported in TeX mode.

     At least, support headers, trailers, as well as TeX-outline-extra.

   * 'TeX-header-start' and 'TeX-trailer-end'.

     We might want these, just for fun (and outlines)

   * Plain TeX and LaTeX specific header and trailer expressions.

     We should have a way to globally specify the default value of the
     header and trailer regexps.

   * Get closer to original 'TeX-mode' keybindings.

     A third initialization file ('tex-mode.el') containing an emulator
     of the standard 'TeX-mode' would help convince some people to
     change to AUCTeX.

   * Use markers in 'TeX-error-list' to remember buffer positions in
     order to be more robust with regard to line numbers and changed
     files.

   * Finish the Texinfo mode.  For one thing, many Texinfo mode commands
     do not accept braces around their arguments.

   * Hook up the letter environment with 'bbdb.el'.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Bugs,  Prev: Wishlist,  Up: Development

A.3.3 Bugs
----------

   * The style hooks automatically generated by parsing files for
     'example.dtx', 'example.sty', 'example.drv' and 'example.bib' all
     clash.  Bad.  Clash with hand-written style hooks should be removed
     by dialect discrimination -- to be checked.

   * 'C-c `' should always stay in the current window, also when it
     finds a new file.

   * Do not overwrite emacs warnings about existing auto-save files when
     loading a new file.

   * Maybe the regexp for matching a TeX symbol during parsing should be
     '"\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\|.\\)"' --
     '<thiemann@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>' Peter Thiemann.

   * AUCTeX should not parse verbatim environments.

   * Make '`' check for math context in 'LaTeX-math-mode'.  and simply
     self insert if not in a math context.

   * Make 'TeX-insert-dollar' more robust.  Currently it can be fooled
     by '\mbox''es and escaped double dollar for example.

   * Correct indentation for tabular, tabbing, table, math, and array
     environments.

A.4 Frequently Asked Questions
==============================

  1. Something is not working correctly.  What should I do?

     Well, you might have guessed it, the first place to look is in the
     available documentation packaged with AUCTeX.  This could be the
     release notes (in the 'RELEASE' file) or the news section of the
     manual in case you are experiencing problems after an upgrade, the
     'INSTALL' file in case you are having problems with the
     installation, the section about bugs in the manual in case you
     encountered a bug or the relevant sections in the manual for other
     related problems.

     If this did not help, you can send a bug report to the AUCTeX bug
     reporting list by using the command 'M-x TeX-submit-bug-report
     RET'.  But before you do this, you can try to get more information
     about the problem at hand which might also help you locate the
     cause of the error yourself.

     First, you can try to generate a so-called backtrace which shows
     the functions involved in a program error.  In order to do this,
     start Emacs with the command line 'emacs --debug-init' and/or put
     the line

          (setq debug-on-error t)

     as the first line into your init file.  After Emacs has started,
     you can load a file which triggers the error and a new window
     should pop up showing the backtrace.  If you get such a backtrace,
     please include it in the bug report.

     Second, you can try to figure out if something in your personal or
     site configuration triggers the error by starting Emacs without
     such customizations.  You can do this by invoking Emacs with the
     command line 'emacs -q -no-site-file -l auctex'.  The '-l' option
     'auctex.el' which you normally do in your init file.  After you
     have started Emacs like this, you can load the file triggering the
     error.  If everything is working now, you know that you have to
     search either in the site configuration file or your personal init
     file for statements related to the problem.

  2. What versions of Emacs are supported?

     AUCTeX was tested with GNU Emacs 24.  Older versions may work but
     are unsupported.

  3. What should I do when './configure' does not find programs like
     latex?

     This is problem often encountered on Windows.  Make sure that the
     'PATH' environment variable includes the directories containing the
     relevant programs, as described in *note (auctex)Installation under
     MS Windows::.

  4. Why doesn't the completion, style file, or multi-file stuff work?

     It must be enabled first, insert this in your init file:

          (setq-default TeX-master nil)
          (setq TeX-parse-self t)
          (setq TeX-auto-save t)

     Read also the chapters about parsing and multifile documents in the
     manual.

  5. Why doesn't 'TeX-save-document' work?

     'TeX-check-path' has to contain "./" somewhere.

  6. Why is the information in 'foo.tex' forgotten when I save
     'foo.bib'?

     For various reasons, AUCTeX ignores the extension when it stores
     information about a file, so you should use unique base names for
     your files.  E.g.  rename 'foo.bib' to 'foob.bib'.

  7. Why doesn't AUCTeX signal when processing a document is done?

     If the message in the minibuffer stays "Type 'C-c C-l' to display
     results of compilation.", you probably have a misconfiguration in
     your init file ('.emacs', 'init.el' or similar).  To track this
     down either search in the '*Messages*' buffer for an error message
     or put '(setq debug-on-error t)' as the first line into your init
     file, restart Emacs and open a LaTeX file.  Emacs will complain
     loudly by opening a debugging buffer as soon as an error occurs.
     The information in the debugging buffer can help you find the cause
     of the error in your init file.

  8. Why does 'TeX-next-error' ('C-c `') fail?

     If 'TeX-file-line-error' is set to nil (not the default), these
     sort of failures might be related to the the fact that when writing
     the log file, TeX puts information related to a file, including
     error messages, between a pair of parentheses.  In this scenario
     AUCTeX determines the file where the error happened by parsing the
     log file and counting the parentheses.  This can fail when there
     are other, unbalanced parentheses present.

     Activating so-called file:line:error messages for the log file
     usually solves this issue, as these kind of messages are are easier
     to parse; however, they may lack some details.  Activation can be
     done either in the configuration of your TeX system (consult its
     manual to see where this is) or by simply keeping the variable
     'TeX-file-line-error' to the default value of non-nil.

  9. What does AUC stand for?

     AUCTeX came into being at Aalborg University in Denmark.  Back then
     the Danish name of the university was Aalborg Universitetscenter;
     AUC for short.

A.5 Features specific to AUCTeX's Texinfo major mode
====================================================

AUCTeX includes a major mode for editting Texinfo files.  This major
mode is not the same mode as the native Texinfo mode (*note (texinfo)
Texinfo Mode::) of Emacs, although they have the same name.  However,
AUCTeX still relies on a number of functions from the native Texinfo
mode.

   The following text describes which functionality is offered by AUCTeX
and which by the native Texinfo mode.  This should enable you to decide
when to consult the AUCTeX manual and when the manual of the native
mode.  And in case you are a seasoned user of the native mode, the
information should help you to swiftly get to know the AUCTeX-specific
commands.

A.5.1 How AUCTeX and the native mode work together
--------------------------------------------------

In a nutshell the split between AUCTeX Texinfo mode, and native Texinfo
mode is as follows:

   * Most of the editing (environment creation, commenting, font command
     insertions) and/or processing commands (e.g.  compiling or
     printing) which are available in other AUCTeX modes are also
     handled by AUCTeX in Texinfo mode.

   * Texinfo-related features (e.g.  info node linkage or menu creation)
     rely on the commands provided by the native Texinfo mode.  AUCTeX
     provides the key bindings to reach these functions, keeping the
     same keys as in native Texinfo whenever possible, or similar ones
     otherwise.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Superseding,  Next: Mapping,  Prev: Exploiting,  Up: Texinfo mode

A.5.2 Where the native mode is superseded
-----------------------------------------

This section is directed to users of the native Texinfo mode switching
to AUCTeX.  It follows the summary of the native mode (*note (texinfo)
Texinfo Mode Summary::) and lists which of its commands are no longer of
use.

Insert commands
     In the native Texinfo mode, frequently used Texinfo commands can be
     inserted with key bindings of the form 'C-c C-c K' where K differs
     for each Texinfo command; 'c' inserts @code, 'd' inserts @dfn, 'k'
     @kbd, etc.

     In AUCTeX commands are inserted with the key binding 'C-c C-m'
     instead which prompts for the macro to be inserted.  For font
     selection commands (like @b, @i, or @emph) and a few related ones
     (like @var, @key or @code) there are bindings which insert the
     respective macros directly.  They have the form 'C-c C-f K' or 'C-c
     C-f C-K' and call the function 'TeX-font'.  Type 'C-c C-f <RET>' to
     get a list of supported commands.

     Note that the prefix argument is not handled the same way by
     AUCTeX.  Note also that the node insertion command from the native
     mode ('texinfo-insert-@node') can still accessed from the Texinfo
     menu in AUCTeX.

Insert braces
     In AUCTeX braces can be inserted with the same key binding as in
     the native Texinfo mode: 'C-c {'.  But AUCTeX uses its own function
     for the feature: 'TeX-insert-braces'.

Insert environments
     The native Texinfo mode does not insert full environments.
     Instead, it provides the function 'texinfo-insert-@end' (mapped to
     'C-c C-c e') for closing an open environment with a matching @end
     statement.

     In AUCTeX you can insert full environments, i.e.  both the opening
     and closing statements, with the function 'Texinfo-environment'
     (mapped to 'C-c C-e').

Format info files with makeinfo and TeX
     In the native Texinfo mode there are various functions and bindings
     to format a region or the whole buffer for info or to typeset the
     respective text.  For example, there is 'makeinfo-buffer' (mapped
     to 'C-c C-m C-b') which runs 'makeinfo' on the buffer or there is
     'texinfo-tex-buffer' (mapped to 'C-c C-t C-b') which runs TeX on
     the buffer in order to produce a DVI file.

     In AUCTeX different commands for formatting or typesetting can be
     invoked through the function 'TeX-command-master' (mapped to 'C-c
     C-c').  After typing 'C-c C-c', you can select the desired command,
     e.g 'Makeinfo' or 'TeX', through a prompt in the mini buffer.  Note
     that you can make, say 'Makeinfo', the default by adding this
     statement in your init file:

          (add-hook 'Texinfo-mode-hook
                    (lambda () (setq TeX-command-default "Makeinfo")))

     Note also that 'C-c C-c Makeinfo <RET>' is not completely
     functionally equivalent to 'makeinfo-buffer' as the latter will
     display the resulting info file in Emacs, showing the node
     corresponding to the position in the source file, just after a
     successful compilation.  This is why, while using AUCTeX, invoking
     'makeinfo-buffer' might still be more convenient.

     Note also that in the case of a multifile document, 'C-c C-c' in
     AUCTeX will work on the whole document (provided that the file
     variable 'TeX-master' is set correctly), while 'makeinfo-buffer' in
     the native mode will process only the current buffer, provided at
     the '@setfilename' statement is provided.

Produce indexes and print
     The native Texinfo mode provides the binding 'C-c C-t C-i'
     ('texinfo-texindex') for producing an index and the bindings 'C-c
     C-t C-p' ('texinfo-tex-print') and 'C-c C-t C-q'
     ('tex-show-print-queue') for printing and showing the printer
     queue.  These are superseded by the respective commands available
     through 'C-c C-c' ('TeX-command-master') in AUCTeX: Index, Print,
     and Queue.

Kill jobs
     The command 'C-c C-t C-k' ('tex-kill-job') in the native mode is
     superseded by 'C-c C-k' ('TeX-kill-job') in AUCTeX.

A.5.3 Where key bindings are mapped to the native mode
------------------------------------------------------

This node follows the native Texinfo mode summary (*note (texinfo)
Texinfo Mode Summary::) and lists only those commands to which AUCTeX
provides a keybinding.

   Basically all commands of the native mode related to producing menus
and interlinking nodes are mapped to same or similar keys in AUCTeX,
while a few insertion commands are mapped to AUCTeX-like keys.

'@item' insertion
     The binding 'C-c C-c i' for the insertion of '@item' in the native
     mode is mapped to 'M-<RET>' or 'C-c C-j' in AUCTeX, similar to
     other AUCTeX modes.

'@end' insertion
     The binding 'C-c C-c e' for closing a '@FOO' command by a
     corresponding '@end FOO' statement in the native mode is mapped to
     'C-c C-]' in AUCTeX, similar to other AUCTeX modes.

Move out of balanced braces
     The binding 'C-}' ('up-list') is available both in the native mode
     and in AUCTeX.  (This is because the command is not implemented in
     either mode but a native Emacs command.)  However, in AUCTeX, you
     cannot use 'C-]' for this, as it is used for '@end' insertion.

Update pointers
     The bindings 'C-c C-u C-n' ('texinfo-update-node') and 'C-c C-u
     C-e' ('texinfo-every-node-update') from the native mode are
     available in AUCTeX as well.

Update menus
     The bindings 'C-c C-u m' ('texinfo-master-menu'), 'C-c C-u C-m'
     ('texinfo-make-menu'), and 'C-c C-u C-a'
     ('texinfo-all-menus-update') from the native mode are available in
     AUCTeX as well.  The command 'texinfo-start-menu-description',
     bound to 'C-c C-c C-d' in the native mode, is bound to 'C-c C-u
     C-d' in AUCTeX instead.

A.5.4 Which native mode key bindings are missing
------------------------------------------------

The following commands from the native commands might still be useful
when working with AUCTeX, however, they are not accessible with a key
binding any longer.

'@node' insertion
     The node insertion command, mapped to 'C-c C-c n' in the native
     mode, is not mapped to any key in AUCTeX.  You can still access it
     through the Texinfo menu, though.  Another alternative is to use
     the 'C-c C-m' binding for macro insertion in AUCTeX.

Show the section structure
     The command 'texinfo-show-structure' ('C-c C-s') from the native
     mode does not have a key binding in AUCTeX.  The binding is used by
     AUCTeX for sectioning.
