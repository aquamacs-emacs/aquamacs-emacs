This file describes the installation of Elib, the GNU emacs lisp
library.  You should install not only the library but also the on-line
documentation so that your users will know how to use it.  You can
also create written documentation from the file elib.texi as well
as an on-line info file.


I. Installation

 1) Edit the Makefile to reflect the situation at your site. The only
    things you will have to change at this stage is the definition of
    locallisppath and infodir.  In the locallisppath directory, a
    subdirectory with the name `elib' will be created.  All elisp
    files of the library will be copied there when you do the actual
    installation (see step 2. below).

    We suggest you use the directory which is intended for this in the
    emacs distribution (usually /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp or
    something similar) for this. 

 2) Type `make install' in the source directory. This will
    byte-compile all .el-files of the library and create the
    subdirectory `elib' in the directory you specified in step 1.
    It will also copy both the .el and the .elc files of the library
    there.

    If you only want to create the compiled elisp files, but don't
    want to install them,  you can type `make' instead. 

 3) Edit the file `default.el' in your emacs lisp directory (usually
    /usr/gnu/emacs/lisp or something similar) and enter the contents
    of the file `elib-startup.el' into it.  This file was created from
    the file `startup_template.el' by the make in step 2. 


II. Installation of the on-line manual.

 1) Create the info file `elib.info' from elib.texi.  This is done if
    you use `make' or `make install'.

 2) Move the info file `elib.info' to your standard info directory.
    Usually this is /usr/local/share/info or something similar. See
    step I.3 above.

 3) Edit the file `dir' in the info directory and enter one line
    containing a pointer to the info file elib.  The line can, for
    instance, look like this:

    * Elib: (elib.info).	The Emacs Lisp Library.


III. How to make written documentation from elib.texi

You can also make a typeset manual from the file elib.texi.  Just
follow these steps:

 1) If the file texinfo.tex is not properly installed in the path
    given by the environment variable $TEXINPUTS, get it and put it in
    the same directory as elib.texi.  This file contains macros
    used by the TeX formatting program to produce typeset output from
    a texinfo file. You can get this for instance from from
    prep.ai.mit.edu in the US or from ftp.isy.liu.se in Europe.

 2) Run TeX by typing `tex elib.texi'.  You might need to do this
    twice to get correct cross references.

 3) Convert the resulting device independent file `elib.dvi' to a form
    which your printer can output and print it.  If you have
    postscript printers there is a program, dvi2ps, which can do this.
    There is also a program which comes with TeX, dvips, which you can
    use.
