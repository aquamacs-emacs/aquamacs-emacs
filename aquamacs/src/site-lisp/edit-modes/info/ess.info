     Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) provides an intelligent, consistent
     interface between the user and the software.  ESS interfaces with
     SAS, S-PLUS, R, BUGS/JAGS and other statistical analysis packages
     on Unix, Linux and Microsoft Windows.  ESS is itself a package
     within the emacs text editor and uses emacs features to streamline
     the creation and use of statistical software.  ESS knows the syntax
     and grammar of statistical analysis packages and provides
     consistent display and editing features based on that knowledge.
     ESS assists in interactive and batch execution of statements
     written in these statistical analysis languages.

1 Introduction to ESS
*********************

The S family (S, Splus and R) and SAS statistical analysis packages
provide sophisticated statistical and graphical routines for
manipulating data.  Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) is based on the merger
of two pre-cursors, S-mode and SAS-mode, which provided support for the
S family and SAS respectively.  Later on, Stata-mode was also
incorporated.

   ESS provides a common, generic, and useful interface, through emacs,
to many statistical packages.  It currently supports the S family, SAS,
BUGS/JAGS, and Stata with the level of support roughly in that order.

   A bit of notation before we begin.  _emacs_ refers to both _GNU
Emacs_ by the Free Software Foundation, as well as _XEmacs_ by the
XEmacs Project.  The emacs major mode 'ESS[language]', where 'language'
can take values such as 'S', 'SAS', or 'XLS'.  The inferior process
interface (the connection between emacs and the running process)
referred to as inferior ESS ('iESS'), is denoted in the modeline by
'ESS[dialect]', where 'dialect' can take values such as 'S3', 'S4',
'S+3', 'S+4', 'S+5', 'S+6', 'S+7', 'R', 'XLS', 'VST', 'SAS'.

   Currently, the documentation contains many references to ''S'' where
actually any supported (statistics) language is meant, i.e., 'S' could
also mean 'R' or 'SAS'.

   For exclusively interactive users of S, ESS provides a number of
features to make life easier.  There is an easy to use command history
mechanism, including a quick prefix-search history.  To reduce typing,
command-line completion is provided for all S objects and "hot keys" are
provided for common S function calls.  Help files are easily accessible,
and a paging mechanism is provided to view them.  Finally, an incidental
(but very useful) side-effect of ESS is that a transcript of your
session is kept for later saving or editing.

   No special knowledge of Emacs is necessary when using S interactively
under ESS.

   For those that use S in the typical edit-test-revise cycle when
programming S functions, ESS provides for editing of S functions in
Emacs edit buffers.  Unlike the typical use of S where the editor is
restarted every time an object is edited, ESS uses the current Emacs
session for editing.  In practical terms, this means that you can edit
more than one function at once, and that the ESS process is still
available for use while editing.  Error checking is performed on
functions loaded back into S, and a mechanism to jump directly to the
error is provided.  ESS also provides for maintaining text versions of
your S functions in specified source directories.

1.1 Why should I use ESS?
=========================

Statistical packages are powerful software systems for manipulating and
analyzing data, but their user interfaces often leave something
something to be desired: they offer weak editor functionality and they
differ among themselves so markedly that you have to re-learn how to do
those things for each package.  ESS is a package which is designed to
make editing and interacting with statistical packages more uniform,
user-friendly and give you the power of emacs as well.

   ESS provides several features which make it easier to interact with
the ESS process (a connection between your buffer and the statistical
package which is waiting for you to input commands).  These include:

   * Command-line editing for fixing mistakes in commands before they
     are entered.  The '-e' flag for S-plus provides something similar
     to this, but here you have the full range of Emacs commands rather
     than a limited subset.  However, other packages do not necessarily
     have features like this built-in.  *Note Command-line editing::.

   * Searchable command history for recalling previously-submitted
     commands.  This provides all the features of the 'Splus -e' history
     mechanism, plus added features such as history searching.  *Note
     Command History::.

   * Command-line completion of both object and file names for quick
     entry.  This is similar to 'tcsh''s facility for filenames; here it
     also applies to object names and list components.  *Note
     Completion::.

   * Hot-keys for quick entry of commonly-used commands in 'S' such as
     'objects()' and 'search()'.  *Note Hot keys::.

   * Transcript recording for a complete record of all the actions in an
     S session.  *Note Transcript::.

   * Interface to the help system, with a specialized mode for viewing S
     help files.  *Note Help::.

   If you commonly create or modify S functions, you will have found the
standard facilities for this (the 'fix()' function, for example)
severely limiting.  Using S's standard features, one can only edit one
function at a time, and you can't continue to use S while editing.  ESS
corrects these problems by introducing the following features:

   * Object editing.  ESS allows you to edit more than one function
     simultaneously in dedicated Emacs buffers.  The ESS process may
     continue to be used while functions are being edited.  *Note Edit
     buffer::.

   * A specialized editing mode for S code, which provides syntactic
     indentation and highlighting.  *Note Indenting::.

   * Facilities for loading and error-checking source files, including a
     keystroke to jump straight to the position of an error in a source
     file.  *Note Error Checking::.

   * Source code revision maintenance, which allows you to keep historic
     versions of S source files.  *Note Source Files::.

   * Facilities for evaluating S code such as portions of source files,
     or line-by-line evaluation of files (useful for debugging).  *Note
     Evaluating code::.

   Finally, ESS provides features for re-submitting commands from saved
transcript files, including:

   * Evaluation of previously entered commands, stripping away
     unnecessary prompts.  *Note Transcript resubmit::.

1.2 New features in ESS
=======================

Changes / Selected Bug Fixes in 13.09-1:
   * ess-remote and TRAMP: R support code is now downloaded in binary
     form instead of being injected from local machine.  The R code is
     stored in '~/.config/ESSR/' directory on the remote machine
   * TRAMP: PAGER environment variable is now correctly set to
     'inferior-ess-pager'
   * retrieval of help topics on remote machines is fixed
   * org-babel: source references of R code executed from org files
     correctly point to source references in original org files (version
     8.2.1 or higher of org-mode is required for this feature)
   * 'ess-execute' is now bound to 'C-c C-e C-e' in 'ess-extra-map'.
   * completion works again in 'ess-execute'
   * ESS[R]: 'head' and 'tail' methods were replaced by 'htsummary' in
     'ess-R-describe-object-at-point-commands'
   * ESS[roxygen]: evaluation commands now work in roxygen blocks.
     Leading comments are automatically removed before the evaluation
   * ESS[transcript]: 'Clean Region' now works with multiline
     statements; 'ess-transcript-clean-region' etc.  correctly treat
     multiline statements, i.e., no longer forgets the lines typically
     preceded by '+'
   * ESS[SAS]: Three features/fixes with special thanks to Matthew
     Fidler https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/pulls/mlf176f2
     (https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/pulls/mlf176f2).  Turn on SAS log
     mode when appropriate.  Indent comments and CARDS statement more
     appropriately.
   * ESS[SAS]: 'ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle' default returns to 'nil'
   * ESS[R]: support for 'prettify-symbols-mode': contribution from
     Rudiger Sonderfeld <https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/pull/65>
   * ESS[SWV]: knitr now evaluates in the current frame
   * ESS[developer]: ess-developer doesn't kill open DESCRIPTION files
     anymore
   * ESS[roxygen]: 'ess-roxy-preview-HTML' is now on 'C-c C-o C-w' and
     'ess-roxy-preview-text' is now on 'C-c C-o C-t'
   * ESS: installation with 'make install' was simplified and should
     work out of the box on most *nix systems
   * ESS installation instructions simplified
   * fixed font-lock bug introduced in 13.09 that was causing very slow
     process output

   Changes/New Features in 13.09:
   * font-lock in process buffers doesn't "spill" over prompts.  Missing
     closing string delimiters should not cause wrong fontification of
     the following command input.
   * ESS[julia]: full features M-TAB completion and auto-complete
     support, which now works for modules, structures and data types.
   * ESS[julia]: a much better eldoc showing arguments of methods and
     data type constructors
   * ESS-developer:
        - ESS-developer work-flow pattern has been streamlined:
          ESS-developer is now automatically activated on per-file basis
          if the file is part of a developed package
          'ess-developer-packages'.  The old behavior (activation on
          per-process basis) is still available on 'M-x ess-developer'
          in a process buffer.
        - integration with 'devtools' package.  New command
          'ess-developer-load-package' calls 'load_all' on the package
          containing current file.  'ess-developer-add-package' now
          offers IDO menu completions with available loading methods,
          currently 'library', and 'load_all'.  Loading command can be
          customized with 'ess-developer-load-on-add-commands'.
   * 'TAB' now indents region if region is active (a contribution of
     Matthew Fidler in pull #41)
   * 'M-x ess-version' now reports full loading path and recognizes git
     and ELPA versions.
   * warning and error keyword are now highlighted with
     'font-lock-warning-face' as they should be, (for quite some time
     these keywords have been hijacked by compilation mode
     fontification).
   * eldoc: Eldoc now recognizes multiple processes.  If current process
     is busy, or current buffer is not associated with a process, eldoc
     picks its completions from the first available free process.
   * org-babel: evaluation is now org-friendly
   * help: new help buffers now try to reuse ess-help buffers.  This
     behavior is controlled by 'ess-help-reuse-window' custom variable.
   * help: ?foo pops IDO menu on multiple help files (so far it worked
     only for 'C-c C-v')
   * remote evaluation is considerably faster now on slow connections
   * ESS[R] tracebug R source references regular expressions are
     (mostly) language agnostic.
   * 'ess-function-call-face' inherits from
     'font-lock-function-name-face' rather than
     'font-lock-builtin-face'.
   * 'ess-inject-source' now accepts 'function-and-buffer' option.
   * Documentation: The "New Features" section (and 'NEWS') now
     represent recent changes: within the last year or so.  All changes
     can be found in the new news.html (news.html) (or 'NEWS' and
     'ONEWS').
   * ESS[R] 'ess-rep-regexp' should no longer inf.loop (rarely!), and
     hence 'M-x ess-fix-miscellaneous' should neither.

   Changes/New Features in 13.05:
   * ESS[gretl]: Support for 'gretl' (both editing and sub-process
     interaction).  A contribution of Ahmadou Dicko.
   * ESS: process output display is 4-10 times faster due to new caching
     and only occasional emacs re-display (for the moment this
     functionality is available only when 'ess-tracebug' is active).
   * ESS: 'C-c `' is now bound to 'ess-show-traceback' and 'C-c ~' is
     bound to 'ess-show-call-stack'.
   * ESS[R]: ESS stores function in 'ESSR' environment to avoid kludging
     users' global environment and accidental deletion.
   * ESS[R]: new variable 'ess-swv-processing-command' to control
     weaving and tangling.
   * ESS[R]: 'ess-default-style' has been changed (from 'DEFAULT') to
     'RRR'.  Use something like '(setq ess-default-style 'DEFAULT)' or
     '(setq ess-indent-level 2)' in your '~/.emacs' equivalent _before_
     loading ESS, if you do not like this new "incompatible" default
     style.
   * ESS[julia]: ESS stores its functions in 'ESS' module.
   * ESS[julia]: Eldoc is now supported in julia modes
   * ESS[julia]: Adjusted error reference detection and interactive help
     to julia internal changes
   * ESS[R]: 'ess-use-tracebug''s default has been changed to 't'.  Set
     it to nil if you want to keep the previous behavior.
   * ESS[tracebug]: Electric debug keys have been removed [breaking
     change] The functionality was replaced with 'ess-debug-minor-mode'
     and 'ess-debug-minor-mode-map'.
   * ESS[tracebug]: 'ess-tracebug-map' is an alias to 'ess-dev-map' 'C-c
     C-t'.
   * ESS[tracebug]: 'ess-bp-toggle-state' ('C-c C-t o') can now be used
     during the debug session to toggle breakpoints on the fly
     (suggestion by Ross Boylan).
   * ESS[tracebug]: 'ess-debug-flag-for-debugging' and
     'ess-debug-unflag-for-debugging' work correctly from the debugging
     contexts.  These commands also recognize non-exported functions for
     the packages listed in 'ess-developer-packages' ('C-c C-t C-a').

   * ESS[R]: Eldoc (activated by 'ess-use-eldoc') has become more
     sophisticated, and hence also more intruding in the interface
     between the Statistics softare, e.g., R, and the user.

     Note that you can turn off ElDoc, by placing '(setq ess-use-eldoc
     nil)' in your '~/.emacs' file, prior to loading ESS,

   * ESS[SAS]: long over-looked 'SAS-mode-hook' appears!
   * ESS[SAS]: 'ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle' now defaults to 't' since
     'sas-indent-line' is still broken, i.e.  'TAB' is now bound to
     'ess-sas-tab-to-tab-stop' by default

   Changes/Bug Fixes in 12.09-2:
   * ESS: new 'ess-switch-to-end-of-proc-buffer' variable that controls
     whether 'C-c C-z' switches to the end of process buffer.  The
     default is 't'.  You can use prefix argument to 'C-c C-z' to toggle
     this variable.
   * ESS: fix in 'ess-eval-linewise' that was causing emacs to hang
     during R debugging with 'ess-eval-visibly' equal to 't'.
   * ESS: fix in 'ess-eval-linewise' that was causing emacs to recenter
     the prompt in visible window
   * ESS[tracebug]: A better handling of "Selection" prompts and debug
     related singlekey commands.
   * ESS: fix a bug in 'ess-switch-process' that was causing '*new*'
     selection to fail.
   * ESS[R]: Solve missing 'ess-local-process-name' bug in R-dired.
   * ESS[SWV]: 'ess-swv-PDF' doesn't ask for a command to run if there
     is only one command in 'ess-swv-pdflatex-commands'.
   * ESS[SWV]: 'ess-swv-weave' gained an universal argument to allow for
     an interactive choice between available weavers (sweave, knitr).
   * ESS: 'ess-eval-*-and-step' functions go to next empty line at eob,
     instead of staying at the last line.

   Changes/New Features in 12.09-1:
   * ESS _Breaking Changes in Keys_:

        - New keymaps: 'ess-doc-map' bound to 'C-c C-d'; 'ess-extra-map'
          bound to 'C-c C-e'; 'ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer' was
          moved on 'C-c C-e C-d'
        - roxygen map was moved on 'C-c C-o' and 'ess-roxy-update-entry'
          now resides on 'C-c C-o C-o'
        - ess-handy-commands is not bound anymore
        - 'ess-dev-map' (including 'ess-tracebug' and 'ess-developer')
          moved on 'C-c C-t'
        - 'C-c C-y' is deprecated in favor of 'C-c C-z C-z'
   * ESS[R] new command 'ess-describe-object-at-point' bound to 'C-c C-d
     C-e' (repeat 'C-e' or 'e' to cycle).  It was inspired by Erik
     Iverson's 'ess-R-object-tooltip'.  Customize
     'ess-describe-at-point-method' to use tooltip instead of an
     electric buffer.
   * ESS: New command 'ess-build-tags-for-directory' bound to 'C-c C-e
     C-t' for building dialect specific tag tables.  After building tags
     use 'M-.' to navigate to function and objects definitions.  By
     default 'C-c C-e C-t' builds tags based on imenu regular
     expressions and also include other common languages '.c, .o, .cpp'
     etc.  But it relies on external 'find' and 'etags' commands.  If
     'ess-build-tags-command' is defined (for 'R'), the inferior process
     is asked to build tags instead.
   * ESS: 'ess-switch-process' offers '*new*' alternative to start a new
     process instead of switching to one of the currently running
     processes.
   * ESS: Switching between processes ('C-c C-s') uses buffer names
     instead of the internal process names.  Use 'M-x rename-buffer'
     command to conveniently rename your process buffers.
   * ESS: Process buffers can be automatically named on process creation
     according to user specified scheme.  Default schemes are *proc*,
     *proc:dir* and *proc:abbr-long-dir* where 'proc' stands for the
     internal process name and 'dir' stands for the directory where the
     process was started in.  The default is *proc*.  For customization
     see 'ess-gen-proc-buffer-name-function'.
   * ESS: 'ess-eval-visibly-p' is deprecated in favor of
     'ess-eval-visibly'.
   * ESS: New evaluation pattern 'nowait'.  In addition to old 'nil' and
     't' values, 'ess-eval-visibly' accepts 'nowait' for a visible
     evaluation with no waiting for the process.  See 'ess-eval-visibly'
     for details on evaluation patterns.
   * ESS: New "Process" menu entry with process related commands and
     configuration
   * iESS: Process buffer is now automatically shown on errors
   * ESS: New 'ess-switch-to-inferior-or-script-buffer' command bound to
     'C-c C-z' in both script and process buffers.  If invoked form
     process buffer it switches to the most recent buffer of the same
     dialect.  It is a single key command.
   * ESSR-help: On multiple help pages with the same name, 'C-c C-v' now
     asks for user resolution directly in emacs.
   * ESS[R] ess-roxy: new variable 'ess-roxy-re' for fontification of
     cases where the number of leading '#' differs from 'ess-roxy-str'.
   * ESS[R] Eldoc was considerably enhanced.  It now finds hidden
     default S3 methods and displays non-default methods' arguments
     after trailing ||.
   * ESS[R]: New 'ess-display-demos' command bound to 'C-c C-d o' and
     'C-c C-d C-o'
   * ESS: New 'ess-help-web-search' command bound to 'C-c C-d w' and
     'C-c C-d C-w' to facilitate interactive search of web resources.
     Implemented for 'R', 'Stata' and 'Julia'.  See also
     'ess-help-web-search-command'.
   * ESS: ess-pdf-viewer-pref accepts now command line arguments
   * ESS[Rnw]: Add knitr support.  Customize 'ess-swv-processor' for the
     default processor.
   * ESS[Rnw]: More thorough renaming of remaining 'noweb-*' to
     'ess-noweb-*'.
   * ESS[Rnw] new commands 'ess-eval-chunk-and-step' and
     'ess-eval-chunk' bound to 'M-n C-c' and 'M-n C-M-x' to mirror
     standard ess commands in C-c map.
   * ESS[R] Auto-completion: new variable 'ess-ac-R-argument-suffix' to
     customize the insertion of trailing "=".  Defaults to " = ".
   * ESS[Julia]: Added index, apropos and web-search to julia.
   * ESS help: More evaluation commands were added to ess-help mode
     ('C-c C-c', 'C-M-x' etc)

   Bug Fixes in 12.09-1:
   * iESShelp: Multiple help pages with the same name are properly
     handled on 'C-c C-v'
   * iESSremote: Evaluation with ESS remote no longer freezes emacs.
   * iESS: 'comint-previous-prompt' 'C-c C-p' no longer stops on
     secondary prompt "+".
   * iESS[R], iESS(Sqpe) [S] on Windows: The 'options("editor")' is now
     initialized to 'emacsclient' instead of the previous 'gnuclient'.
     The user may need to add the line '(server-start)' to the emacs
     initialization file.  'emacsclient' has been included with emacs
     since GNU Emacs 22.1.
   * ESS[Rnw] Fixed "connection to R" bug (in 12.09 only).
   * ESS[Rnw] Explicit 'ess-swv-stangle' and 'ess-swv-sweave' functions.
   * ESS[Rnw] Fixed completion and smart underscore problems cause by
     unmatched "\"'
   * ESS[R] is more careful with the 'R' code injection.  It now happens
     only once at the start of the session.
   * ESS[R]: Fixed auto-scrolling the comint buffer on evaluation.
   * ESS[Julia]: Solve several indentation and word navigation problems.
   * ESS[Julia]: Help system works again.

   Changes/New Features in 12.09:

   * Due to XEmacs lacking some features that ESS requires, ESS support
     of XEmacs ends with ESS 12.04-4.  This decision will be re-visited
     in the future as XEmacs continues to sync with GNU Emacs.

   * ESS[R]: On Windows, there is now a new customizable variable
     (currently called 'ess-directory-containing-R') to tell ESS where
     to look for the 'Rterm.exe' executables.  The name of the variable
     and the values it can take are both in beta and subject to change.
     Prior to this variable, ESS searched only in the default
     installation directory.  Setting this variable now tells ESS how to
     find 'Rterm.exe' executables when they are installed somewhere
     else.

   * ESS[julia]: _new_ mode for editing julia code ('*.jl').  Start with
     'M-x julia'.

     Full interaction interface, imenu and basic error referencing are
     available.

   * ESS[R] noweb: 'noweb-mode' and 'noweb-font-lock-mode' have been
     renamed to 'ess-noweb-mode' and 'ess-noweb-font-lock-mode' to avoid
     conflicts with the "real" 'noweb-mode'.

   * ESS[R] noweb: The long standing font-lock bug has been solved in
     'ess-noweb' interface.

   * ESS: Basic evaluation keys are now bound to 'ess-eval-region-*-'
     functions:

        - 'C-M-x' is bound to 'ess-eval-region-or-function-or-paragraph'
        - 'C-c C-c' is bound to
          'ess-eval-region-or-function-or-paragraph-and-step'
        - 'C-RET' is bound to 'ess-eval-region-or-line-and-step'

     Each of these functions first evaluates the region whenever the
     region is active.

   * ESS: 'C-M-a'/'C-M-e' now step to beginning/end of paragraph if no
     function has been detected.

   * ESS: 'ess-eval-*-and-step' family of functions are now smarter, and
     don't step to end of buffer or end of chunk code ('@') when at the
     end of the code.

   * ESS: 'ess-handy-commands' function is bound to 'C-c h'

   * ESS: ESS is now _blinking_ the evaluated region.  Set
     'ess-blink-region' to nil to deactivate; 'ess-blink-delay' gives
     the duration of the blink.  Evaluated region is "blinked" in
     'highlight' face.

   * ESS[R-help] New key 'a' for "apropos()" in help buffers.  Also
     available through 'C-c h'.

   * ESS[R-help] All R commands of type foo?bar and foo??bar are
     recognized and redirected into appropriate *ESS-help* buffers.

   * ESS[R]: New customization interface for _font-lock_.

     ESS font-lock operates with predefined keywords.  Default keywords
     are listed in 'ess-R-font-lock-keywords' and
     'inferior-R-font-lock-keywords', which see.  The user can easily
     customize those by adding new keywords.  These variables can also
     be interactively accessed and saved through 'ESS/Font-lock'
     submenu.

     Several new fontification keywords have been added.  Most notably
     the keywords for highlighting of function calls, numbers and
     operators.

   * ESS[R]: auto-complete is now activated by default whenever
     auto-complete package is detected.  Set 'ess-use-auto-complete' to
     nil to deactivate.
   * ESS[R]: R AC sources are no longer auto-starting at 0 characters
     but at the default 'ac-auto-start' characters.
   * ESS no longer redefines default ac-sources, but only appends
     'ac-source-filename' to it.
   * ESS: 'ac-source-R' now concatenates " = " to function arguments.

   * ESS: Menus for ESS and iESS have been reorganized and enriched with
     _Tracebug_ and _Developer_ submenus.

   * ESS[R]: 'ess-developer' and 'ess-tracebug' commands are available
     by default in 'ess-dev-map' which is bound to 'C-c d' in ESS and
     iESS maps.

   * ESS[R]: 'eldoc' truncates long lines whenever
     'eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p' is non-nil (the default).  Set
     this variable to t if you insist on multiline eldoc.  See also
     'ess-eldoc-abbreviation-style'.

   * ESS[R]: completion code pre-caches arguments of heavy generics such
     as 'plot' and 'print' to eliminated the undesirable delay on first
     request.

   * iESS: Prompts in inferior buffers are now highlighted uniformly
     with 'comint-highlight-prompt' face.

   * ESS[R]: R process no longer wait for the completion of input in
     inferior buffer.  Thus, long running commands like 'Sys.sleep(5)'
     no longer stall emacs.

   * ESS: [R, S, Stata, Julia] have specialized 'ess-X-post-run-hook's,
     which are run at the end of subprocess initialization.

   * ESS[Stata]: All interactive evaluation commands work as expected.
     On-line comments are removed before the evaluation and multiline
     comments are skipped on 'C-c C-c' and other interactive commands.

   * ESS no longer auto-connects to a subprocess with a different
     dialect than the current buffer's one.

   * ESS: 'ess-arg-function-offset-new-line' is now a list for all the
     ESS indentation styles, which results in the following indentation
     after an open "(":

       a <- some.function(other.function(
          arg1,
          arg2)

   * ESS[SAS]: Improved MS RTF support for GNU Emacs; try
     'ess-sas-rtf-portrait' and 'ess-sas-rtf-landscape'.

   Changes/Bug Fixes in 12.04-3:
   * ESS: basic support for package.el compatibility
   * ESS[R]: correct indentation of & and | continuation lines
   * 'M-x ess-version' shows the svn revision even after 'make install'
   * ESS[SAS]: improved XEmacs support
   * iESS[R]: better finding of previous prompt
   * ESS[Stata]: adjusted prompt for mata mode
   * ESS[R]: resolved name clashes with cl.el
   * ESS[R]: removed dependence on obsolete package assoc
   * New 'make' target 'lisp', to build the lisp-only part, i.e., not
     building the docs.

   Changes/New Features in 12.04-1:
   * iESS[Stata]: New interactive help invocation.
   * iESS[Stata]: New custom variable 'inferior-STA-start-file'.
   * iESS[Stata]: 'inferior-STA-program-name' is now "stata" and can be
     customized.
   * ESS[Stata] New sections in stata help files Syntax('s-S'),
     Remarks('r'), Title('t').

   Bug Fixes in 12.04-1:
   * ESS[R]: Better 'ess-tracebug' error handling.
   * ESS[R]: Corrected 'ess-eldoc' help string filtering and improved
     argument caching.
   * ESS[R]: Indentation of non-block if/else/for/while lines fixed.
   * 'M-x ess-version' should work better.
   * ESS: Filename completion now again works inside strings.
   * iESS[Stata]: Fixed prompt detection issue.
   * ESS[Rd]: R is autostarted also from here, when needed.

   Changes/New Features in 12.04:
   * ESS: Reverting new behavior of 12.03, 'TAB' in 'ess-mode' no longer
     completes by default.  If you want smart 'TAB' completion in R and
     S scripts, similarly to iESS behavior, set the variable
     'ess-tab-complete-in-script' to 't'.  Also see
     'ess-first-tab-never-complete' for how to customize where first
     'TAB' is allowed to complete.
   * ESS: completion is consistently bound to 'M-TAB' (aka 'M-C-i') in
     both Emacs23 and Emacs24.
   * ESS: The variable 'ess-arg-function-offset-new-line' introduced in
     ESS(12.03) now accepts a list with the first element a number to
     indicate that the offset should be computed from the indent of the
     previous line.  For example setting it to '(2) results in:

       a <- some.function(
         arg1,
         arg2)

   Changes/New Features in 12.03:
   * ESS indentation: new offset variable
     'ess-arg-function-offset-new-line' controlling for the indentation
     of lines immediately following open '('.  This is useful to shift
     backwards function arguments after a long function call expression:

       a <- some.function(
              arg1,
              arg2)

     instead of the old

       a <- some.function(
                          arg1,
                          arg2)

     If '(' is not followed by new line the behavior is unchanged:

       a <- some.function(arg1,
                          arg2)

     This variable should be set as part of indentation style lists, or
     in ess-mode hook.
   * ESS[R]: 'C-c .' sets (indentation) style.
   * ESS: In ESS buffers 'yank'('C-y') command accepts double argument
     'C-u C-u' to paste commands only.  It deletes any lines not
     beginning with a prompt, and then removes the prompt from those
     lines that remain.  Useful to paste code from emails,
     documentation, inferior ESS buffers or transcript files.
   * Documentation: ESS user manual has been rearranged and completed
     with several new chapters and sections to reflect newly added
     features ("Completion", "Developing with ESS", "ESS tracebug", "ESS
     developer", "ESS ElDoc", "IDO Completion" and "Evaluating Code")
   * RefCard: Reference card was updated to include new features.
   * Eldoc: Eldoc was rewritten and is activated by default.  See
     'ess-use-eldoc', 'ess-eldoc-show-on-symbol',
     'ess-eldoc-abbreviation-style' variables for how to change the
     default behavior.  _Note:_ 'skeleton-pair-insert-maybe' prohibits
     eldoc display, on '(' insertion.
   * ESS[R]: Eldoc shows arguments of a generic function whenever found.
   * ESS: 'TAB' in 'ess-mode' now indents and completes, if there is
     nothing to indent.  Set 'ess-first-tab-never-completes-p' to 't' to
     make 'TAB' never complete on first invocation.  Completion
     mechanism is similar to the completion in the 'inferior-ess-mode' -
     a filename expansion is tried, if not found ESS completes the
     symbol by querying the process.
   * ESS for emacs version 24 or higher: ESS is fully compatible with
     the emacs 24 completion scheme, i.e.  all the completion is done by
     'completion-at-point'.  Also in accordance with emacs conventions,
     ESS doesn't bind 'M-TAB' for emacs 24 or higher.  'M-TAB' calls the
     default 'complete-symbol'.

   * ESS[R]: Out of the box integration with 'Auto Completion' mode
     http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete
     (http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete) .  Three AC sources
     'ac-source-R-args', 'ac-source-R-objects' and 'ac-source-R' are
     provided.  The last one combines the previous two and makes them
     play nicely together.  Set 'ess-use-auto-complete' to 't' to start
     using it.  Refer to documentation string of 'ac-use-auto-complete'
     for further information.
   * ESS[R]: New unified and fast argument completion system, comprised
     of 'ess-funname.start', 'ess-function-arguments',
     'ess-get-object-at-point'.  Eldoc and auto-completion integration
     are using this system.
   * ESS: 'ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS'('C-c C-z'), and
     'ess-switch-to-ESS'('C-c C-y'): Automatically start the process
     whenever needed.
   * ESS[R]: 'roxy' knows about previewing text version of the
     documentation.  Bound to 'C-c C-e t'.
   * ESS[R]: Solved the "nil filename" bug in roxygen support.
   * ESS[R]: 'ess-tracebug' is now part of ESS:

     New Features:

        - Source injection: Tracebug now can inject source references on
          the fly during code evaluation, i.e.  you don't have to source
          your file, but just evaluate your code in normal fashion.
          Variable 'ess-tracebug-inject-source-p' controls this behavior
          - if t, always inject source reference, if ''function', inject
          only for functions (this is the default), if 'nil', never
          inject.

          During the source injection the value of 'ess-eval-visibly' is
          ignored.
        - Org-mode support: Visual debugger is now aware of the
          temporary org source editing buffer ('C-c '') and jumps
          through this buffers if still alive, or in original org buffer
          otherwise.
        - New keys in watch mode: '?' and 'd'
        - Two new hooks: ess-tracebug-enter-hook and
          ess-tracebug-exit-hook

   * ESS[R]: New package 'ess-developer' to evaluate 'R' code directly
     in the package environment and namespace.  It can be toggled on and
     off with 'C-c d t'.  When 'ess-developer' is on all ESS evaluation
     commands are redefined to evaluate code in appropriate
     environments.  Add package names to the list of your development
     packages with 'C-d a', and remove with 'C-d r'.  Source the current
     file with 'C-d s'.Evaluation function which depend on
     '`ess-eval-region'' ask for the package to source the code into,
     'ess-eval-function' and alternatives search for the function name
     in the development packages' environment and namespace and insert
     the definition accordingly.  See the documentation section
     "Developing with ESS/ESS developer" for more details.

   * ESS[R] help system:

     New Features:

        - 'q' quits window instead of calling
          'ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS'.  This is consistent with emacs
          behavior help and other special buffers (_breaking change_).
        - 'k' kills window without asking for the name (pointed by Sam
          Steingold)
        - Help map inherits from 'special-mode-map' as sugested by Sam
          Steingold.
        - Package index: new function 'ess-display-index' bound to 'i'
          in help mode map.
        - Package vignettes: new function 'ess-display-vignettes' bound
          to 'v' in help mode map.
        - Display help in HTML browser: new function
          'ess-display-help-in-browser' bound to 'w' in help mode map.
          It depends on 'R''s 'browser' option.
        - New custom variable 'ess-help-pop-to-buffer': if non-nil ESS
          help buffers are given focus on display.  The default is 't'
          (_breaking change_).
        - New menu entries for the above functions.
        - Bogus help buffers are no longer generated by default, i.e.
          buffers of the form "No documentation for 'foo' in specified
          packages and libraries: you could try '??foo' ".
          'ess-help-kill-bogus-buffers' now defaults to 't'.  Beware,
          there may be instances where the default is unsatisfactory
          such as debugging and/or during R development.  Thanks to Ross
          Boylan for making the suggestion, Sam Steingold for reminding
          us of this variable and Martin Maechler for the warning.
   * ESS now uses 'IDO' completing read functionality for all the
     interactive requests.  It uses ido completion mechanism whenever
     available, and falls back on classical completing-read otherwise.
     You can set 'ess-use-ido' to nil if you don't want the IDO
     completion.  See the documentation string of 'ess-use-ido' for more
     information about 'IDO' and ESS configuration.

   * ESS[S]: "','" is bound to ess-smart-comma: If comma is invoked at
     the process marker of an ESS inferior buffer, request and execute a
     command from '`ess-handy-commands'' list.  If
     'ess-R-smart-operators' is t '`ess-smart-comma' also inserts " "
     after comma.
   * ESS[S], notably 'R': Variable '`ess-handy-commands'' stores an
     alist of useful commands which are called by 'ess-smart-comma' in
     the inferior buffer.

     Currently containing:

     change-directory
          'ess-change-directory'
     help-index
          'ess-display-index'
     help-object
          'ess-display-help-on-object'
     vignettes
          'ess-display-vignettes'
     objects[ls]
          'ess-execute-objects'
     search
          'ess-execute-search'
     set-width
          'ess-execute-screen-options'
     install.packages
          'ess-install.packages'
     library
          'ess-library'
     setRepos
          'ess-setRepositories'
     sos
          'ess-sos'

     Handy commands: 'ess-library', 'ess-install.packages', etc - ask
     for item with completion and execute the correspond command.
     'ess-sos' is a interface to 'findFn' function in package 'sos'.  If
     package 'sos' is not found, ask user for interactive install.

   * ESS: New dynamic mode line indicator: Process status is
     automatically reflected in all mode-lines of associated with the
     process buffers.  Particularly useful for displaying debug status
     of 'ess-tracebug' and developer status of 'ess-developer' in all
     associated buffers.

   * ESS: New 'ess-completing-read' mechanism: ESS uses 'ido'
     completions whenever possible.  Variable 'ess-use-ido' controls
     whether to use ido completion or not.  Active by default.

   * ESS now supports comint fields for output and input detection.
     This feature is not used by default, but might be useful in the
     future.

   * ESS[S]: New custom variable 'inferior-ess-S-prompt' to customize
     prompt detection regular expression in the inferior ESS buffers.
     You can customize this variable to enhance comint navigation
     ('comint-previous-prompt' and 'comint-next-prompt') the inferior
     buffers.

   * ESS[R]: Internal 'R' completion retrieval
     ('ess-R-complete-object-name') was rewritten and is faster now.

   * ESS is using process plist to store process specific variables, as
     opposed to buffer local variables as it was using before.  The use
     of buffer local variables to store process variables is
     discouraged.

   * ESS: new functions to manipulate process plists: 'ess-process-get'
     and 'ess-process-set'.

   * ESS: Internal process waiting mechanism was completely rewritten.
     ESS no more relies on prompt regular expressions for the prompt
     detection.  The only requirement on the primary process prompt is
     to end in '> '.  This could be overwritten by setting
     'inferor-ess-primary-prompt'.

   * ESS[S], notably 'R': Saved command history: ESS-HISTORY-FILE now
     accepts 't' (default), 'nil', or a file name.  By setting it to
     'nil' no command line history is saved anymore.
     ESS-HISTORY-DIRECTORY now allows to have the history all saved in
     one "central" file.
   * ESS[R]: more Roxygen improvements.
   * ESS[R]: 'C-c .' to set (indentation) style.

   * ESS[R]: Functions with non-standard names (for example
     'aaa-bbb:cc') are properly handled by font-lock and evaluation
     routines.
   * ESS[R]:Several regexp bugs (described in etc/R-ESS-bugs.el) were
     fixed in 'ess-get-words-from-vector' and 'ess-command'.

1.3 Authors of and contributors to ESS
======================================

The ESS environment is built on the open-source projects of many
contributors, dating back to 1989 where Doug Bates and Ed Kademan wrote
S-mode to edit S and Splus files in GNU Emacs.  Frank Ritter and Mike
Meyer added features, creating version 2.  Meyer and David Smith made
further contributions, creating version 3.  For version 4, David Smith
provided significant enhancements to allow for powerful process
interaction.

   John Sall wrote GNU Emacs macros for SAS source code around 1990.
Tom Cook added functions to submit jobs, review listing and log files,
and produce basic views of a dataset, thus creating a SAS-mode which was
distributed in 1994.

   In 1994, A.J. Rossini extended S-mode to support XEmacs.  Together
with extensions written by Martin Maechler, this became version 4.7 and
supported S, Splus, and R. In 1995, Rossini extended SAS-mode to work
with XEmacs.

   In 1997, Rossini merged S-mode and SAS-mode into a single Emacs
package for statistical programming; the product of this marriage was
called ESS version 5.  Richard M. Heiberger designed the inferior mode
for interactive SAS and SAS-mode was further integrated into ESS. Thomas
Lumley's Stata mode, written around 1996, was also folded into ESS. More
changes were made to support additional statistical languages,
particularly XLispStat.

   ESS initially worked only with Unix statistics packages that used
standard-input and standard-output for both the command-line interface
and batch processing.  ESS could not communicate with statistical
packages that did not use this protocol.  This changed in 1998 when
Brian Ripley demonstrated use of the Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)
protocol with ESS. Heiberger then used DDE to provide interactive
interfaces for Windows versions of Splus.  In 1999, Rodney A. Sparapani
and Heiberger implemented SAS batch for ESS relying on files, rather
than standard-input/standard-output, for Unix, Windows and Mac.  In
2001, Sparapani added BUGS batch file processing to ESS for Unix and
Windows.

1.4 Getting the latest version of ESS
=====================================

The latest released version of ESS is always available on the web at:
ESS web page (http://ess.r-project.org) or StatLib
(http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/)

1.4.1 ESS subversion repository
-------------------------------

The latest development version of ESS is available via
<https://svn.R-project.org/ESS/>, the ESS Subversion repository.  If you
have a Subversion client (see <http://subversion.tigris.org/>), you can
download the sources using:
     % svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk PATH
which will put the ESS files into directory PATH.  Later, within that
directory, 'svn update' will bring that directory up to date.
Windows-based tools such as TortoiseSVN are also available for
downloading the files.  Alternatively, you can browse the sources with a
web browser at: ESS SVN site (https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk).
However, please use a subversion client instead to minimize the load
when retrieving.

   If you remove other versions of ESS from your emacs load-path, you
can then use the development version by adding the following to .emacs:

     (load "/path/to/ess-svn/lisp/ess-site.el")

   Note that https is required, and that the SSL certificate for the
Subversion server of the R project is

1.4.2 Git for development
-------------------------

For development and experimentation on new features, there is now a
GitHub branch for ESS, available at <https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS>.


File: ess.info,  Node: Manual,  Prev: Latest version,  Up: Introduction

1.5 How to read this manual
===========================

If you need to install ESS, read *note Installation:: for details on
what needs to be done before proceeding to the next chapter.

   In this manual we use the standard notation for describing the
keystrokes used to invoke certain commands.  'C-<chr>' means hold the
CONTROL key while typing the character <chr>.  'M-<chr>' means hold the
META or EDIT or ALT key down while typing <chr>.  If there is no META,
EDIT or ALT key, instead press and release the ESC key and then type
<chr>.

   All ESS commands can be invoked by typing 'M-x command'.  Most of the
useful commands are bound to keystrokes for ease of use.  Also, the most
popular commands are also available through the emacs menubar, and
finally, if available, a small subset are provided on the toolbar.
Where possible, keybindings are similar to other modes in emacs to
strive for a consistent user interface within emacs, regardless of the
details of which programming language is being edited, or process being
run.

   Some commands, such as 'M-x R' can accept an optional 'prefix'
argument.  To specify the prefix argument, you would type 'C-u' before
giving the command.  e.g.  If you type 'C-u M-x R', you will be asked
for command line options that you wish to invoke the R process with.

   Emacs is often referred to as a 'self-documenting' text editor.  This
applies to ESS in two ways.  First, limited documentation about each ESS
command can be obtained by typing 'C-h f'.  For example, if you type
'C-h f ess-eval-region', documentation for that command will appear in a
separate *Help* buffer.  Second, a complete list of keybindings that are
available in each ESS mode and brief description of that mode is
available by typing 'C-h m' within an ESS buffer.

   Emacs is a versatile editor written in both C and lisp; ESS is
written in the Emacs lisp dialect (termed 'elisp') and thus benefits
from the flexible nature of lisp.  In particular, many aspects of ESS
behaviour can be changed by suitable customization of lisp variables.
This manual mentions some of the most frequent variables.  A full list
of them however is available by using the Custom facility within emacs.
(Type 'M-x customize-group RET ess RET' to get started.)  *note
Customization:: provides details of common user variables you can change
to customize ESS to your taste, but it is recommended that you defer
this section until you are more familiar with ESS.

2 Installing ESS on your system
*******************************

The following section details those steps necessary to get ESS running
on your system.

* Menu:

* Step by step instructions::
* License::
* Stability::
* Requirements::


File: ess.info,  Node: Step by step instructions,  Next: License,  Up: Installation

2.1 Step by step instructions
=============================

  1. Download the latest zip or tgz archive from ESS downloads area
     (http://ess.r-project.org/index.php?Section=download) and unpack it
     into a directory where you would like ESS to reside.  We will
     denote this directory as '/path/to/ESS/' hereafter.

     Alternatively you can use 'svn' or 'git' to fetch the most recent
     development version to your local machine with:

          svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk /path/to/ESS

     or

          git clone https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS.git /path/to/ESS

  2. Optionally, compile elisp files and build the documentation with:
          cd /path/to/ESS/
          make
     Without this step, info, pdf and html documentation and reference
     card will not be available.

  3. Optionally, install into your local machine with 'make install'.
     You might need administrative privileges:

          make install

     The files are installed into '/usr/share/emacs' directory.  For
     this step to run correctly on Mac OS X, you will need to adjust the
     'PREFIX' path in 'Makeconf'.  The necessary code and instructions
     are commented in that file.

  4. If you have performed the 'make install' step from above, just add

          (require 'ess-site)

     to your '~/.emacs' file.  Otherwise, you should add
     '/path/to/ESS/lisp/' to your emacs load path and then load ESS with
     the following lines in your '~/.emacs':

          (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ESS/lisp/")
          (load "ess-site")

  5. Restart your Emacs and check that ESS was loaded from a correct
     location with 'M-x ess-version'.

   _Note for Windows and Mac OS X users:_ The most straightforward way
to install Emacs on your machine is by downloading all-in-one
(http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs/) Emacs binary by Vincent Goulet.

   _Note for XEmacs users:_ Due to XEmacs lacking some features that ESS
requires, ESS support of XEmacs ends with ESS 12.04-4.  This decision
will be re-visited in the future as XEmacs continues to sync with GNU
Emacs.

2.3 Stability
=============

All recent released versions are meant to be release-quality versions.
While some new features are being introduced, we are cleaning up and
improving the interface.  We know that there are many remaining
opportunities for documentation improvements, but all contributors are
volunteers and time is precious.  Patches or suggested fixes with bug
reports are much appreciated!


File: ess.info,  Node: Requirements,  Prev: Stability,  Up: Installation

2.4 Requirements
================

ESS is most likely to work with current/recent versions of the following
statistical packages: R/S-PLUS, SAS, Stata, OpenBUGS and JAGS.

   ESS supports current, and recent, stable versions of GNU Emacs
(currently, specifically, the 23.x and 24.x series;
alpha/beta/pre-release versions are NOT SUPPORTED). Non-Windows users
beware: GNU Emacs 24.3 is preferable to 24.1 or 24.2: these broken
builds suffer from bug 12463
<http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=12463> which will cause
emacs and ESS to get progressively slower over time.

   Due to XEmacs lacking some features that ESS requires, ESS support of
XEmacs ends with ESS 12.04-4.  This decision will be re-visited in the
future as XEmacs continues to sync with GNU Emacs.

   To build the PDF documentation, you will need a version of TeX Live
or texinfo that includes texi2dvi (BEWARE: recent TeX Live, and some
texinfo RPMs, do NOT include texi2dvi).

3 Interacting with statistical programs
***************************************

As well as using ESS to edit your source files for statistical programs,
you can use ESS to run these statistical programs.  In this chapter, we
mostly will refer by example to running S from within emacs.  The emacs
convention is to name such processes running under its control as
'inferior processes'.  This term can be slightly misleading, in which
case these processes can be thought of 'interactive processes'.  Either
way, we use the term 'iESS' to refer to the Emacs mode used to interact
with statistical programs.

* S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere::

File: ess.info,  Node: Starting up,  Next: Multiple ESS processes,  Up: Interactive ESS

3.1 Starting an ESS process
===========================

To start an S session on Unix or on Windows when you use the Cygwin bash
shell, simply type 'M-x S RET'.

   To start an S session on Windows when you use the MSDOS prompt shell,
simply type 'M-x S+6-msdos RET'.

   S will then (by default) ask the question
     S starting data directory?
Enter the name of the directory you wish to start S from (that is, the
directory you would have 'cd''d to before starting S from the shell).
This directory should have a '.Data' subdirectory.

   You will then be popped into a buffer with name '*S*' which will be
used for interacting with the ESS process, and you can start entering
commands.


File: ess.info,  Node: Multiple ESS processes,  Next: ESS processes on Remote Computers,  Prev: Starting up,  Up: Interactive ESS

3.2 Running more than one ESS process
=====================================

ESS allows you to run more than one ESS process simultaneously in the
same session.  Each process has a name and a number; the initial process
(process 1) is simply named (using S-PLUS as an example) 'S+3:1'.  The
name of the process is shown in the mode line in square brackets (for
example, '[S+3:2]'); this is useful if the process buffer is renamed.
Without a prefix argument, 'M-x S' starts a new ESS process, using the
first available process number.  With a prefix argument (for R), 'C-u
M-x R' allows for the specification of command line options.

   You can switch to any active ESS process with the command 'M-x
ess-request-a-process'.  Just enter the name of the process you require;
completion is provided over the names of all running S processes.  This
is a good command to consider binding to a global key.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS processes on Remote Computers,  Next: S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere,  Prev: Multiple ESS processes,  Up: Interactive ESS

3.3 ESS processes on Remote Computers
=====================================

ESS works with processes on remote computers as easily as with processes
on the local machine.  The recommended way to access a statistical
program on remote computer is to start it with tramp.  Require tramp in
your .emacs file:

   '(require 'tramp)'

   Now start an ssh session with 'C-x f /ssh:user@host: RET'.  Tramp
should open a dired buffer in your remote home directory.  Now call your
favorite ESS process ('R', 'Julia', 'stata' etc) as you would usually do
on local machine: 'M-x R'.

   Alternatively you can start your process normally ('M-x R').  After
you are asked for starting directory, simply type '/ssh:user@host: RET'.
R process will be started on the remote machine.

   To simplify the process even further create a "config" file in your
'.ssh/' folder and add an account.  For example if you use amazon EC2,
it might look like following:

   Host amazon
      Hostname ec2-54-215-203-181.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
      User ubuntu
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_amazon_key.pem
      ForwardX11 yes

   With this configuration '/ssh:amazon:' is enough to start a
connection.  The ForwardX11 is needed if you want to see R graphic
device showing on the current machine

   Other ways to setup a remote ESS connection are through 'ess-remote'.

  1. Start a new shell, telnet or ssh buffer and connect to the remote
     computer (e.g.  use, 'M-x shell', 'M-x telnet' or 'M-x ssh'; ssh.el
     is available at
     <http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/src/ssh.el>).

  2. Start the ESS process on the remote machine, for example with one
     of the commands 'Splus', or 'R', or 'sas -stdio'.

  3. Start 'M-x ess-remote'.  You will be prompted for a program name
     with completion.  Choose one.  Your process is now known to ESS.
     All the usual ESS commands ('C-c C-n' and its relatives) now work
     with the S language processes.  For SAS you need to use a different
     command 'C-c i' (that is a regular 'i', not a 'C-i') to send lines
     from your 'myfile.sas' to the remote SAS process.  'C-c i' sends
     lines over invisibly.  With ess-remote you get teletype
     behavior--the data input, the log, and the listing all appear in
     the same buffer.  To make this work, you need to end every PROC and
     DATA step with a "RUN;" statement.  The "RUN;" statement is what
     tells SAS that it should process the preceding input statements.

  4. Graphics (interactive) on the remote machine.  If you run X11
     (*Note X11::, X Windows) on both the local and remote machines then
     you should be able to display the graphs locally by setting the
     'DISPLAY' environment variable appropriately.  Windows users can
     download 'xfree86' from cygwin.

  5. Graphics (static) on the remote machine.  If you don't run the X
     window system on the local machine, then you can write graphics to
     a file on the remote machine, and display the file in a graphics
     viewer on the local machine.  Most statistical software can write
     one or more of postscript, GIF, or JPEG files.  Depending on the
     versions of emacs and the operating system that you are running,
     emacs itself may display '.gif' and '.jpg' files.  Otherwise, a
     graphics file viewer will be needed.  Ghostscript/ghostview may be
     downloaded to display '.ps' and '.eps' files.  Viewers for GIF and
     JPEG are usually included with operating systems.  *Note
     ESS(SAS)--Function keys for batch processing::, for more
     information on using the F12 key for displaying graphics files with
     SAS.

   Should you or a colleague inadvertently start a statistical process
in an ordinary '*shell*' buffer, the 'ess-remote' command can be used to
convert it to an ESS buffer and allow you to use the ESS commands with
it.

   We have two older commands, now deprecated, for accessing ESS
processes on remote computers.  *Note S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere::.


File: ess.info,  Node: S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere,  Next: Customizing startup,  Prev: ESS processes on Remote Computers,  Up: Interactive ESS

3.4 S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere
=================================

These commands are now deprecated.  We recommend 'ess-remote'.  We have
two versions of the elsewhere function.  'S+elsewhere' is specific for
the S-Plus program.  The more general function 'ESS-elsewhere' is not as
stable.

  1. Enter 'M-x S+elsewhere'.  You will be prompted for a starting
     directory.  I usually give it my project directory on the local
     machine, say '~myname/myproject/'

     Or enter 'M-x ESS-elsewhere'.  You will be prompted for an ESS
     program and for a starting directory.  I usually give it my project
     directory on the local machine, say '~myname/myproject/'

  2. The '*S+3*' buffer will appear with a prompt from the local
     operating system (the unix prompt on a unix workstation or with
     cygwin bash on a PC, or the msdos prompt on a PC without bash).
     emacs may freeze because the cursor is at the wrong place.
     Unfreeze it with 'C-g' then move the cursor to the end with 'M->'.
     With 'S+elsewhere' the buffer name is based on the name of the ESS
     program.
  3. Enter 'telnet myname@other.machine' (or 'ssh
     myname@other.machine').  You will be prompted for your password on
     the remote machine.  Use 'M-x send-invisible' before typing the
     password itself.

  4. Before starting the ESS process, type 'stty -echo nl' at the unix
     prompt.  The '-echo' turns off the echo, the 'nl' turns off the
     newline that you see as '^M'.

  5. You are now talking to the unix prompt on the other machine in the
     '*S+3*' buffer.  cd into the directory for the current project and
     start the ESS process by entering 'Splus' or 'R' or 'sas -stdio' as
     appropriate.  If you can login remotely to your Windows 2000, then
     you should be able to run 'Sqpe' on the Windows machine.  I haven't
     tested this and no-one has reported their tests to me.  You will
     not be able to run the GUI through this text-only connection.

  6. Once you get the S or R or SAS prompt, then you are completely
     connected.  All the 'C-c C-n' and related commands work correctly
     in sending commands from 'myfile.s' or 'myfile.r' on the PC to the
     '*S+3*' buffer running the S or R or SAS program on the remote
     machine.

  7. Graphics on the remote machine works fine.  If you run the X window
     system on the remote unix machine you should be able to display
     them in 'xfree86' on your PC. If you don't run X Windows, or X11,
     then you can write graphics to the postscript device and copy it to
     your PC with dired and display it with ghostscript.


File: ess.info,  Node: Customizing startup,  Prev: S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere,  Up: Interactive ESS

3.5 Changing the startup actions
================================

If you do not wish ESS to prompt for a starting directory when starting
a new process, set the variable 'ess-ask-for-ess-directory' to 'nil'.
In this case, the starting directory will be set using one of the
following methods:

  1. If the variable 'ess-directory-function' stores the name of a
     function, the value returned by this function is used.  The default
     for this variable is nil.

  2. Otherwise, if the variable 'ess-directory' stores the name of a
     directory (ending in a slash), this value is used.  The default for
     this variable is nil.

  3. Otherwise, the working directory of the current buffer is used.

   If 'ess-ask-for-ess-directory' has a non-'nil' value (as it does by
default) then the value determined by the above rules provides the
default when prompting for the starting directory.  Incidentally,
'ess-directory' is an ideal variable to set in 'ess-pre-run-hook'.

   If you like to keep a record of your S sessions, set the variable
'ess-ask-about-transfile' to 't', and you will be asked for a filename
for the transcript before the ESS process starts.

 -- User Option: ess-ask-about-transfile
     If non-'nil', as for a file name in which to save the session
     transcript.

   Enter the name of a file in which to save the transcript at the
prompt.  If the file doesn't exist it will be created (and you should
give it a file name ending in '.St'); if the file already exists the
transcript will be appended to the file.  (Note: if you don't set this
variable but you still want to save the transcript, you can still do it
later -- *note Saving transcripts::.)

   Once these questions are answered (if they are asked at all) the S
process itself is started by calling the program name specified in the
variable 'inferior-ess-program'.  If you need to pass any arguments to
this program, they may be specified in the variable
'inferior-S_PROGRAM_NAME-args' (e.g.  if 'inferior-ess-program' is
'"S+"' then the variable to set is 'inferior-S+-args'.  It is not
normally necessary to pass arguments to the S program; in particular do
not pass the '-e' option to 'Splus', since ESS provides its own command
history mechanism.

   By default, the new process will be displayed in the same window in
the current frame.  If you wish your S process to appear in a separate
variable, customize the variable 'inferior-ess-own-frame'.
Alternatively, change 'inferior-ess-same-window' if you wish the process
to appear within another window of the current frame.

4 Interacting with the ESS process
**********************************

The primary function of the ESS package is to provide an easy-to-use
front end to the S interpreter.  This is achieved by running the S
process from within an Emacs buffer, called hereafter _inferior_ buffer,
which has an active 'inferior-ess-mode'.  The features of Inferior S
mode are similar to those provided by the standard Emacs shell mode
(*note (emacs)Shell Mode::).  Command-line completion of S objects and a
number of 'hot keys' for commonly-used S commands are also provided for
ease of typing.

File: ess.info,  Node: Command-line editing,  Next: Transcript,  Up: Entering commands

4.1 Entering commands and fixing mistakes
=========================================

Sending a command to the ESS process is as simple as typing it in and
pressing the <RETURN> key:

 -- Command: inferior-ess-send-input
     'RET' Send the command on the current line to the ESS process.

   If you make a typing error before pressing 'RET' all the usual Emacs
editing commands are available to correct it (*note Basic:
(emacs)Basic.).  Once the command has been corrected you can press
<RETURN> (even if the cursor is not at the end of the line) to send the
corrected command to the ESS process.

   Emacs provides some other commands which are useful for fixing
mistakes:

'C-c C-w'
     'backward-kill-word' Deletes the previous word (such as an object
     name) on the command line.

'C-c C-u'
     'comint-kill-input' Deletes everything from the prompt to point.
     Use this to abandon a command you have not yet sent to the ESS
     process.

'C-c C-a'
     'comint-bol' Move to the beginning of the line, and then skip
     forwards past the prompt, if any.

   *Note (emacs)Shell Mode::, for other commands relevant to entering
input.


File: ess.info,  Node: Transcript,  Next: Command History,  Prev: Command-line editing,  Up: Entering commands

4.2 Manipulating the transcript
===============================

Most of the time, the cursor spends most of its time at the bottom of
the ESS process buffer, entering commands.  However all the input and
output from the current (and previous) ESS sessions is stored in the
process buffer (we call this the transcript) and often we want to move
back up through the buffer, to look at the output from previous commands
for example.

   Within the process buffer, a paragraph is defined as the prompt, the
command after the prompt, and the output from the command.  Thus 'M-{'
and 'M-}' move you backwards and forwards, respectively, through
commands in the transcript.  A particularly useful command is 'M-h'
('mark-paragraph') which will allow you to mark a command and its entire
output (for deletion, perhaps).  For more information about paragraph
commands, *note Paragraphs: (emacs)Paragraphs.

   If an ESS process finishes and you restart it in the same process
buffer, the output from the new ESS process appears after the output
from the first ESS process separated by a form-feed ('^L') character.
Thus pages in the ESS process buffer correspond to ESS sessions.  Thus,
for example, you may use 'C-x [' and 'C-x ]' to move backward and
forwards through ESS sessions in a single ESS process buffer.  For more
information about page commands, *note Pages: (emacs)Pages.

File: ess.info,  Node: Last command,  Next: Process buffer motion,  Up: Transcript

4.2.1 Manipulating the output from the last command
---------------------------------------------------

Viewing the output of the command you have just entered is a common
occurrence and ESS provides a number of facilities for doing this.
Whenever a command produces a longish output, it is possible that the
window will scroll, leaving the next prompt near the middle of the
window.  The first part of the command output may have scrolled off the
top of the window, even though the entire output would fit in the window
if the prompt were near the bottom of the window.  If this happens, you
can use the following comint commands:

   'comint-show-maximum-output' to move to the end of the buffer, and
place cursor on bottom line of window to make more of the last output
visible.  To make this happen automatically for all inputs, set the
variable 'comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input' to 't' or ''this'.  If the
first part of the output is still not visible, use 'C-c C-r'
('comint-show-output'), which moves cursor to the previous command line
and places it at the top of the window.

   Finally, if you want to discard the last command output altogether,
use 'C-c C-o' ('comint-kill-output'), which deletes everything from the
last command to the current prompt.  Use this command judiciously to
keep your transcript to a more manageable size.


File: ess.info,  Node: Process buffer motion,  Next: Transcript resubmit,  Prev: Last command,  Up: Transcript

4.2.2 Viewing older commands
----------------------------

If you want to view the output from more historic commands than the
previous command, commands are also provided to move backwards and
forwards through previously entered commands in the process buffer:

'C-c C-p'
     'comint-previous-input' Moves point to the preceding command in the
     process buffer.

'C-c C-n'
     'comint-next-input' Moves point to the next command in the process
     buffer.

Note that these two commands are analogous to 'C-p' and 'C-n' but apply
to command lines rather than text lines.  And just like 'C-p' and 'C-n',
passing a prefix argument to these commands means to move to the ARG'th
next (or previous) command.  (These commands are also discussed in *note
Shell History Copying: (emacs)Shell History Copying.)

   There are also two similar commands (not bound to any keys by
default) which move to preceding or succeeding commands, but which first
prompt for a regular expression (*note Syntax of Regular Expression:
(emacs)Regexps.), and then moves to the next (previous) command matching
the pattern.

'comint-backward-matching-input regexp arg'
'comint-forward-matching-input regexp arg'
     Search backward (forward) through the transcript buffer for the
     ARG'th previous (next) command matching REGEXP.  ARG is the prefix
     argument; REGEXP is prompted for in the minibuffer.


File: ess.info,  Node: Transcript resubmit,  Next: Saving transcripts,  Prev: Process buffer motion,  Up: Transcript

4.2.3 Re-submitting commands from the transcript
------------------------------------------------

When moving through the transcript, you may wish to re-execute some of
the commands you find there.  ESS provides three commands to do this;
these commands may be used whenever the cursor is within a command line
in the transcript (if the cursor is within some command _output_, an
error is signalled).  Note all three commands involve the <RETURN> key.

'RET'
     'inferior-ess-send-input' *Note Command-line editing::.

'C-c RET'
     'comint-copy-old-input' Copy the command under the cursor to the
     current command line, but don't execute it.  Leaves the cursor on
     the command line so that the copied command may be edited.

   When the cursor is not after the current prompt, the <RETURN> key has
a slightly different behavior than usual.  Pressing 'RET' on any line
containing a command that you entered (i.e.  a line beginning with a
prompt) sends that command to the ESS process once again.  If you wish
to edit the command before executing it, use 'C-c RET' instead; it
copies the command to the current prompt but does not execute it,
allowing you to edit it before submitting it.

   These commands work even if the current line is a continuation line
(i.e.  the prompt is '+' instead of '>') -- in this case all the lines
that form the multi-line command are concatenated together and the
resulting command is sent to the ESS process (currently this is the only
way to resubmit a multi-line command to the ESS process in one go).  If
the current line does not begin with a prompt, an error is signalled.
This feature, coupled with the command-based motion commands described
above, could be used as a primitive history mechanism.  ESS provides a
more sophisticated mechanism, however, which is described in *note
Command History::.

4.2.4 Keeping a record of your S session
----------------------------------------

To keep a record of your S session in a disk file, use the Emacs command
'C-x C-w' ('write-file') to attach a file to the ESS process buffer.
The name of the process buffer will (probably) change to the name of the
file, but this is not a problem.  You can still use S as usual; just
remember to save the file before you quit Emacs with 'C-x C-s'.  You can
make ESS prompt you for a filename in which to save the transcript every
time you start S by setting the variable 'ess-ask-about-transfile' to
't'; *Note Customizing startup::.  We recommend you save your
transcripts with filenames that end in '.St'.  There is a special mode
(ESS transcript mode -- *note Transcript Mode::) for editing transcript
files which is automatically selected for files with this suffix.

   S transcripts can get very large, so some judicious editing is
appropriate if you are saving it in a file.  Use 'C-c C-o' whenever a
command produces excessively long output (printing large arrays, for
example).  Delete erroneous commands (and the resulting error messages
or other output) by moving to the command (or its output) and typing
'M-h C-w'.  Also, remember that 'C-c C-x' (and other hot keys) may be
used for commands whose output you do not wish to appear in the
transcript.  These suggestions are appropriate even if you are not
saving your transcript to disk, since the larger the transcript, the
more memory your Emacs process will use on the host machine.

   Finally, if you intend to produce S source code (suitable for using
with 'source()' or inclusion in an S function) from a transcript, then
the command 'ess-transcript-clean-region' may be of use.  *note
Transcript Mode: Clean.

4.3 Command History
===================

ESS provides easy-to-use facilities for re-executing or editing previous
commands.  An input history of the last few commands is maintained (by
default the last 500 commands are stored, although this can be changed
by setting the variable 'comint-input-ring-size' in
'inferior-ess-mode-hook'.)  The simplest history commands simply select
the next and previous commands in the input history:

'M-p'
     'comint-previous-input' Select the previous command in the input
     history.

'M-n'
     'comint-next-input' Select the next command in the input history.

For example, pressing 'M-p' once will re-enter the last command into the
process buffer after the prompt but does not send it to the ESS process,
thus allowing editing or correction of the command before the ESS
process sees it.  Once corrections have been made, press 'RET' to send
the edited command to the ESS process.

   If you want to select a particular command from the history by
matching it against a regular expression (*note Syntax of Regular
Expression: (emacs)Regexps.), to search for a particular variable name
for example, these commands are also available:

'M-r'
     'comint-history-isearch-backward-regexp' Prompt for a regular
     expression, and search backwards through the input history for a
     command matching the expression.

A common type of search is to find the last command that began with a
particular sequence of characters; the following two commands provide an
easy way to do this:

'C-c M-r'
     'comint-previous-matching-input-from-input' Select the previous
     command in the history which matches the string typed so far.

'C-c M-s'
     'comint-next-matching-input-from-input' Select the next command in
     the history which matches the string typed so far.

Instead of prompting for a regular expression to match against, as they
instead select commands starting with those characters already entered.
For instance, if you wanted to re-execute the last 'attach()' command,
you may only need to type 'att' and then 'C-c M-r' and 'RET'.

   *Note Shell History Ring: (emacs)Shell Ring, for a more detailed
discussion of the history mechanism, and do experiment with the 'In/Out'
menu to explore the possibilities.

   Many ESS users like to have even easier access to these, and
recommend to add something like
       (eval-after-load "comint"
        '(progn
           (define-key comint-mode-map [up]
             'comint-previous-matching-input-from-input)
           (define-key comint-mode-map [down]
             'comint-next-matching-input-from-input)

           ;; also recommended for ESS use --
           (setq comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output 'others)
           (setq comint-scroll-show-maximum-output t)
           ;; somewhat extreme, almost disabling writing in *R*, *shell* buffers above prompt:
           (setq comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input 'this)
           ))
   to your '.emacs' file, where the last two settings are typically
desirable for the situation where you work with a script (e.g.,
'code.R') and send code chunks to the process buffer (e.g.  '*R*').
Note however that these settings influence all 'comint'-using emacs
modes, not just the ESS ones, and for that reason, these customization
cannot be part of 'ESS' itself.

File: ess.info,  Node: Saving History,  Up: Command History

4.3.1 Saving the command history
--------------------------------

The 'ess-history-file' variable, which is 't' by default, together with
'ess-history-directory', governs if and where the command history is
saved and restored between sessions.  By default,
'ess-history-directory' is 'nil', and the command history will be stored
(as text file) in the 'ess-directory', e.g., as '.Rhistory'.

   Experienced ESS users often work exclusively with script files rather
than in a (e.g., '*R') console session, and may not want to save any
history files, and hence have:

       (setq ess-history-file nil)

or will only want one global command history file and have:

       (setq ess-history-directory "~/.R/")

in your '.emacs' file.


File: ess.info,  Node: History expansion,  Next: Hot keys,  Prev: Command History,  Up: Entering commands

4.4 References to historical commands
=====================================

Instead of searching through the command history using the command
described in the previous section, you can alternatively refer to a
historical command directly using a notation very similar to that used
in 'csh'.  History references are introduced by a '!' or '^' character
and have meanings as follows:

'!!'
     The immediately previous command

'!-N'
     The Nth previous command

'!text'
     The last command beginning with the string 'text'

'!?text'
     The last command containing the string 'text'

   In addition, you may follow the reference with a "word designator" to
select particular "words" of the input.  A word is defined as a sequence
of characters separated by whitespace.  (You can modify this definition
by setting the value of 'comint-delimiter-argument-list' to a list of
characters that are allowed to separate words and themselves form
words.)  Words are numbered beginning with zero.  The word designator
usually begins with a ':' (colon) character; however it may be omitted
if the word reference begins with a '^', '$', '*' or '-'.  If the word
is to be selected from the previous command, the second '!' character
can be omitted from the event specification.  For instance, '!!:1' and
'!:1' both refer to the first word of the previous command, while '!!$'
and '!$' both refer to the last word in the previous command.  The
format of word designators is as follows:

'0'
     The zeroth word (i.e.  the first one on the command line)

'N'
     The Nth word, where N is a number

'^'
     The first word (i.e.  the second one on the command line)

'$'
     The last word

'X-Y'
     A range of words; '-Y' abbreviates '0-Y'

'*'
     All the words except the zeroth word, or nothing if the command had
     just one word (the zeroth)

'X*'
     Abbreviates X-$

'X-'
     Like 'X*', but omitting the last word

   In addition, you may surround the entire reference except for the
first '!' by braces to allow it to be followed by other (non-whitespace)
characters (which will be appended to the expanded reference).

   Finally, ESS also provides quick substitution; a reference like
'^old^new^' means "the last command, but with the first occurrence of
the string 'old' replaced with the string 'new'" (the last '^' is
optional).  Similarly, '^old^' means "the last command, with the first
occurrence of the string 'old' deleted" (again, the last '^' is
optional).

   To convert a history reference as described above to an input
suitable for S, you need to "expand" the history reference, using the
<TAB> key.  For this to work, the cursor must be preceded by a space
(otherwise it would try to complete an object name) and not be within a
string (otherwise it would try to complete a filename).  So to expand
the history reference, type 'SPC TAB'.  This will convert the history
reference into an S command from the history, which you can then edit or
press <RET> to execute.

   For example, to execute the last command that referenced the variable
'data', type '!?data SPC TAB RET'.

4.5 Hot keys for common commands
================================

ESS provides a number of commands for executing the commonly used
functions.  These commands below are basically information-gaining
commands (such as 'objects()' or 'search()') which tend to clutter up
your transcript and for this reason some of the hot keys display their
output in a temporary buffer instead of the process buffer by default.
This behavior is controlled by the following option:

 -- User Option: ess-execute-in-process-buffer
     If non-'nil', means that these commands will produce their output
     in the process buffer instead.

   In any case, passing a prefix argument to the commands (with 'C-u')
will reverse the meaning of 'ess-execute-in-process-buffer' for that
command, i.e.  the output will be displayed in the process buffer if it
usually goes to a temporary buffer, and vice-versa.  These are the hot
keys that behave in this way:

 -- Command: ess-execute-objects POSN
     'C-c C-x' Sends the 'objects()' command to the ESS process.  A
     prefix argument specifies the position on the search list (use a
     negative argument to toggle 'ess-execute-in-process-buffer' as
     well).  A quick way to see what objects are in your working
     directory.  A prefix argument of 2 or more means get objects for
     that position.  A negative prefix argument POSN gets the objects
     for that position, as well as toggling
     'ess-execute-in-process-buffer'.

 -- Command: ess-execute-search INVERT
     'C-c C-s' Sends the 'inferior-ess-search-list-command' command to
     the 'ess-language' process; 'search()' in S. Prefix INVERT toggles
     'ess-execute-in-process-buffer'.

   'ess-execute' may seem pointless when you could just type the command
in anyway, but it proves useful for 'spot' calculations which would
otherwise clutter your transcript, or for evaluating an expression while
partway through entering a command.  You can also use this command to
generate new hot keys using the Emacs keyboard macro facilities; *note
Keyboard Macros: (emacs)Keyboard Macros.

   The following hot keys do not use 'ess-execute-in-process-buffer' to
decide where to display the output -- they either always display in the
process buffer or in a separate buffer, as indicated:

 -- Command: ess-load-file FILENAME
     'C-c C-l' Prompts for a file (FILENAME) to load into the ESS
     process using 'source()'.  If there is an error during loading, you
     can jump to the error in the file with the following function.

 -- Command: ess-parse-errors ARG RESET
     'C-c `' or 'C-x `' Visits next 'next-error' message and
     corresponding source code.  If all the error messages parsed so far
     have been processed already, the message buffer is checked for new
     ones.  A prefix ARG specifies how many error messages to move;
     negative means move back to previous error messages.  Just 'C-u' as
     a prefix means reparse the error message buffer and start at the
     first error.  The RESET argument specifies restarting from the
     beginning.

     *Note Error Checking::, for more details.

 -- Command: ess-display-help-on-object OBJECT COMMAND
     'C-c C-v' Pops up a help buffer for an S OBJECT or function.  If
     COMMAND is supplied, it is used instead of
     'inferior-ess-help-command'.  See *note Help:: for more details.

 -- Command: ess-quit
     'C-c C-q' Issue an exiting command to the inferior process,
     additionally also running 'ess-cleanup' for disposing of any
     temporary buffers (such as help buffers and edit buffers) that may
     have been created.  Use this command when you have finished your S
     session instead of simply quitting at the inferior process prompt,
     otherwise you will need to issue the command 'ess-cleanup'
     explicitly to make sure that all the files that need to be saved
     have been saved, and that all the temporary buffers have been
     killed.

4.6 Is the Statistical Process running under ESS?
=================================================

For the S languages (S, S-Plus, R) ESS sets an option in the current
process that programs in the language can check to determine the
environment in which they are currently running.

   ESS sets 'options(STERM="iESS")' for S language processes running in
an inferior 'iESS[S]' or 'iESS[R]' buffer.

   ESS sets 'options(STERM="ddeESS")' for independent S-Plus for Windows
processes running in the GUI and communicating with ESS via the DDE
(Microsoft Dynamic Data Exchange) protocol through a 'ddeESS[S]' buffer.

   Other values of 'options()$STERM' that we recommend are:

   * 'length': Fixed length xterm or telnet window.
   * 'scrollable': Unlimited length xterm or telnet window.
   * 'server': S-Plus Stat Server.
   * 'BATCH': BATCH.
   * 'Rgui': R GUI.
   * 'Commands': S-Plus GUI without DDE interface to ESS.

   Additional values may be recommended in the future as new interaction
protocols are created.  Unlike the values 'iESS' and 'ddeESS', ESS can't
set these other values since the S language program is not under the
control of ESS.


File: ess.info,  Node: Emacsclient,  Next: Other,  Prev: Statistical Process running in ESS?,  Up: Entering commands

4.7 Using emacsclient
=====================

When starting R or S under Unix, ESS sets
'options(editor="emacsclient")'.  (Under Microsoft Windows, it will use
gnuclient.exe rather than emacsclient, but the same principle applies.)
Within your R session, for example, if you have a function called
'iterator', typing 'fix(iterator)', will show that function in a
temporary Emacs buffer.  You can then correct the function.  When you
kill the buffer, the definition of the function is updated.  Using
'edit()' rather than 'fix()' means that the function is not updated.
Finally, the S function 'page(x)' will also show a text representation
of the object 'x' in a temporary Emacs buffer.


File: ess.info,  Node: Other,  Prev: Emacsclient,  Up: Entering commands

4.8 Other commands provided by inferior-ESS
===========================================

The following commands are also available in the process buffer:

 -- Command: comint-interrupt-subjob
     'C-c C-c' Sends a Control-C signal to the ESS process.  This has
     the effect of aborting the current command.

 -- Command: ess-switch-to-inferior-or-script-buffer TOGGLE-EOB
     'C-c C-z' When in process buffer, return to the most recent script
     buffer.  When in a script buffer pop to the associated process
     buffer.  This is a single key command, that is 'C-c C-z C-z' from a
     script buffer returns to the original buffer.

     If TOGGLE-EOB is given, the value of
     'ess-switch-to-end-of-proc-buffer' is toggled.

 -- User Option: ess-switch-to-end-of-proc-buffer
     If non-'nil', 'ess-switch-to-inferior-or-script-buffer' goes to end
     of process buffer.

   Other commands available in Inferior S mode are discussed in *note
(emacs)Shell Mode::.


File: ess.info,  Node: Evaluating code,  Next: Transcript Mode,  Prev: Entering commands,  Up: Top

5 Sending code to the ESS process
*********************************

Other commands are also available for evaluating portions of code in the
S process.  These commands cause the selected code to be evaluated
directly by the ESS process as if you had typed them in at the command
line; the 'source()' function is not used.  You may choose whether both
the commands and their output appear in the process buffer (as if you
had typed in the commands yourself) or if the output alone is echoed.
The behavior is controlled by the variable:

 -- User Option: ess-eval-visibly
     Non-'nil' means 'ess-eval-*' commands display commands and output
     in the process buffer.  Default is 't'.

   Passing a prefix ('C-u') VIS to any of the following commands,
however, reverses the meaning of 'ess-eval-visibly' for that command
only -- for example 'C-u C-c C-j' suppresses the current line of S (or
other) code in the ESS process buffer.  This method of evaluation is an
alternative to S's 'source()' function when you want the input as well
as the output to be displayed.  (You can sort of do this with 'source()'
when the option 'echo=T' is set, except that prompts do not get
displayed.  ESS puts prompts in the right places.)

   Primary commands for evaluating code are:

 -- Command: ess-eval-region-or-line-and-step VIS
     Send the highlighted region or current line and step to next line
     of code.

 -- Command: ess-eval-region-or-function-or-paragraph VIS
     'C-M-x' Sends the current selected region or function or paragraph.

 -- Command: ess-eval-region-or-function-or-paragraph-and-step VIS
     'C-c C-c' Like 'ess-eval-region-or-function-or-paragraph' but steps
     to next line of code.

   Other, not so often used, evaluation commands are:

 -- Command: ess-eval-line VIS
     'C-c C-j' Sends the current line to the ESS process.

 -- Command: ess-eval-line-and-go VIS
     'C-c M-j' Like 'ess-eval-line' but additionally switches point to
     the ESS process.

 -- Command: ess-eval-function VIS NO-ERROR
     'C-c C-f' Sends the S function containing point to the ESS process.

 -- Command: ess-eval-function-and-go VIS
     'C-c M-f' Like 'ess-eval-function' but additionally switches point
     to the ESS process.

 -- Command: ess-eval-region START END TOGGLE MESSAGE
     'C-c C-r' Sends the current region to the ESS process.

 -- Command: ess-eval-region-and-go START END VIS
     'C-c M-r' Like 'ess-eval-region' but additionally switches point to
     the ESS process.

 -- Command: ess-eval-buffer VIS
     'C-c C-b' Sends the current buffer to the ESS process.

 -- Command: ess-eval-buffer-and-go VIS
     'C-c M-b' Like 'ess-eval-buffer' but additionally switches point to
     the ESS process.

   All the above 'ess-eval-*' commands are useful for evaluating small
amounts of code and observing the results in the process buffer for
debugging purposes, or for generating transcripts from source files.
When editing S functions, it is generally preferable to use 'C-c C-l' to
update the function's value.  In particular, 'ess-eval-buffer' is now
largely obsolete.

   A useful way to work is to divide the frame into two windows; one
containing the source code and the other containing the process buffer.
If you wish to make the process buffer scroll automatically when the
output reaches the bottom of the window, you will need to set the
variable 'comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output' to ''others' or 't'.

6 Manipulating saved transcript files
*************************************

Inferior S mode records the transcript (the list of all commands
executed, and their output) in the process buffer, which can be saved as
a "transcript file", which should normally have the suffix '.St'.  The
most obvious use for a transcript file is as a static record of the
actions you have performed in a particular S session.  Sometimes,
however, you may wish to re-execute commands recorded in the transcript
file by submitting them to a running ESS process.  This is what
Transcript Mode is for.

   If you load file a with the suffix '.St' into Emacs, it is placed in
S Transcript Mode.  Transcript Mode is similar to Inferior S mode (*note
Entering commands::): paragraphs are defined as a command and its
output, and you can move though commands either with the paragraph
commands or with 'C-c C-p' and 'C-c C-n'.

* Menu:

* Resubmit::                    Resubmitting commands from the transcript file
* Clean::                       Cleaning transcript files


File: ess.info,  Node: Resubmit,  Next: Clean,  Up: Transcript Mode

6.1 Resubmitting commands from the transcript file
==================================================

Three commands are provided to re-submit command lines from the
transcript file to a running ESS process.  They are:

 -- Command: ess-transcript-send-command
     'M-RET' Sends the current command line to the ESS process, and
     execute it.

 -- Command: ess-transcript-copy-command
     'C-c RET' Copy the current command to the ESS process, and switch
     to it (ready to edit the copied command).

 -- Command: ess-transcript-send-command-and-move
     'RET' Sends the current command to the ESS process, and move to the
     next command line.  This command is useful for submitting a series
     of commands.

Note that the first two commands are similar to those on the same keys
in inferior S Mode.  In all three cases, the commands should be executed
when the cursor is on a command line in the transcript; the prompt is
automatically removed before the command is submitted.


File: ess.info,  Node: Clean,  Prev: Resubmit,  Up: Transcript Mode

6.2 Cleaning transcript files
=============================

Yet another use for transcript files is to extract the command lines for
inclusion in an S source file or function.  Transcript mode provides one
command which does just this:

 -- Command: ess-transcript-clean-region BEG END EVEN-IF-READ-ONLY
     'C-c C-w' Strip the transcript in the region (given by BEG and
     END), leaving only commands.  Deletes any lines not beginning with
     a prompt, and then removes the prompt from those lines that remain.
     Prefix argument EVEN-IF-READ-ONLY means to clean even if the buffer
     is read-only.  Don't forget to remove any erroneous commands first!

The remaining command lines may then be copied to a source file or edit
buffer for inclusion in a function definition, or may be evaluated
directly (*note Evaluating code::) using the code evaluation commands
from S mode, also available in S Transcript Mode.

7 Editing objects and functions
*******************************

ESS provides facilities for editing S objects within your Emacs session.
Most editing is performed on S functions, although in theory you may
edit datasets as well.  Edit buffers are always associated with files,
although you may choose to make these files temporary if you wish.
Alternatively, you may make use of a simple yet powerful mechanism for
maintaining backups of text representations of S functions.
Error-checking is performed when S code is loaded into the ESS process.

* Menu:

* Edit buffer::                 Edit objects in a specialized buffer
* Loading::                     Loading source files into the ESS process
* Error Checking::              Detecting errors in source files
* Indenting::                   Indenting and formatting S code
* Other edit buffer commands::  Commands for motion, completion and more
* Source Files::                Maintaining S source files
* Source Directories::          Names and locations of dump files


File: ess.info,  Node: Edit buffer,  Next: Loading,  Up: Editing objects

7.1 Creating or modifying S objects
===================================

To edit an S object, type

 -- Command: ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer OBJECT
     'C-c C-e C-d' Edit an S OBJECT in its own edit buffer.

   from within the ESS process buffer ('*S*').  You will then be
prompted for an object to edit: you may either type in the name of an
existing object (for which completion is available using the 'TAB' key),
or you may enter the name of a new object.  A buffer will be created
containing the text representation of the requested object or, if you
entered the name of a non-existent object at the prompt and the variable
'ess-function-template' is non-'nil', you will be presented with a
template defined by that variable, which defaults to a skeleton function
construct.

   You may then edit the function as required.  The edit buffer
generated by 'ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer' is placed in the 'ESS'
major mode which provides a number of commands to facilitate editing S
source code.  Commands are provided to intelligently indent S code,
evaluate portions of S code and to move around S code constructs.

   Note: when you dump a file with 'C-c C-e C-d', ESS first checks to
see whether there already exists an edit buffer containing that object
and, if so, pops you directly to that buffer.  If not, ESS next checks
whether there is a file in the appropriate place with the appropriate
name (*note Source Files::) and if so, reads in that file.  You can use
this facility to return to an object you were editing in a previous
session (and which possibly was never loaded to the S session).
Finally, if both these tests fail, the ESS process is consulted and a
'dump()' command issued.  If you want to force ESS to ask the ESS
process for the object's definition (say, to reformat an unmodified
buffer or to revert back to S's idea of the object's definition) pass a
prefix argument to 'ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer' by typing 'C-u C-c
C-e C-d'.

7.2 Loading source files into the ESS process
=============================================

The best way to get information -- particularly function definitions --
into S is to load them in as source file, using S's 'source' function.
You have already seen how to create source files using 'C-c C-e C-d';
ESS provides a complementary command for loading source files (even
files not created with ESS!) into the ESS process, namely
'ess-load-file' ('C-c C-l').  *note Hot keys::.

After typing 'C-c C-l' you will prompt for the name of the file to load
into S; usually this is the current buffer's file which is the default
value (selected by simply pressing 'RET' at the prompt).  You will be
asked to save the buffer first if it has been modified (this happens
automatically if the buffer was generated with 'C-c C-e C-d').  The file
will then be loaded, and if it loads successfully you will be returned
to the ESS process.


File: ess.info,  Node: Error Checking,  Next: Indenting,  Prev: Loading,  Up: Editing objects

7.3 Detecting errors in source files
====================================

If any errors occur when loading a file with 'C-c C-l', ESS will inform
you of this fact.  In this case, you can jump directly to the line in
the source file which caused the error by typing 'C-c `'
('ess-parse-errors').  You will be returned to the offending file
(loading it into a buffer if necessary) with point at the line S
reported as containing the error.  You may then correct the error, and
reload the file.  Note that none of the commands in an S source file
will take effect if any part of the file contains errors.

   Sometimes the error is not caused by a syntax error (loading a
non-existent file for example).  In this case typing 'C-c `' will simply
display a buffer containing S's error message.  You can force this
behavior (and avoid jumping to the file when there _is_ a syntax error)
by passing a prefix argument to 'ess-parse-errors' with 'C-u C-c `'.

7.4 Indenting and formatting S code
===================================

ESS provides a sophisticated mechanism for indenting S source code
(thanks to Ken'ichi Shibayama).  Compound statements (delimited by '{'
and '}') are indented relative to their enclosing block.  In addition,
the braces have been electrified to automatically indent to the correct
position when inserted, and optionally insert a newline at the
appropriate place as well.  Lines which continue an incomplete
expression are indented relative to the first line of the expression.
Function definitions, 'if' statements, calls to 'expression()' and loop
constructs are all recognized and indented appropriately.  User
variables are provided to control the amount of indentation in each
case, and there are also a number of predefined indentation styles to
choose from.

   Comments are also handled specially by ESS, using an idea borrowed
from the Emacs-Lisp indentation style.  By default, comments beginning
with '###' are aligned to the beginning of the line.  Comments beginning
with '##' are aligned to the current level of indentation for the block
containing the comment.  Finally, comments beginning with '#' are
aligned to a column on the right (the 40th column by default, but this
value is controlled by the variable 'comment-column',) or just after the
expression on the line containing the comment if it extends beyond the
indentation column.  You turn off the default behavior by adding the
line '(setq ess-fancy-comments nil)' to your '.emacs' file.

   ESS also supports Roxygen entries which is R documentation maintained
in the source code as comments *Note Roxygen::.

   The indentation commands provided by ESS are:

 -- Command: ess-indent-or-complete
     'TAB' Indents the current line as S code.

     Try to indent first, and if code is already properly indented,
     complete instead.  In ess-mode, only tries completion if
     'ess-tab-complete-in-script' is non-nil.  See also
     'ess-first-tab-never-complete'.

 -- User Option: ess-tab-complete-in-script
     If non-'nil', 'TAB' in script buffers tries to complete if there is
     nothing to indent.

 -- User Option: ess-first-tab-never-complete
     If non-'nil', 'TAB' never tries to complete in ess-mode.  The
     default ''symbol' does not try to complete if the next char is a
     valid symbol constituent.  There are more options, see the help
     ('C-h v').

 -- Command: ess-indent-exp
     'TAB' Indents each line in the S (compound) expression which
     follows point.  Very useful for beautifying your S code.

 -- Command: ess-electric-brace
     '{' '}' The braces automatically indent to the correct position
     when typed.

   The following Emacs command are also helpful:

'RET'
'LFD'
     'newline-and-indent' Insert a newline, and indent the next line.
     (Note that most keyboards nowadays do not have a <LINEFEED> key,
     but <RET> and 'C-j' are equivalent.)

'M-;'
     'indent-for-comment' Indents an existing comment line
     appropriately, or inserts an appropriate comment marker.

File: ess.info,  Node: Styles,  Up: Indenting

7.4.1 Changing indentation styles
---------------------------------

The combined value of nine variables that control indentation are
collectively termed a style.  ESS provides several styles covering the
common styles of indentation: 'DEFAULT', 'OWN', 'GNU', 'BSD', 'K&R',
'C++', 'RRR', 'CLB'.  The variable 'ess-style-alist' lists the value of
each indentation variable per style.

 -- Command: ess-set-style
     'C-c .' Sets the formatting style in this buffer to be one of the
     predefined styles, including 'GNU', 'BSD', 'K&R', 'CLB', and 'C++'.
     The 'DEFAULT' style uses the default values for the indenting
     variables; The 'OWN' style allows you to use your own private
     values of the indentation variable, see below.
          (setq ess-default-style 'C++)

 -- User Option: ess-default-style
     The default value of 'ess-style'.  See the variable
     'ess-style-alist' for how these groups (DEFAULT, OWN, GNU, BSD,
     ...) map onto different settings for variables.

 -- User Option: ess-style-alist
     Predefined formatting styles for ESS code.  Values for all groups,
     except OWN, are fixed.  To change the value of variables in the OWN
     group, customize the variable 'ess-own-style-list'.  The default
     style in use is controlled by 'ess-default-style'.

   The styles 'DEFAULT' and 'OWN' are initially identical.  If you wish
to edit some of the default values, set 'ess-default-style' to ''OWN'
and change 'ess-own-style-list'.  *Note Customization::, for convenient
ways to set both these variables.

   If you prefer not to use the custom facility, you can change
individual indentation variables within a hook, for example:

     (defun myindent-ess-hook ()
       (setq ess-indent-level 4))
     (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'myindent-ess-hook)

   In the rare case that you'd like to add an entire new indentation
style of your own, copy the definition of 'ess-own-style-list' to a new
variable and ensure that the last line of the ':set' declaration calls
'ess-add-style' with a unique name for your style (e.g.  ''MINE').
Finally, add '(setq ess-default-style 'MINE)' to use your new style.

7.5 Commands for motion, completion and more
============================================

A number of commands are provided to move across function definitions in
the edit buffer:

 -- Command: ess-goto-beginning-of-function-or-para
     'ESC C-a' aka 'C-M-a' If inside a function go to the beginning of
     it, otherwise go to the beginning of paragraph.

 -- Command: ess-goto-end-of-function-or-para
     'ESC C-e' aka 'C-M-e' Move point to the end of the function
     containing point.

 -- Command: ess-mark-function
     'ESC C-h' aka 'C-M-h' Place point at the beginning of the S
     function containing point, and mark at the end.

Don't forget the usual Emacs commands for moving over balanced
expressions and parentheses: *Note Lists and Sexps: (Emacs)Lists.

   Completion is provided in the edit buffer in a similar fashion to the
process buffer: <TAB> first indents, and if there is nothing to indent,
completes the object or file name; 'M-?' lists file completions.  See
*Note Completion::, for more.

   Finally, 'C-c C-z' ('ess-switch-to-inferior-or-script-buffer')
returns you to the 'iESS' process buffer, if done from a script buffer,
placing point at the end of the buffer.  If this is done from the 'iESS'
process buffer, point is taken to the script buffer.

   In addition some commands available in the process buffer are also
available in the script buffer.  You can still read help files with 'C-c
C-v', edit another function with 'C-c C-e C-d' and of course 'C-c C-l'
can be used to load a source file into S.


File: ess.info,  Node: Source Files,  Next: Source Directories,  Prev: Other edit buffer commands,  Up: Editing objects

7.6 Maintaining S source files
==============================

Every edit buffer in ESS is associated with a "dump file" on disk.  Dump
files are created whenever you type 'C-c C-e C-d'
('ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer'), and may either be deleted after
use, or kept as a backup file or as a means of keeping several versions
of an S function.

 -- User Option: ess-delete-dump-files
     If non-'nil', dump files created with C-c C-e C-d are deleted
     immediately after they are created by the ess-process.

   Since immediately after S dumps an object's definition to a disk file
the source code on disk corresponds exactly to S's idea of the object's
definition, the disk file isn't needed; deleting it now has the
advantage that if you _don't_ modify the file (say, because you just
wanted to look at the definition of one of the standard S functions) the
source dump file won't be left around when you kill the buffer.  Note
that this variable only applies to files generated with S's 'dump'
function; it doesn't apply to source files which already exist.  The
default value is 't'.

 -- User Option: ess-keep-dump-files
     Variable controlling whether to delete dump files after a
     successful load.  If 'nil': always delete.  If 'ask', confirm to
     delete.  If 'check', confirm to delete, except for files created
     with 'ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer'.  Anything else, never
     delete.  This variable only affects the behaviour of
     'ess-load-file'.  Dump files are never deleted if an error occurs
     during the load.

   After an object has been successfully (i.e.  without error) loaded
back into S with 'C-c C-l', the disk file again corresponds exactly
(well, almost -- see below) to S's record of the object's definition,
and so some people prefer to delete the disk file rather than
unnecessarily use up space.  This option allows you to do just that.

   If the value of 'ess-keep-dump-files' is 't', dump files are never
deleted after they are loaded.  Thus you can maintain a complete text
record of the functions you have edited within ESS. Backup files are
kept as usual, and so by using the Emacs numbered backup facility --
*note Single or Numbered Backups: (emacs)Backup Names, you can keep a
historic record of function definitions.  Another possibility is to
maintain the files with a version-control system such as RCS *Note
Version Control: (emacs)Version Control.  As long as a dump file exists
in the appropriate place for a particular object, editing that object
with 'C-c C-e C-d' finds that file for editing (unless a prefix argument
is given) -- the ESS process is not consulted.  Thus you can keep
comments _outside_ the function definition as a means of documentation
that does not clutter the S object itself.  Another useful feature is
that you may format the code in any fashion you please without S
re-indenting the code every time you edit it.  These features are
particularly useful for project-based work.

   If the value of 'ess-keep-dump-files' is nil, the dump file is always
silently deleted after a successful load with 'C-c C-l'.  While this is
useful for files that were created with 'C-c C-e C-d' it also applies to
any other file you load (say, a source file of function definitions),
and so can be dangerous to use unless you are careful.  Note that since
'ess-keep-dump-files' is buffer-local, you can make sure particular
files are not deleted by setting it to 't' in the Local Variables
section of the file *Note Local Variables in Files: (emacs)File
Variables.

   A safer option is to set 'ess-keep-dump-files' to 'ask'; this means
that ESS will always ask for confirmation before deleting the file.
Since this can get annoying if you always want to delete dump files
created with 'C-c C-e C-d', but not any other files, setting
'ess-keep-dump-files' to 'check' (the default value) will silently
delete dump files created with 'C-c C-e C-d' in the current Emacs
session, but query for any other file.  Note that in any case you will
only be asked for confirmation once per file, and your answer is
remembered for the rest of the Emacs session.

   Note that in all cases, if an error (such as a syntax error) is
detected while loading the file with 'C-c C-l', the dump file is _never_
deleted.  This is so that you can edit the file in a new Emacs session
if you happen to quit Emacs before correcting the error.

   Dump buffers are always autosaved, regardless of the value of
'ess-keep-dump-files'.

7.7 Names and locations of dump files
=====================================

Every dump file should be given a unique file name, usually the dumped
object name with some additions.

 -- User Option: ess-dump-filename-template
     Template for filenames of dumped objects.  '%s' is replaced by the
     object name.

By default, dump file names are the user name, followed by '.' and the
object and ending with '.S'.  Thus if user 'joe' dumps the object
'myfun' the dump file will have name 'joe.myfun.S'.  The username part
is included to avoid clashes when dumping into a publicly-writable
directory, such as '/tmp'; you may wish to remove this part if you are
dumping into a directory owned by you.

   You may also specify the directory in which dump files are written:

 -- User Option: ess-source-directory
     Directory name (ending in a slash) where S dump files are to be
     written.

   By default, dump files are always written to '/tmp', which is fine
when 'ess-keep-dump-files' is 'nil'.  If you are keeping dump files,
then you will probably want to keep them somewhere in your home
directory, say '~/S-source'.  This could be achieved by including the
following line in your '.emacs' file:
     (setq ess-source-directory (expand-file-name "~/S-source/"))

   If you would prefer to keep your dump files in separate directories
depending on the value of some variable, ESS provides a facility for
this also.  By setting 'ess-source-directory' to a lambda expression
which evaluates to a directory name, you have a great deal of
flexibility in selecting the directory for a particular source file to
appear in.  The lambda expression is evaluated with the process buffer
as the current buffer and so you can use the variables local to that
buffer to make your choice.  For example, the following expression
causes source files to be saved in the subdirectory 'Src' of the
directory the ESS process was run in.

     (setq ess-source-directory
           (lambda ()
              (concat ess-directory "Src/")))

('ess-directory' is a buffer-local variable in process buffers which
records the directory the ESS process was run from.)  This is useful if
you keep your dump files and you often edit objects with the same name
in different ESS processes.  Alternatively, if you often change your S
working directory during an S session, you may like to keep dump files
in some subdirectory of the directory pointed to by the first element of
the current search list.  This way you can edit objects of the same name
in different directories during the one S session:
     (setq ess-source-directory
        (lambda ()
            (file-name-as-directory
             (expand-file-name (concat
                                (car ess-search-list)
                                "/.Src")))))

   If the directory generated by the lambda function does not exist but
can be created, you will be asked whether you wish to create the
directory.  If you choose not to, or the directory cannot be created,
you will not be able to edit functions.

8 Reading help files
********************

ESS provides an easy-to-use facility for reading S help files from
within Emacs.  From within the ESS process buffer or any ESS edit
buffer, typing 'C-c C-v' ('ess-display-help-on-object') will prompt you
for the name of an object for which you would like documentation.
Completion is provided over all objects which have help files.

   If the requested object has documentation, you will be popped into a
buffer (named '*help(OBJ-NAME)*') containing the help file.  This buffer
is placed in a special 'S Help' mode which disables the usual editing
commands but which provides a number of keys for paging through the help
file.

   Help commands:

'?'
     'ess-describe-help-mode' Pops up a help buffer with a list of the
     commands available in S help mode.

'h'
     'ess-display-help-on-object' Pop up a help buffer for a different
     object.

   Paging commands:

'b'
'DEL'
     'scroll-down' Move one page backwards through the help file.

'SPC'
     'scroll-up' Move one page forwards through the help file.

'>'
'<'
     'end-of-buffer' Move to the beginning and end of the help file,
     respectively.

   Section-based motion commands:

'n'
'p'
     'ess-skip-to-previous-section' and 'ess-skip-to-next-section' Move
     to the next and previous section header in the help file,
     respectively.  A section header consists of a number of capitalized
     words, followed by a colon.

   In addition, the 's' key followed by one of the following letters
will jump to a particular section in the help file.  Note that R uses
capitalized instead of all-capital section headers, e.g., 'Description:'
instead of 'DESCRIPTION:' and also only some versions of S(-plus) have
sections 'BACKGROUND', 'BUGS', 'OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS', 'REQUIRED
ARGUMENTS', and 'SIDE EFFECTS'.

   Do use 's ?' to get the current list of active key bindings.

'a'
     ARGUMENTS:

'b'
     BACKGROUND:

'B'
     BUGS:

'd'
     DESCRIPTION:

'D'
     DETAILS:

'e'
     EXAMPLES:

'n'
     NOTE:

'O'
     OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:

'R'
     REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:

'r'
     REFERENCES:

's'
     SEE ALSO:

'S'
     SIDE EFFECTS:

'u'
     USAGE:

'v'
     VALUE:

'<'
     Jumps to beginning of file

'>'
     Jumps to end of file

'?'
     Pops up a help buffer with a list of the defined section motion
     keys.

   Evaluation:

'l'
     'ess-eval-line-and-step' Evaluates the current line in the ESS
     process, and moves to the next line.  Useful for running examples
     in help files.

'r'
     'ess-eval-region' Send the contents of the current region to the
     ESS process.  Useful for running examples in help files.

   Quit commands:

'q'
     'ess-help-quit' Return to previously selected buffer, and bury the
     help buffer.

'k'
     'kill-buffer' Return to previously selected buffer, and kills the
     help buffer.

'x'
     'ess-kill-buffer-and-go' Return to the ESS process, killing this
     help buffer.

   Miscellaneous:

'i'
     'ess-display-index' Prompt for a package and display it's help
     index.

'v'
     'ess-display-vignettes' Display all available vignettes.

'w'
     'ess-display-help-in-browser' Display current help page with the
     web browser.

'/'
     'isearch-forward' Same as 'C-s'.

   In addition, all of the ESS commands available in the edit buffers
are also available in S help mode (*note Edit buffer::).  Of course, the
usual (non-editing) Emacs commands are available, and for convenience
the digits and <-> act as prefix arguments.

   If a help buffer already exists for an object for which help is
requested, that buffer is popped to immediately; the ESS process is not
consulted at all.  If the contents of the help file have changed, you
either need to kill the help buffer first, or pass a prefix argument
(with 'C-u') to 'ess-display-help-on-object'.

   Help buffers are marked as temporary buffers in ESS, and are deleted
when 'ess-quit' or 'ess-cleanup' are called.

   Help buffers normally appear in another window within the current
frame.  If you wish help buffers to appear in their own frame (either
one per help buffer, or one for all help buffers), you can customize the
variable 'ess-help-own-frame'.

9 Completion
************

* Menu:

* Object names::
* Function arguments::
* Minibuffer completion::
* Auto-complete::
* Icicles::


File: ess.info,  Node: Object names,  Next: Function arguments,  Up: Completion

9.1 Completion of object names
==============================

The <TAB> key is for completion.  The value of the variable
'ess-first-tab-never-complete' controls when completion is allowed
controls when completion is allowed to occur.  In 'ess-mode' <TAB> first
tries to indent, and if there is nothing to indent, complete the object
name instead.

'TAB'
     'comint-dynamic-complete' Complete the S object name or filename
     before point.

   When the cursor is just after a partially-completed object name,
pressing <TAB> provides completion in a similar fashion to 'tcsh' except
that completion is performed over all known S object names instead of
file names.  ESS maintains a list of all objects known to S at any given
time, which basically consists of all objects (functions and datasets)
in every attached directory listed by the 'search()' command along with
the component objects of attached data frames (if your version of S
supports them).

   For example, consider the three functions (available in Splus version
3.0) called 'binomplot()', 'binom.test()' and 'binomial()'.  Typing 'bin
TAB' after the S prompt will insert the characters 'om', completing the
longest prefix ('binom') which distinguishes these three commands.
Pressing 'TAB' once more provides a list of the three commands which
have this prefix, allowing you to add more characters (say, '.') which
specify the function you desire.  After entering more characters
pressing 'TAB' yet again will complete the object name up to uniqueness,
etc.  If you just wish to see what completions exist without adding any
extra characters, type 'M-?'.

 -- Command: ess-list-object-completions
     'M-?' List all possible completions of the object name at point.

   ESS also provides completion over the components of named lists and
environments (after '$'), S4 classes slots (after @), package and
namespace objects (after :: and :::).

   Completion is also provided over file names, which is particularly
useful when using S functions such as 'get()' or 'scan()' which require
fully expanded file names.

   In the Inferior ESS buffer, if the cursor is not in a string and does
not follow a (partial) object name, the <TAB> key has a third use: it
expands history references.  *Note History expansion::.

   Efficiency in completion is gained by maintaining a cache of objects
currently known to S; when a new object becomes available or is deleted,
only one component of the cache corresponding to the associated
directory needs to be refreshed.  If ESS ever becomes confused about
what objects are available for completion (such as when if refuses to
complete an object you *know* is there), the command 'M-x ess-resynch'
forces the _entire_ cache to be refreshed, which should fix the problem.


File: ess.info,  Node: Function arguments,  Next: Minibuffer completion,  Prev: Object names,  Up: Completion

9.2 Completion of function arguments
====================================

When inside a function call (i.e.  following ''(''), 'TAB' completion
also provides function arguments.  If function is a generic, completion
will provide all the arguments of 'S3' methods known to 'R'.

   A related functionality is *Note ESS ElDoc::, which displays function
arguments in the echo area whenever the point is inside a function call.


File: ess.info,  Node: Minibuffer completion,  Next: Auto-complete,  Prev: Function arguments,  Up: Completion

9.3 Minibuffer completion
=========================

From version 12.03, ESS uses 'IDO' mechanism (part of default emacs) for
minibuffer completion if 'ido.el' package is available and the value of
'ess-use-ido' it 't' (the default).  The completion command
'ess-completing-read' falls back on classic 'completion-read' interface
if this feature is not available for whatever reason.


File: ess.info,  Node: Auto-complete,  Next: Icicles,  Prev: Minibuffer completion,  Up: Completion

9.4 Integration with auto-complete package
==========================================

ESS provides three sources for 'Auto Completion' mode:
'ac-source-R-args', 'ac-source-R-objects' and 'ac-source-R'.  The last
one combines the previous two and makes them play nicely together.  See
auto-complete package documentation
(<http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/>) for how to modify and
install your own completion sources.

   For the default auto-complete ESS configuration, install the latest
version of 'auto-complete' package.  ESS automatically detect the
package and activates auto-complete in ESS buffers.

   To deactivate AC, place the following into your init file:

     (setq ess-use-auto-complete nil)

   Or, to activate auto-completion only in the 'ess-mode' buffers:

     (setq ess-use-auto-complete 'script-only)

   ESS provides AC help both for arguments and objects (default keys
'C-?' or '<f1>').  You can bind 'M-h' to display quick help pop-ups:

     (define-key ac-completing-map (kbd "M-h") 'ac-quick-help)

   'AC' binds 'M-n', and 'M-p' for the navigation in the completion
menu, which might be inconvenient if you want it to use in the inferior
R. Bind it to something else:

     (define-key ac-completing-map "\M-n" nil) ;; was ac-next
     (define-key ac-completing-map "\M-p" nil) ;; was ac-previous
     (define-key ac-completing-map "\M-," 'ac-next)
     (define-key ac-completing-map "\M-k" 'ac-previous)


File: ess.info,  Node: Icicles,  Prev: Auto-complete,  Up: Completion

9.5 Icicles
===========

Another option for comprehensively handling completion in Emacs is via
Icicles (<http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Icicles>).  It allows users to
have completions shown temporarily in the standard '*Completions*'
buffer, and interactively select completion candidates using several
methods.  As of version 2013.04.04, Icicles provides support for
completion in ESS. Please consult Icicles documentation, which is easily
accessible via 'customize-group Icicles', for more details on
installation and customization options.

   Once installed, Icicles can be activated by evaluating (maybe place
in '~/.emacs'):

     (require 'icicles)
     (icy-mode 1)

   Icicles can be toggled at any moment by typing 'M-x icy'.

   When Icicles is on, 'TAB' offers completion, provided the conditions
determined by 'ess-first-tab-never-complete' allow it.  Typing 'M-TAB'
will attempt completion regardless.  Typing 'M-?' in 'ESS' or 'iESS'
modes brings up the relevant completion candidates from which to choose.
Minibuffer input filters the available candidates.  Use 'TAB' for prefix
completion or 'S-TAB' for substring or regexp completion.  Use 'S-SPC'
to match an additional pattern (repeatable).  You can cycle among the
matching candidates, choosing with 'RET' or 'mouse-2'.

10.2 Editing documentation
==========================

ESS provides two ways of writing documentation for R objects.  Either
using the standard R documentation system or using in-source
documentation written as structured comment fields for use with the
Roxygen package.

* Menu:

* R documentation files::       Edit objects in a specialized buffer
* Roxygen::                     Loading source files into the ESS process


File: ess.info,  Node: R documentation files,  Next: Roxygen,  Up: Editing documentation

10.2.1 Editing R documentation (Rd) files
-----------------------------------------

R objects are documented in files written in the "R documentation"
("Rd"), a simple markup language closely resembling (La)TeX, which can
be processed into a variety of formats, including LaTeX, HTML, and plain
text.  Rd format is described in section "Rd format" of the "Writing R
Extensions" manual in the R distribution.  ESS has several features that
facilitate editing Rd files.

   Visiting an Rd file as characterized by its extension 'Rd' will
activate Rd Mode, which provides several facilities for making editing R
documentation files more convenient, by helping with indentation,
insertions, even doing some of the typing for you (with Abbrev Mode),
and by showing Rd keywords, strings, etc. in different faces (with Font
Lock Mode).

   Note that R also accepts Rd files with extension 'rd'; to activate
ESS[Rd] support for this extension, you may need to add

     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.rd\\'" . Rd-mode))

to one of your Emacs startup files.

   In Rd mode, the following special Emacs commands can be used in
addition to the standard Emacs commands.

'C-h m'
     Describe the features of Rd mode.

'LFD'
'RET'
     Reindent the current line, insert a newline and indent the new line
     ('reindent-then-newline-and-indent').  An abbrev before point is
     expanded if 'abbrev-mode' is non-'nil'.

'TAB'
     Indent current line based on its contents and on previous lines.
     ('indent-according-to-mode').

'C-c C-e'
     Insert a "skeleton" with Rd markup for at least all mandatory
     entries in Rd files ('Rd-mode-insert-skeleton').  Note that many
     users might prefer to use the R function 'prompt' on an existing R
     object to generate a non-empty Rd "shell" documenting the object
     (which already has all information filled in which can be obtained
     from the object).

'C-c C-f'
     Insert "font" specifiers for some of the Rd markup commands markup
     available for emphasizing or quoting text, including markup for
     URLs and email addresses ('Rd-font').  'C-c C-f' is only a prefix;
     see e.g. 'C-c C-f TAB' for the available bindings.  Note that
     currently, not all of the Rd text markup as described in section
     "Marking text" of "Writing R Extensions" can be accessed via 'C-c
     C-f'.

'C-c C-j'
     Insert a suitably indented '\item{' on the next line
     ('Rd-mode-insert-item').

'C-c C-p'
     Preview a plain text version ("help file", *note Help::) generated
     from the Rd file ('Rd-preview-help').

   In addition, when editing Rd files one can interact with a running R
process in a similar way as when editing R language files.  E.g., 'C-c
C-v' provides access to on-line help, and 'C-c C-n' sends the current
line to the R process for evaluation.  This interaction is particularly
useful when editing the examples in the Rd file.  See 'C-h m' for all
available commands.

   Rd mode also provides access to abbreviations for most of the Rd
markup commands.  Type 'M-x list-abbrevs' with Abbrev mode turned on to
list all available abbrevs.  Note that all Rd abbrevs start with a grave
accent.

   Rd mode can be customized via the following variables.

 -- User Option: Rd-mode-hook
     Hook to be run when Rd mode is entered.

 -- User Option: Rd-indent-level
     The indentation of Rd code with respect to containing blocks.
     Default is 2.

 -- User Option: Rd-to-help-command
     The shell command used for converting Rd source to help text.
     Default is 'R CMD Rd2txt'.

   To automatically turn on the abbrev and font-lock features of Rd
mode, add the following lines to one of your Emacs startup files:

     (add-hook 'Rd-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                (abbrev-mode 1)
                (font-lock-mode 1)))


File: ess.info,  Node: Roxygen,  Prev: R documentation files,  Up: Editing documentation

10.2.2 Editing Roxygen documentation
------------------------------------

The Roxygen R package makes it possible to keep the intended contents
for Rd files as structured comments in the R source files.  Roxygen can
then parse R files and generate appropriate Rd files from these
comments, fill the usage fields as well as updating 'NAMESPACE' files.
See the Roxygen documentation found via <http://roxygen.org> for more
information on its usage.  An example of an Roxygen entry for a simple R
function can look like this:

     ##' Description of the function
     ##'
     ##' Further details about this function
     ##' @title A title
     ##' @param me all parameters must be listed and documented
     ##' @return Description of the return value
     ##' @author The author
     myfun <- function(me)
       cat("Hello", me, "\n")
   The entry is immediately preceding the object to document and all
lines start with the Roxygen prefix string, in this case '##''.  ESS
provides support to edit these documentation entries by providing line
filling, navigation, template generation etc.  Syntax highlighting is
provided for Emacs but not for XEmacs.

   Roxygen is customized by the variables in the customization group
"Ess Roxy".  Customizables include the Roxygen prefix, use of folding to
toggle visibility of Roxygen entries and the Roxygen template.

   All ESS Roxygen support is defined in 'ess-roxy.el' which is loaded
by default in ESS. The following special Emacs commands are provided.

 -- Command: ess-roxy-update-entry
     'C-c C-o C-o' Generate a Roxygen template or update the parameter
     list in Roxygen entry at point (or above the function at the
     point).  Documented parameters that are not in the function are
     placed last in the list, parameters that are not documented and not
     in the definition are dropped.  Parameter descriptions are filled
     if 'ess-roxy-fill-param-p' is non-nil.

 -- Command: ess-roxy-toggle-roxy-region BEG END
     'C-c C-o C-c' Toggle the presence of the leading Roxygen string on
     all lines in the marked region (between BEG and END.  Convenient
     for transferring text to Roxygen entries and to evaluate example
     fields.

 -- Command: ess-roxy-preview-Rd NAME-FILE
     'C-c C-o C-r' Use the attached R process to parse the entry at
     point to obtain the Rd code.  Convenient for previewing and
     checking syntax.  When used with the prefix argument NAME-FILE,
     i.e.  'C-u C-c C-e C-r', place the content in a buffer associated
     with a Rd file with the same name as the documentation.  Requires
     the Roxygen package to be installed.

 -- Command: ess-roxy-preview-HTML VISIT-INSTEAD-OF-OPEN
     'C-c C-o C-t' Use the attached R process to parse the entry at to
     generate HTML for the entry and open it in a browser.  When used
     with the prefix argument VISIT-INSTEAD-OF-OPEN, i.e.  'C-u C-c C-e
     C-t', visit the generated HTML file instead.  Requires the Roxygen
     and tools packages to be installed.

 -- Command: ess-roxy-previous-entry
     'C-c C-o p' Go to start of the Roxygen entry above point.

 -- Command: ess-roxy-next-entry
     'C-c C-o n' Go to end of the Roxygen entry above point.

 -- Command: ess-roxy-hide-all
     'C-c C-o C-h' Use the hideshow mode to fold away the visibility of
     all Roxygen entries.  Hide-show support must be enabled for this
     binding to get defined.

   ESS also advises the following standard editing functions in order to
make Roxygen editing more intuitive:

'TAB'
     'ess-R-complete-object-name' Complete Roxygen tag at point.  E.g.
     doing 'TAB' when the point is at the end of '@par' completes to
     '@param'.

'M-h'
     'mark-paragraph' If the transient mark mode is active, place mark
     and point at start end end of the field at point and activate the
     mark.

'TAB'
     'ess-indent-command' If hide-show support is enabled, fold away the
     visibility of the Roxygen entry at point.

'M-q'
     'fill-paragraph' Fill the Roxygen field at point.

'C-a'
     'move-beginning-of-line' Move to the point directly to the right of
     the Roxygen start string.

'RET'
     'newline-and-indent' Insert a new line and the Roxygen prefix
     string.

10.3 ESS developer
==================

Usual ESS evaluation commands, *Note Evaluating code::, send portions of
the current buffer for the evaluation in the current environment
(usually 'R_GlobalEnv').  Often, in process of the developing packages
with namespaces, it is necessary to evaluate code directly in the
package's environment or its namespace.  The 'ess-developer' utility
provides such a functionality with minimal disruption of the usual ESS
work-flow.

   To understand how ess-developer works you must be familiar with
namespace system in R. In a nutshell, all objects defined in a package
'foo' are stored in an environment called 'namespace:foo'.  Parent
environment of 'namespace:foo' is an environment 'imports:foo' which
contains copies of all objects from other packages which 'foo' imports.
Parent environment of 'imports:foo' is the 'namespace:base'.  Parent
environment of 'namespace:base' is .GlobalEnv.  Thus functions and
methods stored in 'namespace:foo' see all the objects in .GlobalEnv
unless shadowed by objects in 'imports:foo', 'namespace:base', or
'namespace:foo' itself.  There is another environment associated with
'foo' - 'package:foo'.  This environment stores *copies* of exported
objects from 'namespace:foo' and is placed on the search() path, i.e.
if 'foo' is loaded and if you start with .GlobalEnv and iteratively call
parent.env() you will get eventually to 'package:foo'.  Thus all methods
and functions defined in .GlobalEnv can "see" objects in 'package:foo'
environment.  See also
<http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-ints.html#Namespaces>.

   In order to use ess-developer you must add names of the packages that
you are developing to 'ess-developer-packages'.  You can also do that
interactively with 'C-c C-t C-a'.  To remove packages from
'ess-developer-packages' use 'C-c C-t C-r'.  When developer mode is on,
the process mode line indicator displays a small or capital letter "d".

   If variable 'ess-developer-activate-in-package' is 't' (the default)
'R-mode' will check after visiting the file whether or not the file is
part of the package.  If visited file is part of a package listed in
'ess-developer-packages', developer mode is activated automatically.

   Developer mode is usually activated on per-file basis and a small "d"
appears in the modeline.  You can also activate ess-developer for all
buffers connected to current process.  This is done by toggling
'ess-developer' in subprocess buffer.  In this case a big "D" will
appear in the modeline.

 -- Command: ess-developer VAL
     'C-c C-t C-t' Toggle developer mode on and off.  If called from
     script buffer, toggle developer on file-by-file basis.  When called
     from process buffer, toggle developer on per-process basis.

 -- Command: ess-developer-add-package FROM-ATTACHED REMOVE
     'C-c C-t C-a' Add a package to your development list
     ('ess-developer-packages').

 -- Command: ess-developer-remove-package
     'C-c C-t C-r' Remove a package from your development list.

   When you add a package to 'ess-developer-packages', ESS will ask for
loading command.  By default there are two options 'library' and
'load_all' from 'devtools' package.  You can configure this behavior in
'ess-developer-load-on-add-commands'.  To explisitely load the package
containing current file use 'C-c C-t l'.

 -- Command: ess-developer-load-package
     'C-c C-t l' Load package with 'load_all' utility from 'devtools'
     package.

   When developer mode is on, ESS evaluation commands behave
differently:

   * 'C-c C-l' ('ess-load-file') asks for the package to source into and
     inserts all redefined objects into the package:foo or namespace:foo
     accordingly.

        - PLAIN OBJECTS and FUNCTIONS:
          If the object is found in an environment (package:foo or
          namespace:foo), and differs from the old one it is assigned
          into the corresponding environment.  If the object is not
          found it is assigned into .GlobalEnv.  The environment of
          functions is set to namespace:foo.

        - CLASSES:
          Same as plain objects, with the difference that even if the
          class definition is assigned into .GlobalEnv, it is still
          associated with the package foo.  Thus if you issue
          getClassDeff("foo") you will get a class definition with the
          slot @package pointing to package "foo".

          _Note:_ Occasionally, after adding new classes you might get
          warnings from "setClass".  This is especially true if new
          class inherits or is inherited by a class whose definition is
          not exported.  You might get something like: ' Warning: Class
          "boo" is defined (with package slot ‘foo’) but no metadata
          object found to revise subclass information---not exported? '

          You can safely ignore this warnings.

        - S4 METHODS:
          Similarly to function definitions modified methods are
          assigned in the local method table in the namespace:foo.  New
          methods are assigned into .GlobalEnv, but with the environment
          pointing to namespace:foo.  There is a suttle catch with
          method caching in R though.  See the code in
          etc/ESSR/developer.R for more details.

        - S3 METHODS:
          S3 methods are not automatically registered.  You can register
          them manually after you have inserted method_name.my_class
          into your package environment using ess-developer, like
          follows:

          registerS3method("method_name", "my_class",
          my_package:::method_name.my_class)

          If you don't register your S3 method, R will call the
          registered (aka cached) S3 method instead of the new method
          that ess-developer inserted in the package environment.

   * 'C-c C-r'('ess-eval-region' and functions that depend on it
     ('ess-eval-paragraph', 'ess-eval-buffer' etc., behave as
     ess-load-file', but restrict the evaluation to the corresponding
     region.

   * 'C-c C-f' ('ess-eval-function') and friends check if the current
     function's name can be found in a namespace:foo or package:foo for
     a 'foo' from 'ess-developer-packages'.  If found, and new function
     definition differs from the old one, the function is assigned into
     that namespace.  If not found, it is assigned into .GlobalEnv.

11.1 ElDoc
==========

In 'ElDoc' mode, the echo area displays function's arguments at point.
From ESS version 12.03, ElDoc is active by default in 'ess-mode' and
'inferior-ess-mode' buffers.  To activate it only in 'ess-mode' buffers,
place the following into your init file:

     (setq ess-use-eldoc 'script-only)

 -- User Option: ess-use-eldoc
     If 't', activate eldoc in ess-mode and inferior-ess-mode buffers.
     If ''script-only' activate in ess-mode buffers only.  Set
     'ess-use-eldoc' to 'nil' to stop using 'ElDoc' altogether.

 -- User Option: ess-eldoc-show-on-symbol
     This variable controls whether the help is shown only inside
     function calls.  If set to 't', 'ElDoc' shows help string whenever
     the point is on a symbol, otherwise (the default), shows only when
     the point is in a function call, i.e.  after ''(''.

 -- User Option: ess-eldoc-abbreviation-style
     The variable determines how the doc string should be abbreviated to
     fit into minibuffer.  Posible values are 'nil', 'mild', 'normal',
     'strong' and 'aggressive'.  Please see the documentation of the
     variable for more details.  The default filter is 'normal'.

   Ess-eldoc also honors the value of 'eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p',
which if set to 'nil', will cause the truncation of doc string
indifferent of the value of 'ess-eldoc-abbreviation-style'.  This way
you can combine different filter levels with the truncation.

11.3 Syntactic highlighting of buffers
======================================

ESS provides Font-Lock (*note Using Multiple Typefaces: (emacs)Faces.)
patterns for Inferior S Mode, S Mode, and S Transcript Mode buffers.

   Syntax highlighting within ESS buffers is controlled by:

 -- User Option: ess-font-lock-mode
     Non-'nil' means we use font lock support for ESS buffers.  Default
     is 't', to use font lock support.  If you change the value of this
     variable, restart Emacs for it to take effect.

   The font-lock patterns are defined by the following variables, which
you may modify if desired:

 -- User Option: inferior-R-font-lock-keywords
     Font-lock patterns for inferior *R* processes.  (There is a
     corresponding 'inferior-S-font-lock-keywords' for *S* processes.)
     The default value highlights prompts, inputs, assignments, output
     messages, vector and matrix labels, and literals such as 'NA' and
     'TRUE'.

 -- User Option: ess-R-font-lock-keywords
     Font-lock patterns for ESS R programming mode.  (There is a
     corresponding 'ess-S-font-lock-keywords' for S buffers.)  The
     default value highlights function names, literals, assignments,
     source functions and reserved words.

11.4 Parenthesis matching
=========================

Emacs and XEmacs have facilities for highlighting the parenthesis
matching the parenthesis at point.  This feature is very useful when
trying to examine which parentheses match each other.  This highlighting
also indicates when parentheses are not matching.  Depending on what
version of emacs you use, one of the following should work in your
initialisation file:

     (paren-set-mode 'paren) ;for XEmacs
     (show-paren-mode t) ;for Emacs

11.5 Using graphics with ESS
============================

One of the main features of the 'S' package is its ability to generate
high-resolution graphics plots, and ESS provides a number of features
for dealing with such plots.

* Menu:

* printer::                     The printer() graphics driver
* X11::                         The X11() (and other X Windows based) driver
* winjava::                     Java Graphics Device


File: ess.info,  Node: printer,  Next: X11,  Up: Graphics

11.5.1 Using ESS with the 'printer()' driver
--------------------------------------------

This is the simplest (and least desirable) method of using graphics
within ESS. S's 'printer()' device driver produces crude character based
plots which can be contained within the ESS process buffer itself.  To
start using character graphics, issue the S command
     printer(width=79)
   (the 'width=79' argument prevents Emacs line-wrapping at column 80 on
an 80-column terminal.  Use a different value for a terminal with a
different number of columns.)  Plotting commands do not generate
graphics immediately, but are stored until the 'show()' command is
issued, which displays the current figure.


File: ess.info,  Node: X11,  Next: winjava,  Prev: printer,  Up: Graphics

11.5.2 Using ESS with windowing devices
---------------------------------------

Of course, the ideal way to use graphics with ESS is to use a windowing
system.  Under X Windows, or X11, this requires that the DISPLAY
environment variable be appropriately set.


File: ess.info,  Node: winjava,  Prev: X11,  Up: Graphics

11.5.3 Java Graphics Device
---------------------------

S+6.1 and newer on Windows contains a java library that supports
graphics.  Send the commands:

     library(winjava)
     java.graph()

to start the graphics driver.  This allows you to use ESS for both
interaction and graphics within S-PLUS. (Thanks to Tim Hesterberg for
this information.)

11.6 Imenu
==========

Imenu is an Emacs tool for providing mode-specific buffer indexes.  In
some of the ESS editing modes (currently SAS and S), support for Imenu
is provided.  For example, in S mode buffers, the menubar should display
an item called "Imenu-S". Within this menubar you will then be offered
bookmarks to particular parts of your source file (such as the starting
point of each function definition).

   Imenu works by searching your buffer for lines that match what ESS
thinks is the beginning of a suitable entry, e.g.  the beginning of a
function definition.  To examine the regular expression that ESS uses,
check the value of 'imenu-generic-expression'.  This value is set by
various ESS variables such as 'ess-imenu-S-generic-expression'.


File: ess.info,  Node: Toolbar,  Next: TAGS,  Prev: Imenu,  Up: Extras

11.7 Toolbar
============

The R and S editing modes have support for a toolbar.  This toolbar
provides icons to act as shortcuts for starting new S/R processes, or
for evaluating regions of your source buffers.  The toolbar should be
present if your emacs can display images.  *Note Customization::, for
ways to change the toolbar.


File: ess.info,  Node: TAGS,  Next: Rdired,  Prev: Toolbar,  Up: Extras

11.8 TAGS
=========

The Emacs tags facility can be used to navigate around your files
containing definitions of S functions.  This facility is independent of
ESS usage, but is written here since ESS users may wish to take
advantage of TAGS facility.  Read more about emacs tags in an emacs
manual.

   Etags, the program that generates the TAGS file, does not yet know
the syntax to recognise function definitions in S files.  Hence, you
will need to provide a regexp that matches your function definitions.
Here is an example call (broken over two lines; type as one line) that
should be appropriate.

     etags --language=none
     --regex='/\([^ \t]+\)[ \t]*<-[ \t]*function/\1/' *.R

   This will find entries in your source file of the form:

     some.name <- function

   with the function name starting in column 0.  Windows users may need
to change the single quotes to double quotes.

   R version 2.9.0 introduced a front-end script for finding R tags,
which calls the 'rtags()' function.  By default, this script will
recursively search the directories for relevant tags in R/C/Rd files.
To use this script from the command line, try the following to get
started:

     R CMD rtags --help

   For further details, see <http://developer.r-project.org/rtags.html>

11.9 Rdired
===========

Ess-rdired provides a dired-like buffer for viewing, editing and
plotting objects in your current R session.  If you are used to using
the dired (directory editor) facility in Emacs, this mode gives you
similar functionality for R objects.

   Start an R session with 'M-x R' and then store a few variables, such
as:

     s <- sin(seq(from=0, to=8*pi, length=100))
     x <- c(1, 4, 9)
     y <- rnorm(20)
     z <- TRUE

   Then use 'M-x ess-rdired' to create a buffer listing the objects in
your current environment and display it in a new window:
                 mode length
       s      numeric    100
       x      numeric      3
       y      numeric     20
       z      logical      1

   Type 'C-h m' or '?' to get a list of the keybindings for this mode.
For example, with your point on the line of a variable, 'p' will plot
the object, 'v' will view it, and 'd' will mark the object for deletion
('x' will actually perform the deletion).


File: ess.info,  Node: Rutils,  Next: Org,  Prev: Rdired,  Up: Extras

11.10 Rutils
============

Ess-rutils builds up on ess-rdired, providing key bindings for
performing basic R functions in the inferior-ESS process buffer, such as
loading and managing packages, object manipulation (listing, viewing,
and deleting), and alternatives to 'help.start()' and 'RSiteSearch()'
that use the 'browse-url' Emacs function.  The library can be loaded
using 'M-x load-file', but the easiest is to include:

     (require 'ess-rutils)

   in your .emacs.  Once R is started with 'M-x R', and if the value of
the customizable variable 'ess-rutils-keys' is true, several key
bindings become available in iESS process buffers:

 -- Command: ess-rutils-local-pkgs
     'C-c C-. l' List all packages in all available libraries.

 -- Command: ess-rutils-repos-pkgs
     'C-c C-. r' List available packages from repositories listed by
     'getOptions(``repos'')' in the current R session.

 -- Command: ess-rutils-update-pkgs LIB REPOS
     'C-c C-. u' Update packages in a particular library LIB and
     repository REPOS.

 -- Command: ess-rutils-apropos
     'C-c C-. a' Search for a string using apropos.

 -- Command: ess-rutils-rm-all
     'C-c C-. m' Remove all R objects.

 -- Command: ess-rutils-objs
     'C-c C-. o' Manipulate R objects; wrapper for 'ess-rdired'.

 -- Command: ess-rutils-load-wkspc
     'C-c C-. w' Load a workspace file into R.

 -- Command: ess-rutils-save-wkspc
     'C-c C-. s' Save a workspace file.

 -- Command: ess-change-directory
     'C-c C-. d' Change the working directory for the current R session.

 -- Command: ess-rutils-html-docs
     'C-c C-. H' Use 'browse-url' to navigate R html documentation.

   See the submenu 'Rutils' under the iESS menu for alternative access
to these functions.  The function 'ess-rutils-rsitesearch' is provided
without a particular key binding.  This function is useful in any Emacs
buffer, so can be bound to a user-defined key:

     (eval-after-load "ess-rutils"
       '(global-set-key [(control c) (f6)] 'ess-rutils-rsitesearch))

   Functions for listing objects and packages ('ess-rutils-local-pkgs',
'ess-rutils-repos-pkgs', and 'ess-rutils-objs') show results in a
separate buffer and window, in 'ess-rutils-mode', providing useful key
bindings in this mode (type '?' in this buffer for a description).


File: ess.info,  Node: Org,  Next: Sweave and AUCTeX,  Prev: Rutils,  Up: Extras

11.11 Interaction with Org mode
===============================

Org-mode (<http://orgmode.org>) now supports reproducible research and
literate programming in many languages (including R) - see chapter 14 of
the Org manual (<http://orgmode.org/org.html#Working-With-Source-Code>).
For ESS users, this offers a document-based work environment within
which to embed ESS usage.  R code lives in code blocks of an Org
document, from which it can be edited in ess-mode, evaluated, extracted
("tangled") to pure code files.  The code can also be exported ("woven")
with the surrounding text to several formats including HTML and LaTeX.
Results of evaluation including figures can be captured in the Org
document, and data can be passed from the Org document (e.g.  from a
table) to the ESS R process.  (This section contributed by Dan Davison
and Eric Schulte.)


File: ess.info,  Node: Sweave and AUCTeX,  Prev: Org,  Up: Extras

11.12 Support for Sweave in ESS and AUCTeX
==========================================

ESS provides support for writing and processing Sweave
(<http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave>), building up on Emacs'
ess-noweb-mode for literate programming.  When working on an Sweave
document, the following key bindings are available:

 -- Command: ess-swv-weave CHOOSE
     'M-n s' Run Sweave on the current .Rnw file.  If CHOOSE is
     non-'nil', offer a menu of available weavers.

 -- Command: ess-swv-latex
     'M-n l' Run LaTeX after Sweave'ing.

 -- Command: ess-swv-PS
     'M-n p' Generate and display a postscript file after LaTeX'ing.

 -- Command: ess-swv-PDF PDFLATEX-CMD
     'M-n P' Generate and display a PDF file after LaTeX'ing.  Optional
     argument PDFLATEX-CMD is the command to use, which by default, is
     the command used to generate the PDF file is the first element of
     'ess-swv-pdflatex-commands'.

 -- User Option: ess-swv-pdflatex-commands
     Commands used by 'ess-swv-PDF' to run a version of pdflatex; the
     first entry is the default command.

   Sweave'ing with 'ess-swv-weave' starts an inferior-ESS process, if
one is not available.  Other commands are available from the 'Sweaving,
Tangling, ...' submenu of the Noweb menu.

   AUCTeX (<http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex>) users may prefer to set
the variable 'ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p' (available from the "ESS
Sweave" customization group) to t.  Alternatively, the same can be
achieved by activating the entry "AUCTeX Interface" from the 'Sweaving,
Tangling, ...' submenu, which toggles this variable on or off.  When the
interface is activated, new entries for Sweave'ing and LaTeX'ing
thereafter are available from AUCTeX's "Command" menu.  Sweave'ing can,
thus, be done by 'C-c C-c Sweave RET' without an inferior-ESS process.
Similarly, LaTeX'ing can be done by 'C-c C-c LaTeXSweave RET'.  In both
cases, the process can be monitored with 'C-c C-l'
('TeX-recenter-output-buffer').  Open the viewer with 'C-c C-v'
('TeX-view'), as usual in AUCTeX.

12.1 ESS[S]-Editing files
=========================

ESS[S] is the mode for editing S language files.  This mode handles:

   - proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return].
   - color and font choices based on syntax.
   - ability to send the contents of an entire buffer, a highlighted
     region, an S function, or a single line to an inferior S process,
     if one is currently running.
   - ability to switch between processes which would be the target of
     the buffer (for the above).
   - The ability to request help from an S process for variables and
     functions, and to have the results sent into a separate buffer.
   - completion of object names and file names.

   ESS[S] mode should be automatically turned on when loading a file
with the suffices found in ess-site (*.R, *.S, *.s, etc).
Alternatively, type 'M-x R-mode' to put the current buffer into R mode.
However, one will have to start up an inferior process to take advantage
of the interactive features.

12.2 iESS[S]-Inferior ESS processes
===================================

iESS (inferior ESS) is the mode for interfacing with active statistical
processes (programs).  This mode handles:

   - proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return].
   - color and font highlighting based on syntax.
   - ability to resubmit the contents of a multi-line command to the
     executing process with a single keystroke [RET].
   - The ability to request help from the current process for variables
     and functions, and to have the results sent into a separate buffer.
   - completion of object names and file names.
   - interactive history mechanism.
   - transcript recording and editing.

   To start up iESS mode, use:
        M-x S+3
        M-x S4
        M-x S+5
        M-x S+6
        M-x R

   (for S-PLUS 3.x, S4, S+5, S+6 or S+7, and R, respectively.  This
assumes that you have access to each).  Usually the site will have
defined one of these programs (by default S+6) to the simpler name:

   M-x S

   In the (rare) case that you wish to pass command line arguments to
the starting S+6 process, set the variable 'inferior-Splus-args'.

   Note that R has some extremely useful command line arguments.  For
example, '--vanilla' will ensure R starts up without loading in any init
files.  To enter a command line argument, call R using a "prefix
argument", by

   C-u M-x R

   and when ESS prompts for "Starting Args ?  ", enter (for example):

   '--vanilla'

   Then that R process will be started up using 'R --vanilla'.  If you
wish to always call R with certain arguments, set the variable
'inferior-R-args' accordingly.

   If you have other versions of R or S-Plus available on the system,
ESS is also able to start those versions.  How this exactly works depend
on which OS you are using, as described in the following paragraphs.
The general principle, regardless of OS, is that ESS searches the paths
listed in the variable 'exec-path' for R binaries.  If ESS cannot find
your R binaries, on Unix you can change the unix environment variable
'PATH', as this variable is used to set 'exec-path'.

   R on Unix systems: If you have "R-1.8.1" on your 'exec-path', it can
be started using 'M-x R-1.8.1'.  By default, ESS will find versions of R
beginning "R-1" or "R-2".  If your versions of R are called other names,
consider renaming them with a symbolic link or change the variable
'ess-r-versions'.  To see which functions have been created for starting
different versions of R, type 'M-x R-' and then hit [Tab].  These other
versions of R can also be started from the "ESS->Start Process->Other"
menu.

   R on Windows systems: If you have "rw1081" on your 'exec-path', it
can be started using 'M-x rw1081'.  By default, ESS will find versions
of R located in directories parallel to the version of R in your 'PATH'.
If your versions of R are called other names, you will need to change
the variable 'ess-rterm-versions'.  To see which functions have been
created for starting different versions of R, type 'M-x rw' and then hit
[Tab].  These other versions of R can also be started from the
"ESS->Start Process->Other" menu.

   Once ESS has found these extra versions of R, it will then create a
new function, called 'M-x R-newest', which will call the newest version
of R that it found.  (ESS examines the date in the first line of
information from 'R --version' to determine which is newest.)

   S on Unix systems: If you have "Splus7" on your 'exec-path', it can
be started using 'M-x Splus7'.  By default, ESS will find all
executables beginning "Splus" on your path.  If your versions of S are
called other names, consider renaming them with a symbolic link or
change the variable 'ess-s-versions'.  To see which functions have been
created for starting different versions of Splus, type 'M-x Splus' and
then hit [Tab].  These other versions of Splus can also be started from
the "ESS->Start Process->Other" menu.

   A second mechanim is also available for running other versions of
Splus.  The variable 'ess-s-versions-list' is a list of lists; each
sublist should be of the form: (DEFUN-NAME PATH ARGS). DEFUN-NAME is the
name of the new emacs function you wish to create to start the new S
process; PATH is the full path to the version of S you want to run; ARGS
is an optional string of command-line arguments to pass to the S
process.  Here is an example setting:
     (setq ess-s-versions-list
           '( ("Splus64" "/usr/local/bin/Splus64")
              ("Splus64-j" "/usr/local/bin/Splus64" "-j")))
   which will then allow you to do 'M-x Splus64-j' to start Splus64 with
the corresponding command line arguments.

   If you change the value of either 'ess-s-versions' or
'ess-s-versions-list', you should put them in your .emacs before
ess-site is loaded, since the new emacs functions are created when ESS
is loaded.

   Sqpe (S-Plus running inside an emacs buffer) on Windows systems: If
you have an older version of S-Plus (S-Plus 6.1 for example) on your
system, ir can be started inside an emacs buffer with 'M-x splus61'.  By
default, ESS will find versions of S-Plus located in the installation
directories that Insightful uses by default.  If your versions of S-Plus
are anywhere else, you will need to change the variable
'ess-SHOME-versions'.  To see which functions have been created for
starting different versions of S-Plus, type 'M-x spl' and then hit
[Tab].  These other versions of S-Plus can also be started from the
"ESS->Start Process->Other" menu.

12.4 Philosophies for using ESS[S]
==================================

The first is preferred, and configured for.  The second one can be
retrieved again, by changing emacs variables.

   1: (preferred by the current group of developers): The source code is
real.  The objects are realizations of the source code.  Source for
EVERY user modified object is placed in a particular directory or
directories, for later editing and retrieval.

   2: (older version): S objects are real.  Source code is a temporary
realization of the objects.  Dumped buffers should not be saved.
_We_strongly_discourage_this_approach_.  However, if you insist, add the
following lines to your .emacs file:
     (setq ess-keep-dump-files 'nil)
     (setq ess-delete-dump-files t)
     (setq ess-mode-silently-save nil)
   The second saves a small amount of disk space.  The first allows for
better portability as well as external version control for code.

12.5 Scenarios for use (possibilities-based on actual usage)
============================================================

We present some basic suggestions for using ESS to interact with S.
These are just a subset of approaches, many better approaches are
possible.  Contributions of examples of how you work with ESS are
appreciated (especially since it helps us determine priorities on future
enhancements)!  (comments as to what should be happening are prefixed by
"##").
     1:  ##    Data Analysis Example (source code is real)
         ## Load the file you want to work with
         C-x C-f myfile.s

         ## Edit as appropriate, and then start up S-PLUS 3.x
         M-x S+3

         ## A new buffer *S+3:1* will appear.  Splus will have been started
         ## in this buffer.  The buffer is in iESS [S+3:1] mode.

         ## Split the screen and go back to the file editing buffer.
         C-x 2 C-x b myfile.s

         ## Send regions, lines, or the entire file contents to S-PLUS.  For regions,
         ## highlight a region with keystrokes or mouse and then send with:
         C-c C-r

         ## Re-edit myfile.s as necessary to correct any difficulties.  Add
         ## new commands here.  Send them to S by region with C-c C-r, or
         ## one line at a time with C-c C-n.

         ## Save the revised myfile.s with C-x C-s.

         ## Save the entire *S+3:1* interaction buffer with C-c C-s.  You
         ## will be prompted for a file name.  The recommended name is
         ## myfile.St.  With the *.St suffix, the file will come up in ESS
         ## Transcript mode the next time it is accessed from Emacs.



     2:  ## Program revision example (source code is real)

         ## Start up S-PLUS 3.x in a process buffer (this will be *S+3:1*)
         M-x S+3

         ## Load the file you want to work with
         C-x C-f myfile.s

         ## edit program, functions, and code in myfile.s, and send revised
         ## functions to S when ready with
         C-c C-f
         ## or highlighted regions with
         C-c C-r
         ## or individual lines with
         C-c C-n
         ## or load the entire buffer with
         C-c C-l

         ## save the revised myfile.s when you have finished
         C-c C-s



     3:  ## Program revision example (S object is real)

         ## Start up S-PLUS 3.x in a process buffer (this will be *S+3:1*)
         M-x S+3

         ## Dump an existing S object my.function into a buffer to work with
         C-c C-d my.function
         ## a new buffer named yourloginname.my.function.S will be created with
         ## an editable copy of the object.  The buffer is associated with the
         ## pathname /tmp/yourloginname.my.function.S and will amlost certainly not
         ## exist after you log off.

         ## enter program, functions, and code into work buffer, and send
         ## entire contents to S-PLUS when ready
         C-c C-b

         ## Go to *S+3:1* buffer, which is the process buffer, and examine
         ## the results.
         C-c C-y
         ## The sequence C-c C-y is a shortcut for:  C-x b *S+3:1*

         ## Return to the work buffer (may/may not be prefixed)
         C-x C-b yourloginname.my.function.S
         ## Fix the function that didn't work, and resubmit by placing the
         ## cursor somewhere in the function and
         C-c C-f

12.6 Customization Examples and Solutions to Problems
=====================================================

1.  Suppose that you are primarily an SPLUS 3.4 user, occasionally using
S version 4, and sick and tired of the buffer-name *S+3* we've stuck you
with.  Simply edit the "ess-dialect" alist entry in the ess-sp3-d.el and
ess-s4-d.el files to be "S" instead of "S4" and "S+3".  This will ensure
that all the inferior process buffer names are "*S*".

   2.  Suppose that you WANT to have the first buffer name indexed by
":1", in the same manner as your S-PLUS processes 2,3,4, and 5 (for you
heavy simulation people).  Then add after your (require 'ess-site) or
(load "ess-site") command in your .emacs file, the line:
     (setq ess-plain-first-buffername nil)

   3.  Fontlocking sometimes fails to behave nicely upon errors.  When
Splus dumps, a mis-matched " (double-quote) can result in the wrong
font-lock face being used for the remainder of the buffer.

   Solution: add a " at the end of the "Dumped..."  statement, to revert
the font-lock face back to normal.

   4.  When you change directory within a *R* or *S* session using the
setwd() command, emacs does not recognise that you have changed the
current directory.

   Solution: Use 'M-x ess-change-directory'.  This will prompt you for
the directory to change to.  It will then change directory within the
*S* buffer, and also update the emacs variable 'default-directory'.
Alternatively, if you have already executed setwd(), press 'M-RET'
within the *S* buffer so that Emacs can update 'default-directory'.

ESS[SAS] was designed for use with SAS.  It is descended from emacs
macros developed by John Sall for editing SAS programs and 'SAS-mode' by
Tom Cook.  Those editing features and new advanced features are part of
ESS[SAS].  The user interface of ESS[SAS] has similarities with ESS[S]
and the SAS Display Manager.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS(SAS)--Design philosophy,  Next: ESS(SAS)--Editing files,  Prev: ESS for SAS,  Up: ESS for SAS

13.1 ESS[SAS]-Design philosophy
===============================

ESS[SAS] was designed to aid the user in writing and maintaining SAS
programs, such as 'FOO.sas'.  Both interactive and batch submission of SAS
programs is supported.

   ESS[SAS] was written with two primary goals.
  1. The emacs text editor provides a powerful and flexible development
     environment for programming languages.  These features are a boon
     to all programmers and, with the help of ESS[SAS], to SAS users as
     well.
  2. Although a departure from SAS Display Manager, ESS[SAS] provides
     similar key definitions to give novice ESS[SAS] users a head start.
     Also, inconvenient SAS Display Manager features, like remote
     submission and syntax highlighting, are provided transparently;
     appealing to advanced ESS[SAS] users.

13.2 ESS[SAS]-Editing files
===========================

ESS[SAS] is the mode for editing SAS language files.  This mode handles:

   * proper indenting, generated by both <TAB> and <RET>.
   * color and font choices based on syntax.
   * ability to save and submit the file you are working on as a batch SAS
     process with a single keypress and to continue editing while it is
     runs in the background.
   * capability of killing the batch SAS process through the '*shell*'
     buffer or allow the SAS process to keep on running after you exit
     emacs.
   * single keypress navigation of '.sas', '.log' and '.lst' files
     ('.log' and '.lst' files are refreshed with each keypress).
   * ability to send the contents of an entire buffer, a highlighted
     region, or a single line to an interactive SAS process.
   * ability to switch between processes which would be the target of
     the buffer (for the above).

   ESS[SAS] is automatically turned on when editing a file with a '.sas'
suffix (or other extension, if specified via 'auto-mode-alist').  The
function keys can be enabled to use the same function keys that the SAS
Display Manager does.  The interactive capabilities of ESS require you
to start an inferior SAS process with 'M-x SAS' (*Note
iESS(SAS)--Interactive SAS processes::.)

   At this writing, the indenting and syntax highlighting are generally
correct.  Known issues: for multiple line '*' or '%*' comments, only the
first line is highlighted; for '.log' files, only the first line of a
'NOTE:', 'WARNING:' or 'ERROR:' message is highlighted; unmatched
single/double quotes in 'CARDS' data lines are *NOT* ignored; in an
iterative 'DO' statement, 'TO' and 'BY' are not highlighted.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS(SAS)--TAB key,  Next: ESS(SAS)--Batch SAS processes,  Prev: ESS(SAS)--Editing files,  Up: ESS for SAS

13.3 ESS[SAS]-<TAB> key
=======================

Two options.  The <TAB> key is bound by default to 'sas-indent-line'.
This function is used to syntactically indent SAS code so 'PROC' and
'RUN' are in the left margin, other statements are indented
'sas-indent-width' spaces from the margin, continuation lines are
indented 'sas-indent-width' spaces in from the beginning column of that
statement.  This is the type of functionality that emacs provides in
most programming language modes.  This functionality is activated by
placing the following line in your initialization file prior to a
'require'/'load':
     (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle nil)

   ESS provides an alternate behavior for <TAB> that makes it behave as
it does in SAS Display Manager, i.e.  move the cursor to the next stop.
The alternate behavior also provides a "TAB" backwards, 'C-<TAB>', that
moves the cursor to the stop to the left and deletes any characters
between them.  This functionality is obtained by placing the following
line in your initialization file prior to a 'require'/'load':
     (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle t)
   Under the alternate behavior, <TAB> is bound to 'M-x tab-to-tab-stop'
and the stops are defined by 'ess-sas-tab-stop-list'.

13.4 ESS[SAS]-Batch SAS processes
=================================

Submission of a SAS batch job is dependent on your environment.
'ess-sas-submit-method' is determined by your operating system and your
shell.  It defaults to ''sh' unless you are running Windows or Mac
Classic.  Under Windows, it will default to ''sh' if you are using a
UNIX-imitating shell; otherwise ''ms-dos' for an MS-DOS shell.  On Mac
OS X, it will default to ''sh', but under Mac Classic, it defaults to
''apple-script'.  You will also set this to ''sh' if the SAS batch job
needs to run on a remote machine rather than your local machine.  This
works transparently if you are editing the remote file via ange-ftp/EFS
or tramp.  Note that 'ess-sas-shell-buffer-remote-init' is a Local
Variable that defaults to '"ssh"' which will be used to open the buffer
on the remote host and it is assumed that no password is necessary, i.e.
you are using 'ssh-agent'/'ssh-add' or the equivalent (see the
discussion about Local Variables below if you need to change the
default).

   However, if you are editing the file locally and transferring it back
and forth with Kermit, you need some additional steps.  First, start
Kermit locally before remotely logging in.  Open a local copy of the
file with the 'ess-kermit-prefix' character prepended (the default is
'"#"').  Execute the command 'M-x ess-kermit-get' which automatically
brings the contents of the remote file into your local copy.  If you
transfer files with Kermit manually in a '*shell*' buffer, then note
that the Kermit escape sequence is 'C-q C-\ c' rather than 'C-\ c' which
it would be in an ordinary terminal application, i.e.  not in an emacs
buffer.  Lastly, note that the remote Kermit command is specified by
'ess-kermit-command'.

   The command used by the 'SUBMIT' function key (<F3> or <F8>) to
submit a batch SAS job, whether local or remote, is
'ess-sas-submit-command' which defaults to 'sas-program'.  'sas-program'
is '"invoke SAS using program file"' for Mac Classic and '"sas"'
otherwise.  However, you may have to alter 'ess-sas-submit-command' for
a particular program, so it is defined as buffer-local.  Conveniently,
it can be set at the end of the program:
     endsas;
     Local variables:
     ess-sas-submit-command: "sas8"
     End:

   The command line is also made of 'ess-sas-submit-pre-command',
'ess-sas-submit-post-command' and 'ess-sas-submit-command-options' (the
last of which is also buffer-local).  Here are some examples for your
'~/.emacs' or '~/.xemacs/init.el' file (you may also use
'M-x customize-variable'):
     ;'sh default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "nohup")
     ;'sh default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser &")
     ;'sh example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "/usr/local/sas/sas")
     ;'ms-dos default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "start")
     ;'ms-dos default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser -icon")
     ;Windows example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "c:/progra~1/sas/sas.exe")
     ;Windows example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "c:\\progra~1\\sas\\sas.exe")

   There is a built-in delay before a batch SAS job is submitted when
using a UNIX-imitating shell under Windows.  This is necessary in many
cases since the shell might not be ready to receive a command.  This
delay is currently set high enough so as not to be a problem.  But,
there may be cases when it needs to be set higher, or could be set much
lower to speed things up.  You can over-ride the default in your
'~/.emacs' or '~/.xemacs/init.el' file by:
     (setq ess-sleep-for 0.2)

   For example, '(setq ess-sas-global-unix-keys t)' keys shown, '(setq
ess-sas-global-pc-keys t)' in parentheses; ESS[SAS] function keys are
presented in the next section.  Open the file you want to work with
'C-x C-f foo.sas'.  'FOO.sas' will be in ESS[SAS] mode.  Edit as
appropriate, then save and submit the batch SAS job.
     <F3> (<F8>)
   The job runs in the '*shell*' buffer while you continue to edit
'FOO.sas'.  If 'ess-sas-submit-method' is ''sh', then the message buffer
will display the shell notification when the job is complete.  The ''sh'
setting also allows you to terminate the SAS batch job before it is
finished.
     <F8> (<F3>)
   Terminating a SAS batch in the '*shell*' buffer.
     kill PID
   You may want to visit the '.log' (whether the job is still running or
it is finished) and check for error messages.  The '.log' will be
refreshed and you will be placed in it's buffer.  You will be taken to
the first error message, if any.
     <F5> (<F6>)
   Goto the next error message, if any.
     <F5> (<F6>)
   Now, 'refresh' the '.lst' and go to it's buffer.
     <F6> (<F7>)
   If you wish to make changes, go to the '.sas' file with.
     <F4> (<F5>)
   Make your editing changes and submit again.
     <F3> (<F8>)

13.5 ESS[SAS]-Function keys for batch processing
================================================

The setup of function keys for SAS batch processing is unavoidably
complex, but the usage of function keys is simple.  There are five
distinct options:

   Option 1 (default).  Function keys in ESS[SAS] are not bound to elisp
commands.  This is in accordance with the GNU Elisp Coding Standards
(GECS) which do not allow function keys to be bound so that they are
available to the user.

   Options 2-5.  Since GECS does not allow function keys to be bound by
modes, these keys are often unused.  So, ESS[SAS] provides users with
the option of binding elisp commands to these keys.  Users who are
familiar with SAS will, most likely, want to duplicate the function key
capabilities of the SAS Display Manager.  There are four options (noted
in parentheses).

  a. SAS Display Manager has different function key definitions for UNIX
     (2, 4) and Windows (3, 5); ESS[SAS] can use either.
  b. The ESS[SAS] function key definitions can be active in all buffers
     (global: 4, 5) or limited (local: 2, 3) only to buffers with files
     that are associated with ESS[SAS] as specified in your
     'auto-mode-alist'.

   The distinction between local and global is subtle.  If you want the
ESS[SAS] definitions to work when you are in the '*shell*' buffer or
when editing files other than the file extensions that ESS[SAS]
recognizes, you will most likely want to use the global definitions.  If
you want your function keys to understand SAS batch commands when you
are editing SAS files, and to behave normally when editing other files,
then you will choose the local definitions.  The option can be chosen by
the person installing ESS for a site or by an individual.

  a. For a site installation or an individual, place *ONLY ONE* of the
     following lines in your initialization file prior to a
     'require'/'load'.  ESS[SAS] function keys are available in ESS[SAS]
     if you choose either 2 or 3 and in all modes if you choose 4 or 5:
          ;;2; (setq ess-sas-local-unix-keys t)
          ;;3; (setq ess-sas-local-pc-keys t)
          ;;4; (setq ess-sas-global-unix-keys t)
          ;;5; (setq ess-sas-global-pc-keys t)

     The names '-unix-' and '-pc-' have nothing to do with the operating
     system that you are running.  Rather, they mimic the definitions
     that the SAS Display Manager uses by default on those platforms.

  b. If your site installation has configured the keys contrary to your
     liking, then you must call the appropriate function.
           (load "ess-site") ;; local-unix-keys
           (ess-sas-global-pc-keys)

   Finally, we get to what the function keys actually do.  You may
recognize some of the nicknames as SAS Display Manager commands (they
are in all capitals).

UNIX     PC       Nickname
<F2>     <F2>     'refresh'
                  revert the current buffer with the file of the same name if the file is
                  newer than the buffer
<F3>     <F8>     'SUBMIT'
                  save the current '.sas' file (which is either the '.sas' file in the
                  current buffer or the '.sas' file associated with the '.lst' or '.log'
                  file in the current buffer) and submit the file as a batch SAS job
<F4>     <F5>     'PROGRAM'
                  switch buffer to '.sas' file
<F5>     <F6>     'LOG'
                  switch buffer to '.log' file, 'refresh' and goto next error message, if
                  any
<F6>     <F7>     'OUTPUT'
                  switch buffer to '.lst' file and 'refresh'
<F7>     <F4>     'filetype-1'
                  switch buffer to 'filetype-1' (defaults to '.txt') file and 'refresh'
<F8>     <F3>     'shell'
                  switch buffer to '*shell*'
<F9>     <F9>     'VIEWTABLE'
                  open an interactive 'PROC FSEDIT' session on the SAS dataset near point
<F10>    <F10>    toggle-log
                  toggle ESS[SAS] for '.log' files; useful for certain debugging situations
<F11>    <F11>    'filetype-2'
                  switch buffer to 'filetype-2' (defaults to '.dat') file and 'refresh'
<F12>    <F12>    viewgraph
                  open a 'GSASFILE' near point for viewing either in emacs or with an
                  external viewer
'C-<F1>' 'C-<F1>' rtf-portrait
                  create an MS RTF portrait file from the current buffer with a file
                  extension of '.rtf'
'C-<F2>' 'C-<F2>' rtf-landscape
                  create an MS RTF landscape file from the current buffer with a file
                  extension of '.rtf'
'C-<F3>' 'C-<F8>' submit-region
                  write region to 'ess-temp.sas' and submit
'C-<F5>' 'C-<F6>' append-to-log
                  append 'ess-temp.log' to the current '.log' file
'C-<F6>' 'C-<F7>' append-to-output
                  append 'ess-temp.lst' to the current '.lst' file
'C-<F9>' 'C-<F9>' 'INSIGHT'
                  open an interactive 'PROC INSIGHT' session on the SAS dataset near point
'C-<F10>''C-<F10>'toggle-listing
                  toggle ESS[SAS] for '.lst' files; useful for toggling read-only

   'SUBMIT', 'PROGRAM', 'LOG' and 'OUTPUT' need no further explanation
since they mimic the SAS Display Manager commands and related function
key definitions.  However, six other keys have been provided for
convenience and are described below.

   'shell' switches you to the '*shell*' buffer where you can interact
with your operating system.  This is especially helpful if you would
like to kill a SAS batch job.  You can specify a different buffer name
to associate with a SAS batch job (besides '*shell*') with the
buffer-local variable 'ess-sas-shell-buffer'.  This allows you to have
multiple buffers running SAS batch jobs on multiple local/remote
computers that may rely on different methods specified by the
buffer-local variable 'ess-sas-submit-method'.

   <F2> performs the 'refresh' operation on the current buffer.
'refresh' compares the buffer's last modified date/time with the file's
last modified date/time and replaces the buffer with the file if the
file is newer.  This is the same operation that is automatically
performed when 'LOG', 'OUTPUT', 'filetype-1' or <F11> are pressed.

   'filetype-1' switches you to a file with the same file name as your
'.sas' file, but with a different extension ('.txt' by default) and
performs 'refresh'.  You can over-ride the default extension; for
example in your '~/.emacs' or '~/.xemacs/init.el' file:
     (setq ess-sas-suffix-1 "csv") ; for example

   <F9> will prompt you for the name of a permanent SAS dataset near
point to be opened for viewing by 'PROC FSEDIT'.  You can control the SAS
batch command-line with 'ess-sas-data-view-submit-options'.  For
controlling the SAS batch commands, you have the global variables
'ess-sas-data-view-libname' and 'ess-sas-data-view-fsview-command' as
well as the buffer-local variable 'ess-sas-data-view-fsview-statement'.
If you have your SAS 'LIBNAME' defined in '~/autoexec.sas', then the
defaults for these variables should be sufficient.

   Similarly, 'C-<F9>' will prompt you for the name of a permanent SAS
dataset near point to be opened for viewing by 'PROC INSIGHT'.  You can
control the SAS batch command-line with
'ess-sas-data-view-submit-options'.  For controlling the SAS batch
commands, you have the global variables 'ess-sas-data-view-libname' and
'ess-sas-data-view-insight-command' as well as the buffer-local variable
'ess-sas-data-view-insight-statement'.

   <F10> toggles ESS[SAS] mode for '.log' files which is off by default
(technically, it is 'SAS-log-mode', but it looks the same).  The syntax
highlighting can be helpful in certain debugging situations, but large
'.log' files may take a long time to highlight.

   <F11> is the same as 'filetype-1' except it is '.dat' by default.

   <F12> will prompt you for the name of a 'GSASFILE' near the point in
'.log' to be opened for viewing either with emacs or with an external
viewer.  Depending on your version of emacs and the operating system you
are using, emacs may support '.gif' and '.jpg' files internally.  You
may need to change the following variables for your own situation.
'ess-sas-graph-view-suffix-regexp' is a regular expression of supported
file types defined via file name extensions.
'ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-default' is the default external viewer for
your platform.  'ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist' is an alist of
exceptions to the default; i.e.  file types and their associated viewers
which will be used rather than the default viewer.
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-suffix-regexp (concat "[.]\\([eE]?[pP][sS]\\|"
     "[pP][dD][fF]\\|[gG][iI][fF]\\|[jJ][pP][eE]?[gG]\\|"
     "[tT][iI][fF][fF]?\\)")) ;; default
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-default "kodakimg") ;; Windows default
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-default "sdtimage") ;; Solaris default
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist
       '(("[eE]?[pP][sS]" . "gv") ("[pP][dD][fF]" . "gv")) ;; default w/ gv

   'C-<F2>' produces US landscape by default, however, it can produce A4
landscape (first line for "global" key mapping, second for "local"):
     (global-set-key [(control f2)] 'ess-sas-rtf-a4-landscape)
     (define-key sas-mode-local-map [(control f2)] 'ess-sas-rtf-a4-landscape)

13.6 iESS[SAS]-Interactive SAS processes
========================================

Inferior ESS (iESS) is the method for interfacing with interactive
statistical processes (programs).  iESS[SAS] is what is needed for
interactive SAS programming.  iESS[SAS] works best with the SAS
command-line option settings '"-stdio -linesize 80 -noovp
-nosyntaxcheck"' (the default of 'inferior-SAS-args').

     '-stdio'
                 required to make the redirection of stdio work
     '-linesize 80'
                 keeps output lines from folding on standard terminals
     '-noovp'
                 prevents error messages from printing 3 times
     '-nosyntaxcheck'
                 permits recovery after syntax errors

   To start up iESS[SAS] mode, use:
        M-x SAS

   The '*SAS:1.log*' buffer in 'ESStr' mode corresponds to the file
'FOO.log' in SAS batch usage and to the 'SAS: LOG' window in the SAS
Display Manager.  All commands submitted to SAS, informative messages,
warnings, and errors appear here.

   The '*SAS:1.lst*' buffer in 'ESSlst' mode corresponds to the file
'FOO.lst' in SAS batch usage and to the 'SAS: OUTPUT' window in the SAS
Display Manager.  All printed output appears in this window.

   The '*SAS:1*' buffer exists solely as a communications buffer.  The
user should never use this buffer directly.  Files are edited in the
'FOO.sas' buffer.  The 'C-c C-r' key in ESS[SAS] is the functional
equivalent of bringing a file into the 'SAS: PROGRAM EDITOR' window
followed by 'SUBMIT'.

   For example, open the file you want to work with.
     C-x C-f foo.sas
   'FOO.sas' will be in ESS[SAS] mode.  Edit as appropriate, and then
start up SAS with the cursor in the 'FOO.sas' buffer.
     M-x SAS
   Four buffers will appear on screen:
Buffer         Mode              Description
'FOO.sas'      'ESS[SAS]'        your source file
'*SAS:1*'      'iESS[SAS:1]'     iESS communication buffer
'*SAS:1.log*'  'Shell ESStr      SAS log information
               []'
'*SAS:1.lst*'  'Shell ESSlst     SAS listing information
               []'
   If you would prefer each of the four buffers to appear in its own
individual frame, you can arrange for that.  Place the cursor in the
buffer displaying 'FOO.sas'.  Enter the sequence 'C-c C-w'.  The cursor
will normally be in buffer 'FOO.sas'.  If not, put it there and
'C-x b FOO.sas'.

   Send regions, lines, or the entire file contents to SAS (regions are
most useful: a highlighted region will normally begin with the keywords
'DATA' or 'PROC' and end with 'RUN;'), 'C-c C-r'.

   Information appears in the log buffer, analysis results in the
listing buffer.  In case of errors, make the corrections in the
'FOO.sas' buffer and resubmit with another 'C-c C-r'.

   At the end of the session you may save the log and listing buffers
with the usual 'C-x C-s' commands.  You will be prompted for a file
name.  Typically, the names 'FOO.log' and 'FOO.lst' will be used.  You
will almost certainly want to edit the saved files before including them
in a report.  The files are read-only by default.  You can make them
writable by the emacs command 'C-x C-q'.

   At the end of the session, the input file 'FOO.sas' will typically
have been revised.  You can save it.  It can be used later as the
beginning of another iESS[SAS] session.  It can also be used as a batch
input file to SAS.

   The '*SAS:1*' buffer is strictly for ESS use.  The user should never
need to read it or write to it.  Refer to the '.lst' and '.log' buffers
for monitoring output!

   Troubleshooting: *Note iESS(SAS)--Common problems::.

13.7 iESS[SAS]-Common problems
==============================

  1. iESS[SAS] does not work on Windows.  In order to run SAS inside an
     emacs buffer, it is necessary to start SAS with the '-stdio'
     option.  SAS does not support the '-stdio' option on Windows.
  2. If 'M-x SAS' gives errors upon startup, check the following:
        * you are running Windows: see 1.
        * 'ess-sas-sh-command' (from the ESS 'etc' directory) needs to
          be executable; too check, type 'M-x dired'; if not, fix it as
          follows, type 'M-:', then at the minibuffer prompt 'Eval:',
          type '(set-file-modes "ess-sas-sh-command" 493)'.
        * 'sas' isn't in your executable path; to verify, type 'M-:' and
          at the minibuffer prompt 'Eval:', type '(executable-find
          "sas")'
  3. 'M-x SAS' starts SAS Display Manager.  Probably, the command 'sas'
     on your system calls a shell script.  In that case you will need to
     locate the real 'sas' executable and link to it.  You can execute
     the UNIX command:
          find / -name sas -print
     Now place a soft link to the real 'sas' executable in your '~/bin'
     directory, with for example
          cd ~/bin
          ln -s /usr/local/sas9/sas sas
   Check your 'PATH' environment variable to confirm that '~/bin'
appears before the directory in which the 'sas' shell script appears.

13.8 ESS[SAS]-Graphics
======================

Output from a SAS/GRAPH 'PROC' can be displayed in a SAS/GRAPH window
for SAS batch on Windows or for both SAS batch and interactive with
XWindows on UNIX.  If you need to create graphics files and view them
with <F12>, then include the following (either in 'FOO.sas' or in
'~/autoexec.sas'):
     filename gsasfile 'graphics.ps';
     goptions device=ps gsfname=gsasfile gsfmode=append;
   'PROC PLOT' graphs can be viewed in the listing buffer.  You may wish
to control the vertical spacing to allow the entire plot to be visible
on screen, for example:
     proc plot;
         plot a*b / vpos=25;
     run;

13.9 ESS[SAS]-Windows
=====================

   * iESS[SAS] does not work on Windows.  *Note iESS(SAS)--Common
     problems::.

   * ESS[SAS] mode for editing SAS language files works very well.
     *Note ESS(SAS)--Editing files::.

   * There are two execution options for SAS on Windows.  You can use
     batch.  *Note ESS(SAS)--Batch SAS processes::.

     Or you can mark regions with the mouse and submit the code with
     'submit-region' or paste them into SAS Display Manager.

ESS[BUGS] was originally designed for use with BUGS software.  Later, it
evolved to support JAGS as a dialect of the BUGS language via ESS[JAGS],
however, ESS[JAGS] is documented in the section Help for JAGS. ESS[BUGS]
provides 5 features.  First, BUGS syntax is described to allow for
proper fontification of statements, distributions, functions, commands
and comments in BUGS model files, command files and log files.  Second,
ESS creates templates for the command file from the model file so that a
BUGS batch process can be defined by a single file.  Third, ESS provides
a BUGS batch script that allows ESS to set BUGS batch parameters.
Fourth, key sequences are defined to create a command file and submit a
BUGS batch process.  Lastly, interactive submission of BUGS commands is
also supported.

14.1 ESS[BUGS]-Model files
==========================

Model files with the '.bug' extension are edited in ESS[BUGS] mode if
'(require 'ess-bugs-d)' was performed.  Model files with the '.jag'
extension are edited in ESS[JAGS] mode if '(require 'ess-jags-d)' was
performed.  Three keys are bound for your use in ESS[BUGS], 'F2', 'C-c
C-c' and '='.  'F2' performs the same action as it does in ESS[SAS],
*Note ESS(SAS)--Function keys for batch processing::.  'C-c C-c'
performs the function 'ess-bugs-next-action' which you will use a lot.
Pressing it in an empty buffer for a model file will produce a template
for you.  '=' inserts the set operator, '<-'.

14.2 ESS[BUGS]-Command files
============================

To avoid extension name collision, '.bmd' is used for BUGS command files
and '.jmd' for JAGS command files.  When you have finished editing your
model file and press 'C-c C-c', a command file is created if one does
not already exist.  When you are finished editing your command file,
pressing 'C-c C-c' again will submit your command file as a batch job.

14.3 ESS[BUGS]-Log files
========================

To avoid extension name collision, '.bog' is used for BUGS log files.
The command line generated by ESS creates the '.bog' transcript file.
Similarly, '.jog' is used for JAGS log files.

ESS[BUGS] was originally designed for use with BUGS software.  Later, it
evolved to support JAGS as a dialect of the BUGS language via ESS[JAGS].
Since BUGS and JAGS are quite similar, ESS[BUGS] and ESS[JAGS] are
necessarily similar.  ESS[JAGS] provides 4 features.  First, JAGS syntax
is described to allow for proper fontification of statements,

15.1 ESS[JAGS]-Model files
==========================

Model files with the '.bug' extension are edited in ESS[BUGS] mode if
'(require 'ess-bugs-d)' was performed or edited in ESS[JAGS] mode if
'(require 'ess-jags-d)'.  Three keys are bound for your use in
ESS[BUGS], 'F2', 'C-c C-c' and '='.  'F2' performs the same action as it
does in ESS[SAS], *Note ESS(SAS)--Function keys for batch processing::.
'C-c C-c' performs the function 'ess-bugs-next-action' which you will
use a lot.  Pressing it in an empty buffer for a model file will produce
a template for you.  '=' inserts the set operator, '<-'.

   ESS[JAGS] does not support "replacement" variables which were part of
ESS[BUGS].  Although, "replacement" variables are an extremely
convenient feature, creating the elisp code for their operation was
challenging.  So, a more elisp-ish approach was adopted for ESS[JAGS]:
elisp local variables.  These variables are created as part of the
template, i.e.  with the first press of 'C-c C-c' in an empty buffer.
For your '.bug' file, they are named 'ess-jags-chains',
'ess-jags-monitor', 'ess-jags-thin', 'ess-jags-burnin' and
'ess-jags-update'; they appear in the 'Local Variables' section.  When
you are finished editing your model file, pressing 'C-c C-c' will
perform the necessary actions to build your command file for you.

   The 'ess-jags-chains' variable is the number of chains that you want
to initialize and sample from; defaults to 1.  The 'ess-jags-monitor'
variable is a list of variables that you want monitored: encase each
variable in double quotes.  When you press 'C-c C-c', the appropriate
statements are created in the command file to monitor the list of
variables.  By default, no variables are explicitly monitored which
means JAGS will implicitly monitor all "default" variables.  The
'ess-jags-thin' variable is the thinning parameter.  By default, the
thinning parameter is set to 1, i.e.  no thinning.  The
'ess-jags-burnin' variable is the number of initial samples to discard.
By default, the burnin parameter is set to 10000.  The 'ess-jags-update'
variable is the number of post-burnin samples to keep.  By default, the
update parameter is set to 10000.  Both 'ess-jags-burnin' and
'ess-jags-update' are multiplied by 'ess-jags-thin' since JAGS does not
do it automatically.

15.2 ESS[JAGS]-Command files
============================

To avoid extension name collision, '.bmd' is used for BUGS command files
and '.jmd' for JAGS command files.  For your '.jmd' file, there is only
one variable, 'ess-jags-command', in the 'Local Variables' section.
When you have finished editing your model file and press 'C-c C-c', a
command file is created if one does not already exist.  When you are
finished editing your command file, pressing 'C-c C-c' again will submit
your command file as a batch job.  The 'ess-jags-command' variable
allows you to specify a different JAGS program to use to run your model;
defaults to "jags".

useful to refresh the '.jog' if the batch process over-writes or appends
it.

16.1 Bugs
=========

   * Commands like 'ess-display-help-on-object' and list completion
     cannot be used while the user is entering a multi-line command.
     The only real fix in this situation is to use another ESS process.

   * The 'ess-eval-' commands can leave point in the ESS process buffer
     in the wrong place when point is at the same position as the last
     process output.  This proves difficult to fix, in general, as we
     need to consider all _windows_ with 'window-point' at the right
     place.

   * It's possible to clear the modification flag (say, by saving the
     buffer) with the edit buffer not having been loaded into S.

   * Backup files can sometimes be left behind, even when
     'ess-keep-dump-files' is 'nil'.

   * Passing an incomplete S expression to 'ess-execute' causes ESS to
     hang.

   * The function-based commands don't always work as expected on
     functions whose body is not a parenthesized or compound expression,
     and don't even recognize anonymous functions (i.e.  functions not
     assigned to any variable).

   * Multi-line commands could be handled better by the command history
     mechanism.

   * Changes to the continutation prompt in R (e.g.  'options(continue =
     " ")') are not automatically detected by ESS. Hence, for now, the
     best thing is not to change the continuation prompt.  If you do
     change the continuation prompt, you will need to change accordingly
     the value of 'inferior-ess-secondary-prompt' in
     'R-customize-alist'.

16.2 Reporting Bugs
===================

Please send bug reports, suggestions etc.  to
<ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch>

   The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing

   'M-x ess-submit-bug-report'

   This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

   If Emacs reports an error, backtraces can help us debug the problem.
Type "M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET". Then run the
command that causes the error and you should see a *Backtrace* buffer
containing debug information; send us that buffer.

   Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.

16.3 Mailing Lists
==================

There is a mailing list for discussions and announcements relating to
ESS. Join the list by sending an e-mail with "subscribe ess-help" (or
"help") in the body to <ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch>;
contributions to the list may be mailed to <ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch>.
Rest assured, this is a fairly low-volume mailing list.

   The purposes of the mailing list include

   * helping users of ESS to get along with it.
   * discussing aspects of using ESS on Emacs and XEmacs.
   * suggestions for improvements.
   * announcements of new releases of ESS.
   * posting small patches to ESS.

16.4 Help with emacs
====================

Emacs is a complex editor with many abilities that we do not have space
to describe here.  If you have problems with other features of emacs
(e.g.  printing), there are several sources to consult, including the
emacs FAQs (try 'M-x xemacs-www-faq' or 'M-x view-emacs-FAQ') and
EmacsWiki (<http://www.emacswiki.org>).  Please consult them before
asking on the mailing list about issues that are not specific to ESS.

Appendix A Customizing ESS
**************************

ESS can be easily customized to your taste simply by including the
appropriate lines in your '.emacs' file.  There are numerous variables
which affect the behavior of ESS in certain situations which can be
modified to your liking.  Keybindings may be set or changed to your
preferences, and for per-buffer customizations hooks are also available.

   Most of these variables can be viewed and set using the Custom
facility within Emacs.  Type 'M-x customize-group RET ess RET' to see
all the ESS variables that can be customized.  Variables are grouped by
subject to make it easy to find related variables.
