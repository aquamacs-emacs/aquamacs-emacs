(defvar aquamacs-version "3.5"
"A string with Aquamacs' version number.
The format of the string is undefined.
For a reliable numerical representation, use `aquamacs-version-id'.")

(defvar aquamacs-version-id 350.1
  "A float indicating Aquamacs' version number.
Full integers correspond to the third position of the public
version number, e.g. version 0.9.7 is represented as `97.x'.
Minor version numbers are reflected in the decimals.
It is guaranteed that for any two Aquamacs releases A and B,
if aquamacs-version-id for B is higher than aquamacs-version-id
for A, then B is newer than A.")

Changes in this code are ignored during the online version check.")
