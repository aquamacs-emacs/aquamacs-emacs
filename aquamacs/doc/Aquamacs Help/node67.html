</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Based on GNU Emacs 22.1.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Java support has just gotten a lot better. JDEE is a complete,
        integrated development environment for Java in Emacs. It supports
        building, source-level debugging, code generation and much
        more. Aquamacs now contains the latest version of JDEE, configured
        to work with the Java SDK installed via Apple's Developer
        Tools. Visit <kbd><A ID="tex2html66"
  HREF="http://jdee.sunsite.dk">http://jdee.sunsite.dk</A></kbd> for more information.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Toolbar: The icons have been completely redesigned. The colors
        make them easy to distinguish.  The functions available from the
        standard toolbar have been carefully selected.
        Using the Options - Show/Hide - Toolbar items menu,
        icons may be shown or hidden to fit the user's needs.

<P>
Available functions:
        
<UL>
<LI>New, open, save/save as, revert buffer
</LI>
<LI>Undo, redo
</LI>
<LI>Cut/copy/paste
</LI>
<LI>Find (isearch)
</LI>
<LI>Spell-check buffer (ispell-buffer)
</LI>
<LI>Print
</LI>
<LI>Make a new frame
</LI>
<LI>Preferences
</LI>
<LI>Help
        
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
We'd like to acknowledge the artists:
        
<UL>
<LI>Preferences, Revert Buffer, Kill Buffer: Jasper Hauser
</LI>
<LI>New Frame, Recent Files, Spell-check: Nuovext Project
</LI>
<LI>all other icons: Adrian Chromenko and David Reitter
         
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Spell-Checking can now be found in the Edit menu, not in
        Tools. The "Check As You Type" function (flyspell-mode) will
        automatically check the buffer contents (unless it's a big buffer)
        when first enabled.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Spell-Checking now supports the popular cocoAspell package,
        which includes English language dictionaries and the GNU Aspell
        spell-checking library. Additional dictionaries may be installed.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Formatting (filling) text with M-q (Option-q) is a bit more
        convenient now: when a region is selected, the command applies to
        the whole region and not just to a paragraph.
        We also provide M-Q (Option-Shift-q) to "unfill" a paragraph or a
        region, which comes in handy when wrapped text needs to be
        converted to soft-wrapped text, or to copy&amp;paste it into other applications.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>one-buffer-one-frame-mode is more compatible to the normal Emacs
        paradigm of one-frame-many-buffers for internal technical
        reasons, but also with respect to whether newly opened frames
        (windows) are actually selected and receive the following user
        inputs. In many situations, classical Emacs shows a buffer in an
        extra window, but doesn't select it - so the user can keep
        working on the original document. Aquamacs will now do the same -
        it will raise the appropriate frame, but not select it. If you
        would like to make it select at all newly opened frames, use this
        in your Preferences.el:

<P>
(setq display-buffer-reuse-frames 'select)

<P>
Also (the technical change): Function `switch-to-buffer' will set
        the current buffer immediately without waiting for the next
        top-level event loop.)  Thanks to Lowell Vaughn for pointing out a
        seemingly unimportant bug in one of Emacs' on-board games, which
        led to the discovery of this issue.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Undo as in the original Emacs is available again via
        `undo'. Apple-Z and Apple-Shift-Z are bound to Aquamacs
        undo/redo functions (now called `aquamacs-undo/redo' as they
        used to be, but seasoned Emacs users may now use
        Control-underscore to access the classical undo. The
        difference is that the old-school undo will undo it's own undo
        steps.  Suggested by Rudi Schlatte

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Undo (aquamacs-undo, Apple-Z) will now restore point and mark as
        appropriate.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Left/Right keys will now behave more Mac-like, whenever text is         marked (i.e. the mark is active / text has been selected). They now         move to the beginning or the end of that region, respectively. To turn off this behavior, turn off CUA mode or rebind  left/right keys in osx-key-low-priority-key-map by adding this to your Preferences.el or .emacs file:
]
(define-key osx-key-low-priority-key-map [left] 'backward-char)

<P>
(define-key osx-key-low-priority-key-map [right] 'forward-char)

<P>
(osx-key-mode 1)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Apple-2 can now be used to split the window into two (like C-x
        2), Apple-1 will undo that split (like C-x 1).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Cut/Copy/Paste with the secondary selection (use Option + mouse)
        are now bound to Option-Apple-X, Option-Apple-C,
        respectively (unless Option is not Meta, in which case you'd use
        ESC Apple C, or whatever M-A-c is for you.)  (This is to avoid
        problems in cases when Caps Lock is on, which is recognized as
        Shift modifier.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The current major mode may be changed in the context menu

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Emulate-Mac-German|Italian|...-Keyboard-Modes now allow you to
        call the commands bound to the original Meta key combinations
        using the "Esc" key. For example, in the German keyboard
        emulation, pressing Option-l will give you @, while Esc l will do
        `downcase-word'.
        Also, this mode now supports searching (Apple-F) with `isearch'.
        Reported by Thomas Käufl.	Additionally, an emulation mode for the Finnish keyboard layout is available now. Patch by Lauri Raittila.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Default colors in help and *Messages* frames/buffers revised.
        Suggested by Charles Bailey

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Recently opened files that were opened from the "Recent Files"
        menu, or from an external shell with the 'open' command or
        something similar are now available in the minibuffer history that
        one gets with C-x C-f `up'.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Clicking into raised frames (windows) that are not the selected
        frame (i.e. have grey instead of red-yellow-green buttons) will
        now activate that frame.
        Patch by Yamamoto Mitsuharu

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Creator codes for loaded files are maintained and not always
        reset to the Aquamacs / Emacs code. This way, users may use the
        Finder to open specific files with another application by default,
        but still edit the file in Aquamacs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Updated AUCTeX (11.84). [M-x latex-mode].
        XeTeX users: please customize `TeX-command-list' to call XeTeX
        directly.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Haskell mode included (2.3). [M-x haskell-mode]

<P>
</LI>
<LI>RubyOnRails support via emacs-rails included (0.5.3)
                                        [M-x rails-minor-mode, with M-x ruby-mode]

<P>
</LI>
<LI>ACT-R support. [M-x actr-mode]

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Menu Bar fixes. (Disabled menu bar entries when frames invisible.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs menu name shortened.
        Suggested by Enrico Franconi

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Accessibility in OS X fixes (simulated clicks on Window elements)
        Suggested by Alexis Gallagher
        Patch by Yamamoto Mitsuharu

<P>
</LI>
<LI>HTML files (and others) can be opened in the system's default
        browser again. This applies to C-c C-z v in html-helper-mode and
        other modes using `browse-url'.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tramp files (i.e. remote files loaded with
        /uid@host:/path/to/file syntax) are noted in the "recent files"
        history list and not discarded any longer when Aquamacs is
        restarted.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>1.0a: Some documentation of Emacs functions (C-h f setq RET, e.g.) was not available on PPC Macs.
  Reported by David Sagan and Bill Rising.
</LI>
<LI>1.0a: Some additional executables like movemail did not work on PPC Macs.
Reported by Barbara Shirtcliff.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>1.0b: Ruby-mode included in new-buffer/change major mode menu

<P>
</LI>
<LI>1.0b: The underlying source code is now fixed to be GNU Emacs 22.1 plus Aquamacs extensions.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>1.0b: On older PPC Macs, text input was only updated slowly whenever the tool bar (icons at the top of the frame) was turned on.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>1.0b: Gnus did not work correctly. Reported by Martin Jørgensen.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>1.0b: M-x tile-frames-horizontally/vertically fixed. Patch by Ben Hyde. Updated to new `oneonone' library version, code by Drew Adams.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>1.0b: Moving the point left or right with the arrow keys could cause an error message &ldquo;Mark inactive&rdquo; to appear in certain circumstances. Reported by Michel Charpentier.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Thanks for supplying build machines: Toby Blake (U Edinburgh),
        James Pringle (U New Hampshire) and Carlo Gandolfi (Milan).
