<p><a name="index-mail_002dcitation_002dhook-130"></a><a name="index-g_t_002eemacs-file-131"></a>In most cases, all that is necessary to begin using Supercite is to add
the following to <samp><span class="file">~.emacs</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'mail-citation-hook 'sc-cite-original)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For more details of the process, read on<small class="dots">...</small>

   <p>Hitting <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd> in your MUA's reply buffer yanks and cites the
original message into the reply buffer.  In reality, the citation of the
original message is performed via a call through a configurable hook
variable.  The name of this variable has been agreed to in advance as
part of the <dfn>citation interface specification</dfn>.  By default this
hook variable has a <code>nil</code> value, which the MUA recognizes to mean,
&ldquo;use your default citation function.&rdquo;  When you add Supercite's
citation function to the hook, thereby giving the variable a
non-<code>nil</code> value, it tells the MUA to run the hook via
<code>run-hooks</code> instead of using the default citation.

   <p>Early in Supercite's development, the Supercite author, a few MUA
authors, and some early Supercite users got together and agreed upon a
standard interface between MUAs and citation packages (of which
Supercite is currently the only known add-on <tt>:-)</tt>.  Supercite can
probably be used with most Emacs MUAs, with a greater or lesser degree
of effort.

   <p>To learn exactly how to connect Supercite to the software systems you
are using, read the appropriate following sections.  For details on the
interface specifications, or if you are writing or maintaining an MUA,
see <a href="Hints-to-MUA-Authors.html#Hints-to-MUA-Authors">Hints to MUA Authors</a>.

   <p><a name="index-autoload-132"></a><a name="index-g_t_002eemacs-file-133"></a><a name="index-sc_002dcite_002doriginal-134"></a><a name="index-cite_002doriginal-_0028sc_002d_0029-135"></a><a name="index-sc_002dsubmit_002dbug_002dreport-136"></a><a name="index-submit_002dbug_002dreport-_0028sc_002d_0029-137"></a>The first thing that everyone should do, regardless of the MUA you are
using is to set up Emacs so it will load Supercite at the appropriate
time.  This happens automatically if Supercite is distributed with your
Emacs version.  If not, you can set up an <dfn>autoload</dfn> for Supercite.

   <p>To do the latter, put the following in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     (autoload 'sc-cite-original "supercite" nil t)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-point-138"></a><a name="index-mark-139"></a>The function <code>sc-cite-original</code> is the top-level Supercite function
designed to be run from the citation hook.  It expects
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">point</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mark</span></samp>&rsquo; to be set around the region to cite, and it
expects the original article's mail headers to be present within this
region.  Note that Supercite <em>never</em> touches any text outside this
region.  Note further that the region need not be active
for <code>sc-cite-original</code> to do its job. 
See <a href="Hints-to-MUA-Authors.html#Hints-to-MUA-Authors">Hints to MUA Authors</a>.

   <p>The other step in the getting connected process is to make sure your
MUA calls <code>sc-cite-original</code> at the right time.  As mentioned
above, some MUAs handle this differently.  Read the sections that follow
pertaining to the MUAs you are using.

   <p><a name="index-sc_002dload_002dhook-140"></a><a name="index-load_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-141"></a><a name="index-sc_002dpre_002dhook-142"></a><a name="index-pre_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-143"></a>One final note.  After Supercite is loaded into your Emacs session, it
runs the hook <code>sc-load-hook</code>.  You can put any customizations into
this hook since it is only run once.  This will not work, however, if
your Emacs maintainer has put Supercite into your dumped Emacs' image. 
In that case, you can use the <code>sc-pre-hook</code> variable, but this will
get executed every time <code>sc-cite-original</code> is called.  See <a href="Reply-Buffer-Initialization.html#Reply-Buffer-Initialization">Reply Buffer Initialization</a>.
