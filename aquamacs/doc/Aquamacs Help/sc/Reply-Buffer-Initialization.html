<h3 class="section">6.1 Reply Buffer Initialization</h3>

<p>Executing <code>sc-cite-original</code> performs the following steps as it
initializes the reply buffer:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><a name="index-sc_002dpre_002dhook-146"></a><a name="index-pre_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-147"></a><em>Runs </em><code>sc-pre-hook</code><em>.</em>
This hook variable is run before <code>sc-cite-original</code> does any other
work.  You could conceivably use this hook to set certain Supercite
variables based on the reply buffer's mode or name (i.e., to do
something different based on whether you are replying or following up to
an article).

     <li><em>Inserts Supercite's keymap.</em>
<a name="index-sc_002dmode_002dmap_002dprefix-148"></a><a name="index-mode_002dmap_002dprefix-_0028sc_002d_0029-149"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dp-150"></a><a name="index-keymap-prefix-151"></a>Supercite provides a number of commands for performing post-yank
modifications to the reply buffer.  These commands are installed on
Supercite's top-level keymap.  Since Supercite has to interface with a
wide variety of MUAs, it does not install all of its commands directly
into the reply buffer's keymap.  Instead, it puts its commands on a
keymap prefix, then installs this prefix onto the buffer's keymap.  What
this means is that you typically have to type more characters to invoke
a Supercite command, but Supercite's key bindings can be made much more
consistent across MUAs.

     <p>You can control what key Supercite uses as its keymap prefix by changing
the variable <code>sc-mode-map-prefix</code>.  By default, this variable is
set to <code>C-c C-p</code>; a finger twister perhaps, but unfortunately the
best default due to the scarcity of available key bindings in many MUAs.

     <li><em>Turns on Supercite minor mode.</em>
<a name="index-modeline-152"></a>The modeline of the reply buffer should indicate that Supercite is
active in that buffer by displaying the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SC</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li><em>Sets the &ldquo;Undo Boundary.&rdquo;</em>
<a name="index-undo-boundary-153"></a>Supercite sets an undo boundary before it begins to modify the original
yanked text.  This allows you to easily undo Supercite's changes to
affect alternative citing styles.

     <li><em>Processes the mail headers.</em>
<a name="index-sc_002dconfirm_002dalways_002dp-154"></a><a name="index-confirm_002dalways_002dp-_0028sc_002d_0029-155"></a><a name="index-sc_002dmail_002dwarn_002dif_002dnon_002drfc822_002dp-156"></a><a name="index-mail_002dwarn_002dif_002dnon_002drfc822_002dp-_0028sc_002d_0029-157"></a>All previously retrieved info key-value pairs are deleted from the info
alist, then the mail headers in the body of the yanked message are
scanned. Info key-value pairs are created for each header found. Also,
such useful information as the author's name and email address are
extracted.  If the variable <code>sc-mail-warn-if-non-rfc822-p</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, then Supercite will warn you if it finds a mail header
that does not conform to RFC822.  This is rare and indicates a problem
either with your MUA or the original author's MUA, or some MTA (mail
transport agent) along the way.

     <p><a name="index-sc_002dnuke_002dmail_002dheaders-158"></a><a name="index-sc_002dnuke_002dmail_002dheader_002dlist-159"></a><a name="index-nuke_002dmail_002dheaders-_0028sc_002d_0029-160"></a><a name="index-nuke_002dmail_002dheader_002dlist-_0028sc_002d_0029-161"></a>Once the info keys have been extracted from the mail headers, the
headers are nuked from the reply buffer.  You can control exactly which
headers are removed or kept, but by default, all headers are removed.

     <p>There are two variables which control mail header nuking.  The variable
<code>sc-nuke-mail-headers</code> controls the overall behavior of the header
nuking routines.  By setting this variable to <code>'all</code>, you
automatically nuke all mail headers.  Likewise, setting this variable to
<code>'none</code> inhibits nuking of any mail headers.  In between these
extremes, you can tell Supercite to nuke only a specified list of mail
headers by setting this variable to <code>'specified</code>, or to keep only a
specified list of headers by setting it to <code>'keep</code>.

     <p>If <code>sc-nuke-mail-headers</code> is set to <code>'specified</code> or
<code>'keep</code>, then the variable <code>sc-nuke-mail-header-list</code> is
consulted for the list of headers to nuke or keep.  This variable
contains a list of regular expressions.  If the mail header line matches
a regular expression in this list, the header will be nuked or kept. 
The line is matched against the regexp using <code>looking-at</code> rooted at
the beginning of the line.

     <p><a name="index-sc_002dblank_002dlines_002dafter_002dheaders-162"></a><a name="index-blank_002dlines_002dafter_002dheaders-_0028sc_002d_0029-163"></a>If the variable <code>sc-blank-lines-after-headers</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
it contains the number of blank lines remaining in the buffer after mail
headers are nuked.  By default, only one blank line is left in the buffer.

     <li><em>Selects the attribution and citation strings.</em>
Once the mail headers have been processed, Supercite selects a
attribution string and a citation string which it will use to cite the
original message.  See <a href="Selecting-an-Attribution.html#Selecting-an-Attribution">Selecting an Attribution</a>, for details.

     <li><em>Cites the message body.</em>
<a name="index-sc_002dcite_002dregion_002dlimit-164"></a><a name="index-cite_002dregion_002dlimit-_0028sc_002d_0029b-165"></a>After the selection of the attribution and citation strings, Supercite
cites the original message by inserting the citation string prefix in
front of every uncited line.  You may not want Supercite to
automatically cite very long messages however.  For example, some email
could contain a smaller header section followed by a huge uuencoded
message.  It wouldn't make sense to cite the uuencoded message part when
responding to the original author's short preface.  For this reason,
Supercite provides a variable which limits the automatic citation of
long messages to a certain maximum number of lines.  The variable is
called <code>sc-cite-region-limit</code>.  If this variable contains an
integer, messages with more lines that this will not be cited at all,
and a warning message will be displayed.  Supercite has performed
everything necessary, though, for you to manually cite only the small
portion of the original message that you want to use.

     <p>If <code>sc-cite-region-limit</code> contains a non-<code>nil</code> value, the
original message will always be cited, regardless of its size.  If the
variable contains the value <code>nil</code>, the region will never be cited
automatically.  Use this if you always want to be able to edit and cite
the message manually.

     <p><a name="index-sc_002dcite_002dblank_002dlines_002dp-166"></a><a name="index-cite_002dblank_002dlines_002dp-_0028sc_002d_0029-167"></a>The variable <code>sc-cite-blank-lines-p</code> controls whether blank lines
in the original message should be cited or not.  If this variable is
non-<code>nil</code>, blank lines will be cited just like non-blank lines. 
Otherwise, blank lines will be treated as paragraph separators.

     <p>Citing of the original message is highly configurable. Supercite's
default setup does a pretty good job of citing many common forms of
previously cited messages.  But there are as many citation styles out
there as people on the net, or just about!  It would be impossible for
Supercite to anticipate every style in existence, and you probably
wouldn't encounter them all anyway.  But you can configure Supercite to
recognize those styles you see often. 
See <a href="Configuring-the-Citation-Engine.html#Configuring-the-Citation-Engine">Configuring the Citation Engine</a>, for details.

     <li><em>Runs </em><code>sc-post-hook</code><em>.</em>
<a name="index-sc_002dpost_002dhook-168"></a><a name="index-post_002dhook-_0028sc_002d_0029-169"></a>This variable is very similar to <code>sc-pre-hook</code>, except that it runs
after <code>sc-cite-original</code> is finished. This hook is provided mostly
for completeness and backward compatibility. Perhaps it could be used to
reset certain variables set in <code>sc-pre-hook</code>.
