<h2 class="chapter">10 Hints to MUA Authors</h2>

<p>In June of 1989, some discussion was held between the various MUA
authors, the Supercite author, and other Supercite users. These
discussions centered around the need for a standard interface between
MUAs and Supercite (or any future Supercite-like packages).  This
interface was formally proposed by Martin Neitzel on Fri, 23 Jun 89, in
a mail message to the Supercite mailing list:

<pre class="example">             Martin&gt; Each news/mail-reader should provide a form of
             Martin&gt; mail-yank-original that
     
             Martin&gt; 1: inserts the original message incl. header into the
             Martin&gt;    reply buffer; no indentation/prefixing is done, the header
             Martin&gt;    tends to be a "full blown" version rather than to be
             Martin&gt;    stripped down.
     
             Martin&gt; 2: `point' is at the start of the header, `mark' at the
             Martin&gt;    end of the message body.
     
             Martin&gt; 3: (run-hooks 'mail-yank-hooks)
     
             Martin&gt; [Supercite] should be run as such a hook and merely
             Martin&gt; rewrite the message.  This way it isn't anymore
             Martin&gt; [Supercite]'s job to gather the original from obscure
             Martin&gt; sources. [...]
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-mail_002dcitation_002dhook-271"></a><a name="index-mail_002dyank_002dhooks-272"></a><a name="index-sendmail_002eel-273"></a><a name="index-mail_002dyank_002doriginal-274"></a><a name="index-defvar-275"></a>This specification was adopted, but underwent a slight modification with
the release of Emacs 19.  Instead of the variable
<code>mail-yank-hooks</code>, the hook variable that the MUA should provide is
<code>mail-citation-hook</code>.  Richard Stallman suggests that the MUAs
should <code>defvar</code> <code>mail-citation-hook</code> to <code>nil</code> and perform
some default citing when that is the case.

   <p>If you are writing a new MUA package, or maintaining an existing MUA
package, you should make it conform to this interface so that your users
will be able to link Supercite easily and seamlessly. To do this, when
setting up a reply or forward buffer, your MUA should follow these
steps:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Insert the original message, including the mail headers into the reply
buffer. At this point you should not modify the raw text in any way
(except for any necessary decoding, e.g. of quoted-printable text), and
you should place all the original headers into the body of the reply. 
This means that many of the mail headers will be duplicated, one copy
above the <code>mail-header-separator</code> line and one copy below, however
there will probably be more headers below this line.

     <li>Set &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">point</span></samp>&rsquo; to the beginning of the line containing the first mail
header in the body of the reply. Set &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mark</span></samp>&rsquo; at the end of the
message text.  It is very important that the region be set around the
text Supercite is to modify and that the mail headers are within this
region.  Supercite will not venture outside the region for any reason,
and anything within the region is fair game, so don't put anything that
<strong>must</strong> remain unchanged inside the region.

     <li>Run the hook <code>mail-citation-hook</code>. You will probably want to
provide some kind of default citation functions in cases where the user
does not have Supercite installed.  By default, your MUA should
<code>defvar</code> <code>mail-citation-hook</code> to <code>nil</code>, and in your
yanking function, check its value.  If it finds
<code>mail-citation-hook</code> to be <code>nil</code>, it should perform some
default citing behavior.  User who want to connect to Supercite then
need only add <code>sc-cite-original</code> to this list of hooks using
<code>add-hook</code>.
        </ol>

   <p>If you do all this your MUA will join the ranks of those that conform to
this interface &ldquo;out of the box.&rdquo;
