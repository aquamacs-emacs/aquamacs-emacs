<h3 class="section">7.1 Attribution Preferences</h3>

<p>When you cite an original message, you can tell Supercite which part of
the author's name you would prefer it to use as the attribution.  The
variable <code>sc-preferred-attribution-list</code> controls this; it contains
keys which are matched against the attribution alist in the given order. 
The first value of a key that produces a non-<code>nil</code>, non-empty
string match is used as the attribution string, and if no keys match, a
secondary mechanism is used to generate the attribution. 
See <a href="Anonymous-Attributions.html#Anonymous-Attributions">Anonymous Attributions</a>.

   <p>The following preferences are always available in the attribution alist
(barring error):

     <dl>
<dt><code>"emailname"</code><dd>the author's email terminus.

     <br><dt><code>"initials"</code><dd>the author's initials.

     <br><dt><code>"firstname"</code><dd>the author's first name.

     <br><dt><code>"lastname"</code><dd>the author's last name.

     <br><dt><code>"middlename-1"</code><dd>the author's first middle name.

     <br><dt><code>"sc-lastchoice"</code><dd>the last attribution string you have selected. This is useful when you
recite paragraphs in the reply.

     <br><dt><code>"sc-consult"</code><dd><a name="index-sc_002dattrib_002dselection_002dlist-186"></a><a name="index-attrib_002dselection_002dlist-_0028sc_002d_0029-187"></a>consults the customizable list <code>sc-attrib-selection-list</code> which can
be used to select special attributions based on the value of any info
key.  See below for details.

     <br><dt><code>"x-attribution"</code><dd>the original author's suggestion for attribution string choice. See below
for details. 
</dl>

   <p>Middle name indexes can be any positive integer greater than zero,
though it is unlikely that many authors will have more than one middle
name, if that many.

   <p>At this point, let me digress into a discussion of etiquette.  It is my
belief that while the style of the citations is a reflection of the
personal tastes of the replier (i.e., you), the attribution selection is
ultimately the personal choice of the original author.  In a sense it is
his or her &ldquo;net nickname&rdquo;, and therefore the author should have some
say in the selection of attribution string.  Imagine how you would feel
if someone gave you a nickname that you didn't like?

   <p>For this reason, Supercite recognizes a special mail header,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X-Attribution:</span></samp>&rsquo;, which if present, tells Supercite the attribution
string preferred by the original author.  It is the value of this header
that is associated with the <code>"x-attribution"</code> key in the
attribution alist.  Currently, you can override the preference of this
key by changing <code>sc-preferred-attribution-list</code>, but that isn't
polite, and in the future Supercite may hard-code this.  For now, it is
suggested that if you change the order of the keys in this list, that
<code>"x-attribution"</code> always be first, or possible second behind only
<code>"sc-lastchoice"</code>.  This latter is the default.

   <p><a name="index-sc_002dattrib_002dselection_002dlist-188"></a><a name="index-attrib_002dselection_002dlist-_0028sc_002d_0029-189"></a>The value <code>"sc-consult"</code> in <code>sc-preferred-attribution-list</code>
has a special meaning during attribution selection.  When Supercite
encounters this preference, it begins processing a customizable list of
attributions, contained in the variable <code>sc-attrib-selection-list</code>. 
Each element in this list contains lists of the following form:

<pre class="example">     (<var>infokey</var> ((<var>regexp</var> . <var>attribution</var>)
              (<var>regexp</var> . <var>attribution</var>)
              (...)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-sc_002dmail_002dfield-190"></a><a name="index-mail_002dfield-_0028sc_002d_0029-191"></a>where <var>infokey</var> is a key for <code>sc-mail-field</code> and <var>regexp</var>
is a regular expression to match against the <var>infokey</var>'s value. If
<var>regexp</var> matches the <var>infokey</var>'s value, the <var>attribution</var> is
used as the attribution string.  Actually, <var>attribution</var> can be a
string or a list; if it is a list, it is <code>eval</code>uated and the return
value (which must be a string), is used as the attribution.

   <p>This can be very useful for when you are replying to net acquaintances
who do not use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X-Attribution:</span></samp>&rsquo; mail header.  You may know
what nickname they would prefer to use, and you can set up this list to
match against a specific mail field, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">From:</span></samp>&rsquo;, allowing you
to cite your friend's message with the appropriate attribution.
