<h3 class="section">9.4 Mail Field Commands</h3>

<p>These commands allow you to view, modify, add, and delete various bits
of information from the info alist. 
See <a href="Information-Keys-and-the-Info-Alist.html#Information-Keys-and-the-Info-Alist">Information Keys and the Info Alist</a>.

<dl><dt><code>sc-mail-field-query</code> (<kbd>C-c C-p f</kbd>)<dd>Allows you to interactively view, modify, add, and delete info alist
key-value pairs.  With no argument, you are prompted (with completion)
for a info key.  The value associated with that key is displayed in the
minibuffer.  With an argument, this command will first ask if you want
to view, modify, add, or delete an info key. Viewing is identical to
running the command with no arguments.

     <p>If you want to modify the value of a key, Supercite will first prompt
you (with completion) for the key of the value you want to change.  It
will then put you in the minibuffer with the key's current value so you
can edit the value as you wish.  When you hit &lt;RET&gt;, the key's value
is changed.  Minibuffer history is kept for the values.

     <p>If you choose to delete a key-value pair, Supercite will prompt you (with
completion) for the key to delete.

     <p>If you choose to add a new key-value pair, Supercite firsts prompts you
for the key to add.  Note that completion is turned on for this prompt,
but you can type any key name here, even one that does not yet exist. 
After entering the key, Supercite prompts you for the key's value.  It
is not an error to enter a key that already exists, but the new value
will override any old value.  It will not replace it though; if you
subsequently delete the key-value pair, the old value will reappear.

of mail headers in the region between &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">point</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mark</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
This function is especially useful for replying to digest messages where
Supercite will initially set up its information for the digest
originator, but you want to cite each component article with the real
message author.  Note that unless an error during processing occurs, any
old information is lost.
