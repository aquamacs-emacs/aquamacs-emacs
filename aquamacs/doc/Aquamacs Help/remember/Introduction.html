<h2 class="chapter">2 Introduction</h2>

<p>Todo lists, schedules, phone databases... everything we use databases
for is really just a way to extend the power of our memory, to be able
to remember what our conscious mind may not currently have access to.

   <p>There are many different databases out there&mdash;and good ones&mdash;which
this mode is not trying to replace.  Rather, it's how that data gets
there that's the question.  Most of the time, we just want to say
"Remember so-and-so's phone number, or that I have to buy dinner for the
cats tonight."  That's the FACT.  How it's stored is really the
computer's problem.  But at this point in time, it's most definitely
also the user's problem, and sometimes so laboriously so that people
just let data slip, rather than expend the effort to record it.

   <p>&ldquo;Remember&rdquo; is a mode for remembering data.  It uses whatever
back-end is appropriate to record and correlate the data, but its main
intention is to allow you to express as <em>little</em> structure as
possible up front.  If you later want to express more powerful
relationships between your data, or state assumptions that were at
first too implicit to be recognized, you can &ldquo;study&rdquo; the data later
and rearrange it.  But the initial &ldquo;just remember this&rdquo; impulse
should be as close to simply throwing the data at Emacs as possible.

   <p>Have you ever noticed that having a laptop to write on doesn't
<em>actually</em> increase the amount of quality material that you turn
out, in the long run?  Perhaps it's because the time we save
electronically in one way, we're losing electronically in another; the
tool should never dominate one's focus.  As the mystic Faridu'd-Din
`Attar wrote: &ldquo;Be occupied as little as possible with things of the
outer world but much with things of the inner world; then right action
will overcome inaction.&rdquo;

   <p>If Emacs could become a more intelligent data store, where brainstorming
would focus on the <em>ideas</em> involved&mdash;rather than the structuring
and format of those ideas, or having to stop your current flow of work
in order to record them&mdash;it would map much more closely to how the mind
(well, at least mine) works, and hence would eliminate that very
manual-ness which computers from the very beginning have been championed
as being able to reduce.
