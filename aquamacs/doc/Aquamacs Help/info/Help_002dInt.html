<h3 class="section">1.8 Some intermediate Info commands</h3>

<p>The introductory course is almost over; please continue
a little longer to learn some intermediate-level commands.

   <p>Most Info files have an index, which is actually a large node
containing little but a menu.  The menu has one menu item for each
topic listed in the index.  (As a special feature, menus for indices
may also include the line number within the node of the index entry. 
This allows Info readers to go to the exact line of an entry, not just
the start of the containing node.)

   <p>You can get to the index from the main menu of the file with the
<kbd>m</kbd> command and the name of the index node; then you can use the
<kbd>m</kbd> command again in the index node to go to the node that
describes the topic you want.

   <p>There is also a short-cut Info command, <kbd>i</kbd>, which does all of
that for you.  It searches the index for a given topic (a string) and
goes to the node which is listed in the index for that topic. 
See <a href="Search-Index.html#Search-Index">Search Index</a>, for a full explanation.

   <p><a name="index-l-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-37"></a><a name="index-Info_002dhistory_002dback-38"></a><a name="index-going-back-in-Info-history-39"></a>  If you have been moving around to different nodes and wish to
retrace your steps, the <kbd>l</kbd> command (<kbd>l</kbd> for <dfn>last</dfn>) will
do that, one node-step at a time.  As you move from node to node, Info
records the nodes where you have been in a special history list.  The
<kbd>l</kbd> command revisits nodes in the history list; each successive
<kbd>l</kbd> command moves one step back through the history.

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Try typing <kbd>p p n</kbd> and then three <kbd>l</kbd>'s, pausing in between
to see what each <kbd>l</kbd> does.  You should wind up right back here.
</pre>
   <p>Note the difference between <kbd>l</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd>: <kbd>l</kbd> moves to
where <em>you</em> last were, whereas <kbd>p</kbd> always moves to the node
which the header says is the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>&rsquo; node (from this node, the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Prev</span></samp>&rsquo; link leads to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Help-Xref</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p><a name="index-r-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-40"></a><a name="index-Info_002dhistory_002dforward-41"></a><a name="index-going-forward-in-Info-history-42"></a>  You can use the <kbd>r</kbd> command (<code>Info-history-forward</code> in Emacs)
to revisit nodes in the history list in the forward direction, so that
<kbd>r</kbd> will return you to the node you came from by typing <kbd>l</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-L-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-43"></a><a name="index-Info_002dhistory-44"></a><a name="index-history-list-of-visited-nodes-45"></a>  The <kbd>L</kbd> command (<code>Info-history</code> in Emacs) creates a virtual
node that contains a list of all nodes you visited.  You can select
a previously visited node from this menu to revisit it.

   <p><a name="index-d-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-46"></a><a name="index-Info_002ddirectory-47"></a><a name="index-go-to-Directory-node-48"></a>  The <kbd>d</kbd> command (<code>Info-directory</code> in Emacs) gets you
instantly to the Directory node.  This node, which is the first one
you saw when you entered Info, has a menu which leads (directly or
indirectly, through other menus), to all the nodes that exist.  The
Directory node lists all the manuals and other Info documents that
are, or could be, installed on your system.

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Try doing a <kbd>d</kbd>, then do an <kbd>l</kbd> to return here (yes,
   <em>do</em> return).
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-t-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-49"></a><a name="index-Info_002dtop_002dnode-50"></a><a name="index-go-to-Top-node-51"></a>  The <kbd>t</kbd> command moves to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo; node of the manual. 
This is useful if you want to browse the manual's main menu, or select
some specific top-level menu item.  The Emacs command run by <kbd>t</kbd>
is <code>Info-top-node</code>.

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>n</kbd> to see the last node of the course.
</pre>
   <p>See <a href="Advanced.html#Advanced">Advanced</a>, for more advanced Info features.

<!-- If a menu appears at the end of this node, remove it. -->
<!-- It is an accident of the menu updating command. -->
