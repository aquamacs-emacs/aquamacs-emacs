<h4 class="subsection">1.5.1 The <kbd>]</kbd> and <kbd>[</kbd> commands</h4>

<p>If you type <kbd>n</kbd> now, you get an error message saying that this
node has no next node.  Similarly, if you type <kbd>p</kbd>, the error
message tells you that there is no previous node.  (The exact message
depends on the Info reader you use.)  This is because <kbd>n</kbd> and
<kbd>p</kbd> carry you to the next and previous node <em>at the same
level</em>.  The present node is contained in a menu (see next) of the
node you came from, and hence is considered to be at a lower level. 
It is the only node in the previous node's menu (even though it was
listed three times). Hence it has no next or previous node that
<kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>p</kbd> could move to.

   <p>If you systematically move through a manual by typing <kbd>n</kbd>, you run
the risk of skipping many nodes.  You do not run this risk if you
systematically use <kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, because, when you scroll to the
bottom of a node and type another <kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, then this carries
you to the following node in the manual <em>regardless of level</em>. 
If you immediately want to go to that node, without having to scroll
to the bottom of the screen first, you can type <kbd>]</kbd>.

   <p>Similarly, <kbd>&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;</kbd> carries you to the preceding node
regardless of level, after you scrolled to the beginning of the
present node.  If you want to go to the preceding node immediately,
you can type <kbd>[</kbd>.

   <p>For instance, typing this sequence will come back here in three steps:
<kbd>[ n [</kbd>.  To do the same backward, type <kbd>] p ]</kbd>.

   <p>Now type <kbd>]</kbd> to go to the next node and learn about menus.
