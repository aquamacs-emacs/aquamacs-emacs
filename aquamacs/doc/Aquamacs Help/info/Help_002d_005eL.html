<h3 class="section">1.4 The Space, DEL, B and ^L commands</h3>

<p>This node's mode line tells you that you are now at node
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Help-^L</span></samp>&rsquo;, and the header line tells you that <kbd>p</kbd> would get
you back to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Help-P</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The node's title is highlighted and may be
underlined as well; it says what the node is about.

   <p>This is a big node and it does not all fit on your display screen. 
You can tell that there is more that is not visible because you
can see the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">All</span></samp>&rsquo; near the bottom of
the screen.

   <p><a name="index-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-8"></a><a name="index-DEL-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-9"></a><a name="index-BACKSPACE-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-10"></a><a name="index-Info_002dscroll_002dup-11"></a><a name="index-Info_002dscroll_002ddown-12"></a>  The &lt;SPC&gt;, &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; (or &lt;DEL&gt;)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> and <kbd>b</kbd> commands exist to
allow you to &ldquo;move around&rdquo; in a node that does not all fit on the
screen at once.  &lt;SPC&gt; moves forward, to show what was below the
bottom of the screen.  &lt;DEL&gt; or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; moves backward, to
show what was above the top of the screen (there is not anything above
the top until you have typed some spaces).

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now try typing a &lt;SPC&gt; (afterward, type a &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; to
   return here).
</pre>
   <p>When you type the &lt;SPC&gt;, the two lines that were at the bottom of
the screen appear at the top, followed by more lines.  &lt;DEL&gt; or
&lt;BACKSPACE&gt; takes the two lines from the top and moves them to the
bottom, <em>usually</em>, but if there are not a full screen's worth of
lines above them they may not make it all the way to the bottom.

   <p>If you are reading this in Emacs, note that the header line is
always visible, never scrolling off the display.  That way, you can
always see the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Prev</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>&rsquo; links, and you
can conveniently go to one of these links at any time by
clicking the middle mouse button on the link.

   <p><a name="index-reading-Info-documents-top-to-bottom-13"></a><a name="index-Info-documents-as-tutorials-14"></a>  &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt; not only move forward and backward through
the current node.  They also move between nodes.  &lt;SPC&gt; at the end
of a node moves to the next node; &lt;DEL&gt; (or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;) at
the beginning of a node moves to the previous node.  In effect, these
commands scroll through all the nodes in an Info file as a single
logical sequence.  You can read an entire manual top to bottom by just
typing &lt;SPC&gt;, and move backward through the entire manual from
bottom to top by typing &lt;DEL&gt; (or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;).

   <p>In this sequence, a node's subnodes appear following their parent. 
If a node has a menu, &lt;SPC&gt; takes you into the subnodes listed in
the menu, one by one.  Once you reach the end of a node, and have seen
all of its subnodes, &lt;SPC&gt; takes you to the next node or to the
parent's next node.

   <p><a name="index-PAGEUP-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-15"></a><a name="index-PAGEDOWN-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-16"></a>  Many keyboards nowadays have two scroll keys labeled &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PageUp</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PageDown</span></samp>&rsquo; (or maybe &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Prior</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo;).  If your
keyboard has these keys, you can use them to move forward and backward
through the text of one node, like &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; (or
&lt;DEL&gt;).  However, &lt;PAGEUP&gt; and &lt;PAGEDOWN&gt; keys never
scroll beyond the beginning or the end of the current node.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dl-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-17"></a>  If your screen is ever garbaged, you can tell Info to display it
again by typing <kbd>C-l</kbd> (<kbd>Control-L</kbd>&mdash;that is, hold down
&lt;CTRL&gt; and type <kbd>L</kbd> or <kbd>l</kbd>).

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>C-l</kbd> now.
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-b-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-18"></a>  To move back to the beginning of the node you are on, you can type
the &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; key (or &lt;DEL&gt;) many times.  You can also type
<kbd>b</kbd> just once.  <kbd>b</kbd> stands for &ldquo;beginning.&rdquo;

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Try that now.  (We have put in enough verbiage to push this past
   the first screenful, but screens are so big nowadays that perhaps it
   isn't enough.  You may need to shrink your Emacs or Info window.)
   Then come back, by typing &lt;SPC&gt; one or more times.
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_003f-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-19"></a><a name="index-Info_002dsummary-20"></a>  You have just learned a considerable number of commands.  If you
want to use one but have trouble remembering which, you should type
<kbd>?</kbd>, which displays a brief list of commands.  When you are
finished looking at the list, make it go away by typing &lt;SPC&gt;
repeatedly.

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Type a &lt;?&gt; now.  Press &lt;SPC&gt; to see consecutive screenfuls of
   the list until finished.  Then type &lt;SPC&gt; several times.  If
   you are using Emacs, the help will then go away automatically.
</pre>
   <p>(If you are using the stand-alone Info reader, type <kbd>C-x 0</kbd> to
return here, that is&mdash;press and hold &lt;CTRL&gt;, type an <kbd>x</kbd>,
then release &lt;CTRL&gt; and <kbd>x</kbd>, and press <kbd>0</kbd>; that's a zero,
not the letter &ldquo;o&rdquo;.)

   <p>From now on, you will encounter large nodes without warning, and
will be expected to know how to use &lt;SPC&gt; and &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; to
move around in them without being told.  Since not all terminals have
the same size screen, it would be impossible to warn you anyway.

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>n</kbd>, or click the middle mouse button on the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo; link,
   to visit the next node.
</pre>
   <div class="footnote">

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> The key which
we call &ldquo;Backspace or DEL&rdquo; in this manual is labeled differently on
different keyboards.  Look for a key which is a little ways above the
&lt;ENTER&gt; or &lt;RET&gt; key and which you normally use outside Emacs
to erase the character before the cursor, i.e. the character you
typed last.  It might be labeled &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backspace</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;-</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DEL</span></samp>&rsquo;, or sometimes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Delete</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
