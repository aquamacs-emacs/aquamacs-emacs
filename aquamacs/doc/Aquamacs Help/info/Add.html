<h3 class="section">3.1 Adding a new node to Info</h3>

<p>To add a new topic to the list in the Info directory, you must:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Create some nodes, in some file, to document that topic. 
<li>Put that topic in the menu in the directory.  See <a href="Menus.html#Menus">Menu</a>.
        </ol>

   <p><a name="index-node-delimiters-90"></a>  The new node can live in an existing documentation file, or in a new
one.  It must have a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^_</span></samp>&rsquo; character before it (invisible to the
user; this node has one but you cannot see it), and it ends with either
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^_</span></samp>&rsquo;, a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^L</span></samp>&rsquo; (&ldquo;formfeed&rdquo;), or the end of file.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^_</span></samp>&rsquo; starting a node must be followed by a newline or a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^L</span></samp>&rsquo; newline, after which comes the node's header line.  The
header line must give the node's name (by which Info finds it), and
state the names of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>&rsquo;
nodes (if there are any).  As you can see, this node's &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>&rsquo; node
is the node &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Expert Info</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo; node is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Menus</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-node-header-line-format-91"></a><a name="index-format-of-node-headers-92"></a>  The keywords <dfn>Node</dfn>, <dfn>Next</dfn>, <dfn>Previous</dfn>, and <dfn>Up</dfn>
may appear in any order, anywhere in the header line, but the
recommended order is the one in this sentence.  Each keyword must be
followed by a colon, spaces and tabs, and then the appropriate name. 
The name may be terminated with a tab, a comma, or a newline.  A space
does not end it; node names may contain spaces.  The case of letters
in the names is insignificant.

   <p><a name="index-node-name-format-93"></a><a name="index-Directory-node-94"></a>  A node name has two forms.  A node in the current file is named by
what appears after the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Node: </span></samp>&rsquo; in that node's first line.  For
example, this node's name is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Add</span></samp>&rsquo;.  A node in another file is
named by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span><var>filename</var><span class="samp">)</span><var>node-within-file</var></samp>&rsquo;, as in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(info)Add</span></samp>&rsquo; for this node.  If the file name starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./</span></samp>&rsquo;,
then it is relative to the current directory; otherwise, it is
relative starting from the standard directory for Info files of your
site.  The name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span><var>filename</var><span class="samp">)Top</span></samp>&rsquo; can be abbreviated to just
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span><var>filename</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  By convention, the name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo; is used
for the &ldquo;highest&rdquo; node in any single file&mdash;the node whose &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>&rsquo;
points out of the file.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Directory</span></samp>&rsquo; node is <samp><span class="file">(dir)</span></samp>, it
points to a file <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp> which holds a large menu listing all the
Info documents installed on your site.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo; node of a
document file listed in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Directory</span></samp>&rsquo; should have an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up:
(dir)</span></samp>&rsquo; in it.

   <p><a name="index-unstructured-documents-95"></a>  The node name <kbd>*</kbd> is special: it refers to the entire file. 
Thus, <kbd>g*</kbd> shows you the whole current file.  The use of the
node <kbd>*</kbd> is to make it possible to make old-fashioned,
unstructured files into nodes of the tree.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Node:</span></samp>&rsquo; name, in which a node states its own name, must not
contain a file name, since when Info searches for a node, it does not
expect a file name to be there.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>&rsquo; names may contain them.  In this node, since the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>&rsquo;
node is in the same file, it was not necessary to use one.

   <p>Note that the nodes in this file have a file name in the header
line.  The file names are ignored by Info, but they serve as comments
to help identify the node for the user.

   <div class="footnote">

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> If
you put in a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^L</span></samp>&rsquo; to end a new node, be sure that there is a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^_</span></samp>&rsquo; after it to start the next one, since &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^L</span></samp>&rsquo; cannot
<em>start</em> a node.  Also, a nicer way to make a node boundary be a
page boundary as well is to put a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^L</span></samp>&rsquo; <em>right after</em> the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^_</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>
