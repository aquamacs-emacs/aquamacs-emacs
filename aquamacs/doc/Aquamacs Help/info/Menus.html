<h3 class="section">3.2 How to Create Menus</h3>

<p>Any node in the Info hierarchy may have a <dfn>menu</dfn>&mdash;a list of subnodes. 
The <kbd>m</kbd> command searches the current node's menu for the topic which it
reads from the terminal.

   <p><a name="index-menu-and-menu-entry-format-96"></a>  A menu begins with a line starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*&nbsp;Menu:</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  The
rest of the line is a comment.  After the starting line, every line
that begins with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">* </span></samp>&rsquo; lists a single topic.  The name of the
topic&mdash;what the user must type at the <kbd>m</kbd>'s command prompt to
select this topic&mdash;comes right after the star and space, and is
followed by a colon, spaces and tabs, and the name of the node which
discusses that topic.  The node name, like node names following
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up</span></samp>&rsquo;, may be terminated with a
tab, comma, or newline; it may also be terminated with a period.

   <p>If the node name and topic name are the same, then rather than
giving the name twice, the abbreviation &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">* </span><var>name</var><span class="samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo; may be
used (and should be used, whenever possible, as it reduces the visual
clutter in the menu).

   <p>It is considerate to choose the topic names so that they differ
from each other very near the beginning&mdash;this allows the user to type
short abbreviations.  In a long menu, it is a good idea to capitalize
the beginning of each item name which is the minimum acceptable
abbreviation for it (a long menu is more than 5 or so entries).

   <p>The nodes listed in a node's menu are called its &ldquo;subnodes,&rdquo; and it
is their &ldquo;superior&rdquo;.  They should each have an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up:</span></samp>&rsquo; pointing at
the superior.  It is often useful to arrange all or most of the subnodes
in a sequence of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Next</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Previous</span></samp>&rsquo; pointers so that
someone who wants to see them all need not keep revisiting the Menu.

   <p>The Info Directory is simply the menu of the node &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(dir)Top</span></samp>&rsquo;&mdash;that
is, node &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo; in file <samp><span class="file">.../info/dir</span></samp>.  You can put new entries
in that menu just like any other menu.  The Info Directory is <em>not</em> the
same as the file directory called <samp><span class="file">info</span></samp>.  It happens that many of
Info's files live in that file directory, but they do not have to; and
files in that directory are not automatically listed in the Info
Directory node.

   <p>Also, although the Info node graph is claimed to be a &ldquo;hierarchy,&rdquo;
in fact it can be <em>any</em> directed graph.  Shared structures and
pointer cycles are perfectly possible, and can be used if they are
appropriate to the meaning to be expressed.  There is no need for all
the nodes in a file to form a connected structure.  In fact, this file
has two connected components.  You are in one of them, which is under
the node &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo;; the other contains the node &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Help</span></samp>&rsquo; which the
<kbd>h</kbd> command goes to.  In fact, since there is no garbage
collector on the node graph, nothing terrible happens if a substructure
is not pointed to, but such a substructure is rather useless since nobody
can ever find out that it exists.
