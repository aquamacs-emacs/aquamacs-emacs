<h3 class="section">1.6 Menus and the <kbd>m</kbd> command</h3>

<p><a name="index-menus-in-an-Info-document-23"></a><a name="index-Info-menus-24"></a>  With only the <kbd>n</kbd> (next), <kbd>p</kbd> (previous), <kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>,
<kbd>&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>]</kbd> and <kbd>[</kbd> commands for moving between
nodes, nodes are restricted to a linear sequence.  Menus allow a
branching structure.  A menu is a list of other nodes you can move to. 
It is actually just part of the text of the node formatted specially
so that Info can interpret it.  The beginning of a menu is always
identified by a line which starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*&nbsp;Menu:</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  A node
contains a menu if and only if it has a line in it which starts that
way.  The only menu you can use at any moment is the one in the node
you are in.  To use a menu in any other node, you must move to that
node first.

   <p>After the start of the menu, each line that starts with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;
identifies one subtopic.  The line usually contains a brief name for
the subtopic (followed by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;, normally hidden in Emacs), the
name of the node that talks about that subtopic (again, normally
hidden in Emacs), and optionally some further description of the
subtopic.  Lines in the menu that do not start with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; have no
special meaning&mdash;they are only for the human reader's benefit and do
not define additional subtopics.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     * Foo:  Node about FOO.      This tells about FOO.
</pre>
   <p>The subtopic name is Foo, and the node describing it is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Node
about FOO</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The rest of the line is just for the reader's
Information.  [[ But this line is not a real menu item, simply because
there is no line above it which starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*&nbsp;Menu:</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  Also,
in a real menu item, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; would appear at the very start of
the line.  This is why the &ldquo;normally hidden&rdquo; text in Emacs, namely
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">: Node about FOO.</span></samp>&rsquo;, is actually visible in this example, even
when Visible mode is off.]]

   <p>When you use a menu to go to another node (in a way that will be
described soon), what you specify is the subtopic name, the first
thing in the menu line.  Info uses it to find the menu line, extracts
the node name from it, and goes to that node.  The reason that there
is both a subtopic name and a node name is that the node name must be
meaningful to the computer and may therefore have to be ugly looking. 
The subtopic name can be chosen just to be convenient for the user to
specify.  Often the node name is convenient for the user to specify
and so both it and the subtopic name are the same.  There is an
abbreviation for this:

<pre class="example">     * Foo::   This tells about FOO.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This means that the subtopic name and node name are the same; they are
both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Foo</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo; is normally hidden in Emacs.)

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now use &lt;SPC&gt; to find the menu in this node, then come back to
   the front with a <kbd>b</kbd> and some &lt;SPC&gt;s.  As you see, a menu is
   actually visible in its node.  If you cannot find a menu in a node
   by looking at it, then the node does not have a menu and the
   <kbd>m</kbd> command is not available.
</pre>
   <p>If you keep typing &lt;SPC&gt; once the menu appears on the screen, it
will move to another node (the first one in the menu).  If that
happens, type &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; to come back.

   <p><a name="index-m-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-25"></a>  The command to go to one of the subnodes is <kbd>m</kbd>.  This is very
different from the commands you have used: it is a command that
prompts you for more input.

   <p>The Info commands you know do not need additional input; when you
type one of them, Info processes it instantly and then is ready for
another command.  The <kbd>m</kbd> command is different: it needs to know
the <dfn>name of the subtopic</dfn>.  Once you have typed <kbd>m</kbd>, Info
tries to read the subtopic name.

   <p>Now, in the stand-alone Info, look for the line containing many
dashes near the bottom of the screen.  (This is the stand-alone
equivalent for the mode line in Emacs.)  There is one more line
beneath that one, but usually it is blank.  (In Emacs, this is the
echo area.)  When it is blank, Info is ready for a command, such as
<kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>b</kbd> or &lt;SPC&gt; or <kbd>m</kbd>.  If that line contains
text ending in a colon, it means Info is reading more input for the
last command.  You can't type an Info command then, because Info is
trying to read input, not commands.  You must either give the input
and finish the command you started, or type <kbd>Control-g</kbd> to cancel
the command.  When you have done one of those things, the input entry
line becomes blank again.  Then you can type Info commands again.

   <p><a name="index-Info_002dmenu-26"></a>  The command to go to a subnode via a menu is <kbd>m</kbd>.  After you type
the <kbd>m</kbd>, the line at the bottom of the screen says &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Menu item: </span></samp>&rsquo;. 
You must then type the name of the subtopic you want, and end it with
a &lt;RET&gt;.

   <p><a name="index-abbreviating-Info-subnodes-27"></a>  You can abbreviate the subtopic name.  If the abbreviation is not
unique, the first matching subtopic is chosen.  Some menus put
the shortest possible abbreviation for each subtopic name in capital
letters, so you can see how much you need to type.  It does not
matter whether you use upper case or lower case when you type the
subtopic.  You should not put any spaces at the end, or inside of the
item name, except for one space where a space appears in the item in
the menu.

   <p><a name="index-completion-of-Info-node-names-28"></a>  You can also use the <dfn>completion</dfn> feature to help enter the
subtopic name.  If you type the &lt;TAB&gt; key after entering part of a
name, it will fill in more of the name&mdash;as much as Info can deduce
from the part you have entered.

   <p>If you move the cursor to one of the menu subtopic lines, then you do
not need to type the argument: you just type a &lt;RET&gt;, and it
stands for the subtopic of the line you are on.  You can also click
the middle mouse button directly on the subtopic line to go there.

   <p>Here is a menu to give you a chance to practice.  This menu gives you
three ways of going to one place, Help-FOO:

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="Help_002dFOO.html#Help_002dFOO">Foo</a>:        A node you can visit for fun. 
<li><a accesskey="2" href="Help_002dFOO.html#Help_002dFOO">Bar</a>:        We have made two ways to get to the same place. 
<li><a accesskey="3" href="Help_002dFOO.html#Help_002dFOO">Help-FOO</a>:             And yet another! 
</ul>

   <p>(Turn Visible mode on if you are using Emacs.)

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt;  Now type just an <kbd>m</kbd> and see what happens:
</pre>
   <p>Now you are &ldquo;inside&rdquo; an <kbd>m</kbd> command.  Commands cannot be used
now; the next thing you will type must be the name of a subtopic.

   <p>You can change your mind about doing the <kbd>m</kbd> by typing
<kbd>Control-g</kbd>.

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Try that now;  notice the bottom line clear.
</pre>
   <pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Then type another <kbd>m</kbd>.
</pre>
   <pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>BAR</kbd>, the item name.  Do not type &lt;RET&gt; yet.
</pre>
   <p>While you are typing the item name, you can use the &lt;DEL&gt; (or
&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;) key to cancel one character at a time if you make a
mistake.

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Press &lt;DEL&gt; to cancel the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You could type another <kbd>R</kbd>
   to replace it.  But you do not have to, since &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BA</span></samp>&rsquo; is a valid
   abbreviation.
</pre>
   <pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Now you are ready to go.  Type a &lt;RET&gt;.
</pre>
   <p>After visiting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Help-FOO</span></samp>&rsquo;, you should return here.

   <p>Another way to move to the menu subtopic lines and between them is
to type &lt;TAB&gt;.  Each time you type a &lt;TAB&gt;, you move to the
next subtopic line.  To move to a previous subtopic line in the
stand-alone reader, type <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>&mdash;that is, press and hold
the &lt;META&gt; key and then press &lt;TAB&gt;.  (On some keyboards, the
&lt;META&gt; key might be labeled &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Alt</span></samp>&rsquo;.)  In Emacs Info, type
<kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to move to a previous subtopic line (press and hold
the &lt;Shift&gt; key and then press &lt;TAB&gt;).

   <p>Once you move cursor to a subtopic line, press &lt;RET&gt; to go to
that subtopic's node.

   <p><a name="index-mouse-support-in-Info-mode-29"></a><a name="index-Mouse_002d2-_0040r_007b_0028Info-mode_0029_007d-30"></a>  If your terminal supports a mouse, you have yet another way of going
to a subtopic.  Move your mouse pointer to the subtopic line,
somewhere between the beginning &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; and the colon &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; which
ends the subtopic's brief name.  You will see the subtopic's name
change its appearance (usually, its background color will change), and
the shape of the mouse pointer will change if your platform supports
that.  After a while, if you leave the mouse on that spot, a small
window will pop up, saying &ldquo;Mouse-2: go to that node,&rdquo; or the same
message may appear at the bottom of the screen.

   <p><kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> is the second button of your mouse counting from the
left&mdash;the middle button on a 3-button mouse.  (On a 2-button mouse,
you may have to press both buttons together to &ldquo;press the middle
button&rdquo;.)  The message tells you pressing <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> with the
current position of the mouse pointer (on subtopic in the menu) will
go to that subtopic.

   <p><a name="index-Info_002dmouse_002dfollow_002dnearest_002dnode-31"></a>  More generally, <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> in an Info buffer finds the nearest
link to another node and goes there.  For example, near a cross
reference it acts like <kbd>f</kbd>, in a menu it acts like <kbd>m</kbd>, on the
node's header line it acts like <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>p</kbd>, or <kbd>u</kbd>, etc.  At
end of the node's text <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> moves to the next node, or up if
there's no next node.

<pre class="format">&gt;&gt; Type <kbd>n</kbd> to see more commands.
