Who's behind Aquamacs?

<P>
It's a free software project, and naturally, Aquamacs could not exist
without the help of developers, designers, writers and users. The
following people have contributed code, bug reports and ideas to the
Aquamacs project at one point of the other.<A ID="tex2html24"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot271"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN></SUP></A>
<P>
Aquamacs development was led from 2005 to 2019 by David Reitter, a German-American computer scientist and cognitive scientist.

<P>
Throughout this time, many contributions in form of bug reports and fixes were provided by Konrad Podczeck, Nathaniel Cunningham, José  Figueroa-O'Farrill, Jean-Christophe Helary, and other regular users.  Win Treese is release manager for Aquamacs starting with 3.6.

<P>
Kevin Walzer co-founded the Aquamacs project and wrote the first manual. Aquamacs contains icon artwork by Adrian Chromenko, Jessica Walker (Aquamacs 2.0/3.0 application icon) and David Reitter,
Jasper Hauser, and the Nuovext Project.  The Aquamacs website was designed by Ted Roden.

<P>
We would also like to acknowledge the contributions of the many authors
whose source code and hints on public forums have already been
integrated into the build.  They are too numerous to mention here.

<P>
Aquamacs is based on GNU Emacs, which is the work of Richard Stallman and many other developers, in particular Andrew Choi (original GNU Emacs-to-MacOS and OSX ports), Steven Tamm, Alan Third, Mitsuharu Yamamoto, Adrian Robert.  Aquamacs also could not exist without the latest code contribtions to GNU Emacs (now lead by Stefan Monnier) and to its Mac/OSX/Nextstep ports ( Jan djärv, Yamamoto Mitsuharu, and others). We also would like to acknowledge the work of the many authors of the major modes included.

<P>
Last but not least, Aquamacs exists because of the dedication of
its users, who donate money, report bugs and help us fix them.

<P>
