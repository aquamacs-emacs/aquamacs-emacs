The preface originally included the following text which I use to
begin my story:

   <blockquote>
But it's important to note a brief history of MH-E.

   <p>Version&nbsp;3<!-- /@w --> was prevalent through the Emacs&nbsp;18<!-- /@w --> and early
Emacs&nbsp;19<!-- /@w --> years. Then Version&nbsp;4<!-- /@w --> came out (Emacs&nbsp;19.23<!-- /@w -->),
which introduced several new and changed commands. Next, Version&nbsp;5.0<!-- /@w --> was released, which fixed some bugs and incompatibilities, and
was incorporated into Emacs&nbsp;19.29<!-- /@w -->. 
</blockquote>

   <p>After a long break, Stephen handed the reins over to me in 2000. I
moved the project to a new site called SourceForge and organized a
great team of developers. Our first release in late 2001 was version
6. It appeared around the time of Emacs 21.2 and had menus and tool
bar buttons.

   <p>Then, indexed searches, improved MIME handling, a speedbar, multiple
identities, alias completion, an index view of unseen messages, spam
software support, Face and X-Image-URL header field support, Fcc
completion, arbitrary range handling, and draft form editing were
introduced in the version 7 series around the time of Emacs 21.4
(2004). Still, Emacs itself contained version 5 of MH-E released back
in 1994.

   <p>Version 8 development was mostly driven by the rewrite of the manual. 
It also brought GNU mailutils MH support, S/MIME support, picon
support, and an improved interface for hiding header fields. The CVS
repository was migrated from SourceForge to Savannah (only for those
files that were already part of Emacs) and the software was completely
reorganized to push back two decades of entropy. Version 8 appeared in
Emacs 22.1 in 2006.

   <p>Development was then quiet for a couple of years. Emacs 23.1, which is
due out in 2009, will contain version 8.1. This version includes a few
new features and several bug fixes.

   <p>Bill Wohler, August 2008
