<p><a name="index-virus-protection-82"></a>
Whenever a formula or printer is read from a file or is pasted into
the spreadsheet, it receives a &ldquo;needs safety check&rdquo; marking.  Later,
when the formula or printer is evaluated for the first time, it is
checked for safety using the <code>unsafep</code> predicate; if found to be
&ldquo;possibly unsafe&rdquo;, the questionable formula or printer is displayed
and you must press Y to approve it or N to use a substitute.  The
substitute always signals an error.

   <p>Formulas or printers that you type in are checked immediately for
safety.  If found to be possibly unsafe and you press N to disapprove,
the action is canceled and the old formula or printer will remain.

   <p>Besides viruses (which try to copy themselves to other files),
<code>unsafep</code> can also detect all other kinds of Trojan horses, such as
spreadsheets that delete files, send email, flood Web sites, alter
your Emacs settings, etc.

   <p>Generally, spreadsheet formulas and printers are simple things that
don't need to do any fancy computing, so all potentially-dangerous
parts of the Emacs Lisp environment can be excluded without cramping
your style as a formula-writer.  See the documentation in <samp><span class="file">unsafep.el</span></samp>
for more info on how Lisp forms are classified as safe or unsafe.
