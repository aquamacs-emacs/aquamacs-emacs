  <h3 class="section">3.1 Lesson I: Development Cycle</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this tutorial is to guide you through a very
  basic development cycle using IDLWAVE. We will paste a simple
  program into a buffer and use the shell to compile, debug and run
  it. On the way we will use many of the important IDLWAVE
  commands. Note, however, that IDLWAVE has many more capabilities
  than covered here, which can be discovered by reading the entire
  manual, or hovering over the shoulder of your nearest IDLWAVE
  guru for a few days.</p>

  <p>It is assumed that you have access to Emacs or XEmacs with the
  full IDLWAVE package including online help. We also assume that
  you are familiar with Emacs and can read the nomenclature of key
  presses in Emacs (in particular, <kbd>C</kbd> stands for
  <tt class="key">CONTROL</tt> and <kbd>M</kbd> for <tt class=
  "key">META</tt> (often the <tt class="key">ALT</tt> key carries
  this functionality)).</p>

  <p>Open a new source file by typing:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
<kbd>C-x C-f tutorial.pro <span class="key">RET</span></kbd>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>A buffer for this file will pop up, and it should be in
  IDLWAVE mode, indicated in the mode line just below the editing
  window. Also, the menu bar should contain
  &lsquo;<samp>IDLWAVE</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>Now cut-and-paste the following code, also available as
  <samp>tutorial.pro</samp> in the IDLWAVE distribution.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
function daynr,d,m,y
  ;; compute a sequence number for a date
  ;; works 1901-2099.
  if y lt 100 then y = y+1900
  if m le 2 then delta = 1 else delta = 0
  m1 = m + delta*12 + 1
  y1 = y * delta
  return, d + floor(m1*30.6)+floor(y1*365.25)+5
end

function weekday,day,month,year
  ;; compute weekday number for date
  nr = daynr(day,month,year)
  return, nr mod 7
end

pro plot_wday,day,month
  ;; Plot the weekday of a date in the first 10 years of this century.
  years = 2000,+indgen(10)
  wdays = intarr(10)
  for i=0,n_elements(wdays)-1 do begin
      wdays[i] =  weekday(day,month,years[i])
  end
  plot,years,wdays,YS=2,YT="Wday (0=Sunday)"
end
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The indentation probably looks funny, since it&rsquo;s
  different from the settings you use, so use the <tt class=
  "key">TAB</tt> key in each line to automatically line it up (or,
  more quickly, <em>select</em> the entire buffer with <kbd>C-x
  h</kbd>, and indent the whole region with <kbd>C-M-\</kbd>).
  Notice how different syntactical elements are highlighted in
  different colors, if you have set up support for font-lock.</p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s check out two particular editing features of
  IDLWAVE. Place the cursor after the <code>end</code> statement of
  the <code>for</code> loop and press <tt class="key">SPC</tt>.
  IDLWAVE blinks back to the beginning of the block and changes the
  generic <code>end</code> to the specific <code>endfor</code>
  automatically (as long as the variable
  <code>idlwave-expand-generic-end</code> is turned on; see
  <a href="Lesson-II_002d_002d_002dCustomization.html#Lesson-II_002d_002d_002dCustomization">
  Lesson II---Customization</a>). Now place the cursor in any line
  you would like to split and press <kbd>M-<span class=
  "key">RET</span></kbd>. The line is split at the cursor position,
  with the continuation &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; and
  indentation all taken care of. Use <kbd>C-/</kbd> to undo the
  last change.</p>

  <p>The procedure <code>plot_wday</code> is supposed to plot the
  day of the week of a given date for the first 10 years of the
  21st century. As in most code, there are a few bugs, which we are
  going to use IDLWAVE to help us fix.</p>

  <p>First, let&rsquo;s launch the IDLWAVE shell. You do this with
  the command <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>. The Emacs window will split or
  another window will popup to display IDL running in a shell
  interaction buffer. Type a few commands like
  <code>print,!PI</code> to convince yourself that you can work
  there just as well as in a terminal, or the IDLDE. Use the arrow
  keys to cycle through your command history. Are we having fun
  now?</p>

  <p>Now go back to the source window and type <kbd>C-c C-d
  C-c</kbd> to compile the program. If you watch the shell buffer,
  you see that IDLWAVE types &lsquo;<samp>.run
  "tutorial.pro"</samp>&rsquo; for you. But the compilation fails
  because there is a comma in the line
  &lsquo;<samp>years=...</samp>&rsquo;. The line with the error is
  highlighted and the cursor positioned at the error, so remove the
  comma (you should only need to hit <kbd>Delete</kbd>!). Compile
  again, using the same keystrokes as before. Notice that the file
  is automatically saved for you. This time everything should work
  fine, and you should see the three routines compile.</p>

  <p>Now we want to use the command to plot the day of the week on
  January 1st. We could type the full command ourselves, but why do
  that? Go back to the shell window, type
  &lsquo;<samp>plot_</samp>&rsquo; and hit <tt class=
  "key">TAB</tt>. After a bit of a delay (while IDLWAVE initializes
  its routine info database, if necessary), the window will split
  to show all procedures it knows starting with that string, and
  <code><span class="nolinebreak">plot_wday</span></code> 
  <!-- /@w --> should be one of them. Saving the buffer alerted
  IDLWAVE about this new routine. Click with the middle mouse
  button on <code>plot_wday</code> and it will be copied to the
  shell buffer, or if you prefer, add &lsquo;<samp>w</samp>&rsquo;
  to &lsquo;<samp>plot_</samp>&rsquo; to make it unambiguous
  (depending on what other routines starting with
  &lsquo;<samp>plot_</samp>&rsquo; you have installed on your
  system), hit <tt class="key">TAB</tt> again, and the full routine
  name will be completed. Now provide the two arguments:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
plot_wday,1,1
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>and press <tt class="key">RET</tt>. This fails with an error
  message telling you the <code>YT</code> keyword to plot is
  ambiguous. What are the allowed keywords again? Go back to the
  source window and put the cursor into the &ldquo;plot&rdquo; line
  and press <kbd>C-c ?</kbd>. This shows the routine info window
  for the plot routine, which contains a list of keywords, along
  with the argument list. Oh, we wanted <code>YTITLE</code>. Fix
  that up. Recompile with <kbd>C-c C-d C-c</kbd>. Jump back into
  the shell with <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>, press the <tt class=
  "key">UP</tt> arrow to recall the previous command and execute
  again.</p>

  <p>This time we get a plot, but it is pretty ugly: the points are
  all connected with a line. Hmm, isn&rsquo;t there a way for
  <code>plot</code> to use symbols instead? What was that keyword?
  Position the cursor on the plot line after a comma (where
  you&rsquo;d normally type a keyword), and hit <kbd>M-<span class=
  "key">Tab</span></kbd>. A long list of plot&rsquo;s keywords
  appears. Aha, there it is, <code>PSYM</code>. Middle click to
  insert it. An &lsquo;<samp>=</samp>&rsquo; sign is included for
  you too. Now what were the values of <code>PSYM</code> supposed
  to be? With the cursor on or after the keyword, press
  <kbd>M-?</kbd> for online help (alternatively, you could have
  right clicked on the colored keyword itself in the completion
  list). A browser will pop up showing the HTML documentation for
  the <code>PYSM</code> keyword. OK, let&rsquo;s use diamonds=4.
  Fix this, recompile (you know the command by now: <kbd>C-c C-d
  C-c</kbd>), go back to the shell (if it&rsquo;s vanished, you
  know what to do: <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>) and execute again. Now
  things look pretty good.</p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s try a different day. How about April fool&rsquo;s
  day?</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
plot_wday,1,4
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Oops, this looks very wrong. All April Fool&rsquo;s days
  cannot be Fridays! We&rsquo;ve got a bug in the program, perhaps
  in the <code>daynr</code> function. Let&rsquo;s put a breakpoint
  on the last line there. Position the cursor on the
  &lsquo;<samp>return, d+...</samp>&rsquo; line and press <kbd>C-c
  C-d C-b</kbd>. IDL sets a breakpoint (as you see in the shell
  window), and the break line is indicated. Back to the shell
  buffer, re-execute the previous command. IDL stops at the line
  with the breakpoint. Now hold down the SHIFT key and click with
  the middle mouse button on a few variables there:
  &lsquo;<samp>d</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>m</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>y1</samp>&rsquo;, etc.
  Maybe <code>d</code> isn&rsquo;t the correct type. CONTROL-SHIFT
  middle-click on it for help. Well, it&rsquo;s an integer, so
  that&rsquo;s not the problem. Aha, &lsquo;<samp>y1</samp>&rsquo;
  is zero, but it should be the year, depending on delta. Shift
  click &lsquo;<samp>delta</samp>&rsquo; to see that it&rsquo;s 0.
  Below, we see the offending line:
  &lsquo;<samp>y1=y*delta...</samp>&rsquo; the multiplication
  should have been a minus sign! Hit <kbd>q</kbd> to exit the
  debugging mode, and fix the line to read:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
y1 = y - delta
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Now remove all breakpoints: <kbd>C-c C-d C-a</kbd>. Recompile
  and rerun the command. Everything should now work fine. How about
  those leap years? Change the code to plot 100 years and see that
  every 28 years, the sequence of weekdays repeats.</p>
