<h2 class="chapter">1 About PCL-CVS</h2>

<p><a name="index-About-PCL_002dCVS-1"></a>
PCL-CVS is a front-end to CVS versions 1.9 and later. 
It concisely shows the present status of a checked out module in an
Emacs buffer and provides single-key access to the most frequently used CVS
commands.  Note that the <code>vc-dir</code> command (see <a href="emacs.html#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>) provides similar
functionality, but for several version control systems, including CVS.

   <p>PCL-CVS was originally written many years ago by Per Cederqvist who
proudly maintained it until January 1996, at which point he released the
beta version 2.0b2 and passed on the maintainership to Greg A Woods. 
Development stayed mostly dormant for a few years during which
version 2.0 never seemed to be able to leave the &ldquo;beta&rdquo; stage while a
separate XEmacs version was slowly splitting away.  In late 1998,
Stefan Monnier picked up development again, adding some major new
functionality and taking over the maintenance.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Contributors to PCL-CVS</h3>

<p><a name="index-Contributors-2"></a><a name="index-Authors-3"></a>
Contributions to the package are welcome.  I have limited time to work
on this project, but I will gladly add any code that you contribute to
me to this package (see <a href="#Bugs">Bugs</a>).

   <p>The following persons have made contributions to PCL-CVS.

     <ul>
<li>Brian Berliner wrote CVS, together with some other contributors. 
Without his work on CVS this package would be useless<small class="dots">...</small>

     <li>Per Cederqvist wrote most of the otherwise unattributed functions in
PCL-CVS as well as all the documentation.

     <li><!-- inge@@lysator.liu.se -->
Inge Wallin wrote the skeleton of
<samp><span class="file">pcl-cvs.texi</span></samp>, and gave useful comments on it.  He also wrote
the files <samp><span class="file">elib-node.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">compile-all.el</span></samp>.  The file
<samp><span class="file">cookie.el</span></samp> was inspired by Inge.

     <li><!-- linus@@lysator.liu.se -->
Linus Tolke contributed useful comments
on both the functionality and the documentation.

     <li><!-- jwz@@jwz.com -->
Jamie Zawinski contributed
<samp><span class="file">pcl-cvs-lucid.el</span></samp>, which was later renamed to
<samp><span class="file">pcl-cvs-xemacs.el</span></samp>.

     <li>Leif Lonnblad contributed RCVS support (since superseded by the new
remote CVS support).

     <li><!-- jimb@@cyclic.com -->
Jim Blandy contributed hooks to automatically
guess CVS log entries from <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> contents, and initial support of
the new Cygnus / Cyclic remote CVS, as well as various sundry bug fixes
and cleanups.

     <li><!-- kingdon@@cyclic.com -->
Jim Kingdon contributed lots of fixes to
the build and installation procedure.

     <li><!-- woods@@weird.com -->
Greg A. Woods contributed code to implement
the use of per-file diff buffers, and vendor join diffs with emerge and
ediff, as well as various and sundry bug fixes and cleanups.

     <li><!-- greg.klanderman@@alum.mit.edu -->
Greg Klanderman implemented
toggling of marked files, setting of CVS command flags via prefix
arguments, updated the XEmacs support, updated the manual, and fixed
numerous bugs.

     <li><!-- monnier@@gnu.org -->
Stefan Monnier added a slew of other
features and introduced even more new bugs.  If there's any bug left,
you can be sure it's his.

     <li><!-- wordy to avoid an underfull hbox -->
<!-- masata-y@@is.aist-nara.ac.jp -->
Masatake YAMATO made a gracious
contribution of his cvstree code to display a tree of tags which was later
superseded by the new <code>cvs-status-mode</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>Apart from these, a lot of people have sent us suggestions, ideas,
requests, bug reports and encouragement.  Thanks a lot!  Without you
there would be no new releases of PCL-CVS.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Getting started</h2>

<p><a name="index-Introduction-4"></a><a name="index-Example-run-5"></a><a name="index-Sample-session-6"></a>
This document assumes that you know what CVS is, and that you at least
know the fundamental concepts of CVS.  If that is not the case, you
should read the CVS documentation.  Type <kbd>info -f cvs</kbd> or <kbd>man
cvs</kbd>.

   <p>PCL-CVS is only useful once you have checked out a module.  So before
you invoke it, you must have a copy of a module somewhere in the file
system.

   <p>You can invoke PCL-CVS by typing <kbd>M-x cvs-examine &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
You can also invoke it via the menu bar, under &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Tools</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Or, if you prefer, you can also invoke PCL-CVS by simply visiting the
CVS administrative subdirectory of your module, with a prefix argument. 
For example, to invoke PCL-CVS in a separate frame, type <kbd>C-u C-x 5
f ~/my/project/CVS &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>The function <code>cvs-examine</code> will ask for a directory.  The command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs -n update</span></samp>&rsquo; will be run in that directory.  (It should contain
files that have been checked out from a CVS archive.)  The output from
<code>cvs</code> will be parsed and presented in a table in a buffer called
<samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp>.  It might look something like this:

<pre class="example">     Repository : /usr/CVSroot
     Module     : test
     Working dir: /users/ceder/FOO/test
     
     
     In directory .:
                Need-Update            bar
                Need-Update            file.txt
                Modified               namechange
                Need-Update            newer
     In directory sub:
                Modified               ChangeLog
     
     --------------------- End ---------------------
     -- last cmd: cvs -f -z6 -n update -d -P --
</pre>
   <p>In this example, your repository is in <samp><span class="file">/usr/CVSroot</span></samp> and CVS has
been run in the directory <samp><span class="file">/users/ceder/FOO/test</span></samp>.  The three files
(<samp><span class="file">bar</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">file.txt</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">newer</span></samp>) that are marked with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Need-Update</span></samp>&rsquo; have been changed
by someone else in the CVS repository.  Two files (<samp><span class="file">namechange</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">sub/ChangeLog</span></samp>) have been modified locally, and need to be
checked in.

   <p>You can move the cursor up and down in the buffer with <kbd>C-n</kbd> and
<kbd>C-p</kbd> or <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd>.  If you press <kbd>c</kbd> on one of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Modified</span></samp>&rsquo; files, that file will be checked in to the CVS
repository. See <a href="#Committing-changes">Committing changes</a>.  You can also press <kbd>O</kbd> to
update any of the files that are marked &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Need-Update</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You can
also run <kbd>M-x cvs-update &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (bound to <kbd>M-u</kbd> in the
<samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp> buffer) to update all the files.

   <p>You can then press <kbd>=</kbd> to easily get a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">diff</span></samp>&rsquo; between your
modified file and the base version that you started from, or you can
press <kbd>l</kbd> to get the output from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs log</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Many more such
commands are available simply by pressing a key (see <a href="#Getting-info-about-files">Getting info about files</a>).

The display contains several columns, some of which are optional. 
These columns are, from left to right:

     <ul>
<li>Optionally, the head revision of the file.  This is the latest version
found in the repository.  It might also contain (instead of the head
revision) a sub status which typically gives further information about
how we got to the current state, for example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">patched</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">merged</span></samp>&rsquo;, <small class="dots">...</small>

     <li>An asterisk when the file is <dfn>marked</dfn> (see <a href="#Selected-files">Selected files</a>).

     <li>The actual status of the file wrt the repository.  See below.

     <li>Optionally, the base revision of the file.  This is the version
which the copy in your working directory is based upon.

     <li>The file name.

   </ul>

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file status</span></samp>&rsquo; field can have the following values:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Modified</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file is modified in your working directory, and there was no
modification to the same file in the repository.  This status can have
the following substatus:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">merged</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file was modified in your working directory, and there were
modifications in the repository as well, but they were merged
successfully, without conflict, in your working directory. 
</dl>

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Conflict</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes to <var>file</var>
with changes from the repository.  <var>file</var> (the copy in your
working directory) is now the output of the <code>rcsmerge</code> command on
the two versions; an unmodified copy of your file is also in your
working directory, with the name <samp><span class="file">.#</span><var>file</var><span class="file">.</span><var>version</var></samp>,
where <var>version</var> is the RCS revision that your modified file started
from.  See <a href="#Viewing-differences">Viewing differences</a>, for more details.

     <p>A conflict can also come from a disagreement on the existence of the file
rather than on its content.  This case is indicated by the following
possible substatus:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">removed</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file is locally removed but a new revision has been committed to
the repository by someone else.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">added</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file is locally added and has also been added to the repository
by someone else.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">modified</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file is locally modified but someone else has removed it from the
repository. 
</dl>

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Added</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file has been added by you, but it still needs to be checked in to
the repository.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Removed</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file has been removed by you, but it still needs to be checked in to
the repository.  You can resurrect it by typing <kbd>a</kbd> (see <a href="#Adding-and-removing-files">Adding and removing files</a>).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Unknown</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A file that was detected in your directory, but that neither appears in
the repository, nor is present on the list of files that CVS should
ignore.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up-to-date</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file is up to date with respect to the version in the repository. 
This status can have a substatus of:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">added</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>You have just added the file to the repository.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">updated</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file was brought up to date with respect to the repository.  This is
done for any file that exists in the repository but not in your source,
and for files that you haven't changed but are not the most recent
versions available in the repository.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">patched</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file was brought up to date with respect to the remote repository by
way of fetching and applying a patch to the file in your source.  This
is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">updated</span></samp>&rsquo; except that CVS decided to use a hopefully
more efficient method.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">committed</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>You just committed the file. 
</dl>

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Need-Update</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Either a newer version than the one in your source is available in the
repository and you have not modified your checked out version, or the
file exists in the repository but not in your source.  Use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs-mode-update</span></samp>&rsquo; bound to <kbd>O</kbd> to update the file.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Need-Merge</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>You have modified the checked out version of the file, and a newer
version is available in the repository.  A merge will take place when
you run a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs-update</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Missing</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file has been unexpectedly removed from your working directory
although it has not been &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs remove</span></samp>&rsquo;d.

which can be either the set of marked files (if any file is marked and
marks are not ignored) or whichever file or directory the cursor is on.

   <p>If a directory is selected but the command cannot be applied to a
directory, then it will be applied to the set of files under this
directory which are in the <samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp> buffer.

   <p><a name="index-cvs_002dmode_002dforce_002dcommand-14"></a><a name="index-cvs_002dallow_002ddir_002dcommit-15"></a>Furthermore, each command only operates on a subset of the selected
files, depending on whether or not the command is <dfn>applicable</dfn> to
each file (based on the file's status).  For example,
<code>cvs-mode-commit</code> is not applicable to a file whose status is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Need-Update</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If it should happen that PCL-CVS guesses the
applicability wrong, you can override it with the special prefix
<code>cvs-mode-force-command</code> normally bound to <kbd>M-f</kbd> (and file a
bug report).  The applicability rule can be slightly changed with
<code>cvs-allow-dir-commit</code> and <code>cvs-force-dir-tag</code>.

   <p>By default, marks are always in effect (you may change this, however, by
setting the variable <code>cvs-default-ignore-marks</code>) except for the
commands that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tag</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">diff</span></samp>&rsquo; a file (which can be changed
with the variable <code>cvs-invert-ignore-marks</code>).

   <p>In addition, you may use the special prefix <code>cvs-mode-toggle-marks</code>
normally bound to &lt;T&gt; to toggle the use of marks for the following
command.

   <p>This scheme might seem a little complicated, but once one gets used to
it, it is quite powerful.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Entering PCL-CVS</h3>

<p><a name="index-cvs_002dupdate-16"></a><a name="index-cvs_002dexamine-17"></a><a name="index-cvs_002dstatus-18"></a><a name="index-cvs_002dcheckout-19"></a><a name="index-cvs_002dquickdir-20"></a><a name="index-Creating-the-_002acvs_002a-buffer-21"></a>
Most commands in PCL-CVS require that you have a <samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp>
buffer.  The commands that you use to get one are listed below. 
For each, a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs</span></samp>&rsquo; process will be run, the output will be parsed by
PCL-CVS, and the result will be printed in the <samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp> buffer (see
<a href="#Buffer-contents">Buffer contents</a>, for a description of the buffer's contents).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x cvs-update</kbd><dd>Run a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs update</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  You will be asked for the directory
in which the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs update</span></samp>&rsquo; will be run.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x cvs-examine</kbd><dd>Run a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs -n update</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  This is identical to the previous
command, except that it will only check what needs to be done but will
not change anything.  You will be asked for the directory in
which the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs -n update</span></samp>&rsquo; will be run.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x cvs-status</kbd><dd>Run a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs status</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  You will be asked for the directory
in which the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs status</span></samp>&rsquo; will be run.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x cvs-checkout</kbd><dd>Run a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs checkout</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  You will be asked for the directory
in which the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs update</span></samp>&rsquo; will be run and the module to be checked
out.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x cvs-quickdir</kbd><dd>Populate the <samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp> buffer by just looking at the <samp><span class="file">CVS/Entries</span></samp>
files.  This is very much like <code>cvs-examine</code> except that it does
not access the CVS repository, which is a major advantage when the
repository is far away.  But of course, it will not be able to detect
when a file needs to be updated or merged. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-cvs_002ddired_002daction-22"></a><a name="index-cvs_002ddired_002duse_002dhook-23"></a>The first four of
those commands are also reachable from the menu bar
under &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Tools-&gt;PCL-CVS</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Finally, an alternative way is to visit
the CVS administrative subdirectory in your work area with a simple
prefix argument.  For example <kbd>C-u C-x C-f ~/my/work/CVS &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  This
by default runs <code>cvs-quickdir</code> but the specific behavior can be
changed with <code>cvs-dired-action</code> and <code>cvs-dired-use-hook</code>.

   <p>By default, the commands above will descend recursively into
subdirectories.  You can avoid that behavior by including &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; in
the flags for the command.  These flags can be set by giving a prefix
argument to the command (e.g., by typing
<kbd>C-u M-x cvs-update &lt;RET&gt; -l &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>).

<h3 class="section">5.2 Setting flags for CVS commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-Optional-switches-to-CVS-24"></a><a name="index-Command_002dline-options-to-CVS-25"></a>
This section describes the convention used by nearly all PCL-CVS
commands for setting optional flags sent to CVS.  A single <kbd>C-u</kbd>
prefix argument is used to cause the command to prompt for flags to be
used for the current invocation of the command only.  Two <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix
arguments are used to prompt for flags which will be set permanently, for the
current invocation and all that follow, until the flags are changed, or
unless temporary flags are set which override them.

   <p>Perhaps an example or two is in order.  Say you are about to add a
binary file to the repository, and want to specify the flags &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-kb</span></samp>&rsquo;
to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs add</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You can type <kbd>C-u a -kb &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>,
and the file will be added.  Subsequent &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs add</span></samp>&rsquo;
commands will use the previously prevailing flags.

   <p>As a second example, say you are about to perform a diff and want to see
the result in unified diff format, i.e., you'd like to pass the flag
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-u</span></samp>&rsquo; to both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs diff</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">diff</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You'd also like all
subsequent diffs to use this flag.  You can type <kbd>C-u C-u = -u &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
and the diff will be performed, and the default flags will be set to
<code>("-u")</code>.  You can of course override this flag for a single diff
by using a single <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix argument.

   <p><a name="index-Special-prefix-26"></a>In addition to this, some commands can take <dfn>special prefix</dfn> arguments. 
These work as follows: When called with a <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix, the user is
prompted for a new value of the special prefix and the special prefix is
activated for the next command.  When called without the <kbd>C-u</kbd>
prefix, the special prefix is re-activated (with the same value as last
time) for the next command.  Calling the prefix command again when it's
already activated deactivates it.  Calling it with the <kbd>C-u C-u</kbd>
prefix activates it for all subsequent commands until you deactivate it
explicitly.  The special prefixes are:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>T</kbd><dd>Toggles whether or not marks will be active in the next command.

     <br><dt><kbd>b</kbd><dd>Provide the next command with a branch (can be any version
specifier) to work on.

     <br><dt><kbd>B</kbd><dd>Secondary branch argument.  Only meaningful if <kbd>b</kbd> is also used. 
It can be used to provide a second branch argument to
<code>cvs-mode-diff</code> or to <code>cvs-mode-update</code>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-f</kbd><dd>Forces the next command to apply to every selected file rather than only
to the ones PCL-CVS thinks are relevant.

The following commands can be used from within the <samp><span class="file">*cvs*</span></samp> buffer
to update the display:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-u</kbd><dd>Runs the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs-update</span></samp>&rsquo;.

</dl>

   <p>In addition to the above commands which operate on the whole module,
you can run the equivalent CVS command on just a subset of the
files/directories with these keys:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>O</kbd><dd>Runs <code>cvs-mode-update</code> on the selected files.  When run on the
top-level directory, this is equivalent to <kbd>M-u</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>e</kbd><dd>Runs <code>cvs-mode-examine</code> on the selected files.  When run on the

You can use most normal Emacs commands to move forward and backward in
the buffer.  Some keys are rebound to functions that take advantage of
the fact that the buffer is a PCL-CVS buffer:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>These keys move the cursor one file forward, towards the end of the
buffer (<code>cvs-mode-next-line</code>).

PCL-CVS works on a set of <dfn>selected files</dfn> (see <a href="#Selected-files">Selected files</a>). 
You can mark and unmark files with these commands:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>m</kbd><dd>This marks the file that the cursor is positioned on.  If the cursor is
positioned on a directory all files in that directory are marked
(<code>cvs-mode-mark</code>).

Committing changes basically works as follows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>After having selected the files you want to commit, you type either
<kbd>c</kbd> or <kbd>C</kbd> which brings up a special buffer
<samp><span class="file">*cvs-commit*</span></samp>.

     <li>You type in the log message describing the changes you're about to
commit (see <a href="#Log-Edit-Mode">Log Edit Mode</a>).

     <li>When you're happy with it, you type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to do the actual
commit.
        </ol>

   <p>There's no hidden state, so you can abort the process or pick it up
again at any time.

   <p><a name="index-log_002dedit_002dconfirm_0040r_007b-_0028variable_0029_007d-68"></a>The set of files actually committed is really decided only during the
very last step, which is a mixed blessing.  It allows you to go back and
change your mind about which files to commit, but it also means that you
might inadvertently change the set of selected files.  To reduce the
risk of error, <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> will ask for confirmation if the set of
selected files has changed between the first step and the last.  You can
change this last detail with <code>log-edit-confirm</code>.

   <p>As for the difference between <kbd>c</kbd> (i.e., <code>cvs-mode-commit</code>) and
<kbd>C</kbd> (i.e., <code>cvs-mode-commit-setup</code>) is that the first gets you
straight to <samp><span class="file">*cvs-commit*</span></samp> without erasing it or changing anything
to its content, while the second first erases <samp><span class="file">*cvs-commit*</span></samp>
and tries to initialize it with a sane default (it does that by either
using a template provided by the CVS administrator or by extracting a
relevant log message from a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file).

   <p>If you are editing the files in your Emacs, an automatic
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">revert-buffer</span></samp>&rsquo; will be performed.  (If the file contains
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$Id$</span></samp>&rsquo; keywords, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs commit</span></samp>&rsquo; will write a new file with
the new values substituted.  The auto-revert makes sure that you get
them into your buffer.)  The revert will not occur if you have modified
your buffer, or if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs-auto-revert</span></samp>&rsquo; is set to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nil</span></samp>&rsquo;.

There are currently three commands that can be used to find a file (that
is, load it into a buffer and start editing it there).  These commands
work on the line that the cursor is situated at.  They always ignore any marked
files.

     <dl>

<p><a name="index-Log-Edit-mode-167"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Log-Edit-168"></a>Buffers for entering/editing log messages for changes which are about
to be committed are put into Log Edit mode.

   <p>Sometimes the log buffer contains default text when you enter it,
typically the last log message entered.  If it does, mark and point
are set around the entire contents of the buffer so that it is easy to
kill the contents of the buffer with <kbd>C-w</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-log_002dedit_002dinsert_002dchangelog-169"></a>If you work by writing entries in the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>
(see <a href="emacs.html#Change-Log">Change Log</a>) and then commit the change under revision
control, you can generate the Log Edit text from the ChangeLog using
<kbd>C-c C-a</kbd> (<kbd>log-edit-insert-changelog</kbd>).  This looks for
entries for the file(s) concerned in the top entry in the ChangeLog
and uses those paragraphs as the log text.  This text is only inserted
if the top entry was made under your user name on the current date. 
See <a href="emacs.html#Change-Logs-and-VC">Change Logs and VC</a>, for the opposite way of
working&mdash;generating ChangeLog entries from the revision control log.

   <p>In the Log Edit buffer, <kbd>C-c C-f</kbd> (<kbd>M-x log-edit-show-files</kbd>)
shows the list of files to be committed in case you need to check
that.

   <p>When you have finished editing the log message, type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to
exit the buffer and commit the change.

<a name="index-cvs_002dmode_002dlog-173"></a><a name="index-vc_002dprint_002dlog-174"></a>Log View mode provides a few useful commands for navigating revision
control log output.  It is used for the output buffers of both
<code>cvs-mode-log</code> and <code>vc-print-log</code>.

   <p>In this mode, <kbd>n</kbd> goes to the next message and <kbd>p</kbd> goes to the
previous message and <kbd>N</kbd> and <kbd>P</kbd> go to the next and previous
files, respectively, in multi-file output.  With a numeric prefix
argument, these commands move that many messages of files.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs-auto-remove-directories</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If this variable is set to any non-<code>nil</code> value, directories that do

This variable defaults to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;. See <a href="#Committing-changes">Committing changes</a>.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs-update-prog-output-skip-regexp</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-u</span></samp>&rsquo; flag in the <samp><span class="file">modules</span></samp> file can be used to run a command
whenever a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs update</span></samp>&rsquo; is performed (see <code>cvs(5)</code>).  This regexp
is used to search for the last line in that output.  It is normally set
to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;.  That setting is only correct if the command outputs
nothing.  Note that PCL-CVS will get very confused if the command
outputs <em>anything</em> to <code>stderr</code>.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs-cvsroot</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This variable can be set to override &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CVSROOT</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It should be a
string.  If it is set, then every time a <code>cvs</code> command is run, it
will be called as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs -d </span><var>cvs-cvsroot</var><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This can be
useful if your site has several repositories.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">log-edit-require-final-newline</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><!-- wordy to avoid underfull hbox -->
When you enter a log message by typing into the
<samp><span class="file">*cvs-commit-message*</span></samp> buffer, PCL-CVS normally automatically
inserts a trailing newline, unless there already is one.  This behavior
can be controlled via &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs-commit-buffer-require-final-newline</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If it is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo; (the default behavior), a newline will always be
appended.  If it is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nil</span></samp>&rsquo;, newlines will never be appended.  Any
other value causes PCL-CVS to ask the user whenever there is no trailing
newline in the commit message buffer.

paragraphs in the CVS log created by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs-mode-changelog-commit</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
This may be set in the local variables section of a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>
file, to indicate the policy for that <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bChangeLog_007d-paragraphs-201"></a>A <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp><dfn> paragraph</dfn> is a bunch of log text containing no
blank lines; a paragraph usually describes a set of changes with a
single purpose, but perhaps spanning several functions in several files. 
Changes in different paragraphs are unrelated.

     <p>You could argue that the CVS log entry for a file should contain the
full <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> paragraph mentioning the change to the file, even though
it may mention other files, because that gives you the full context you
need to understand the change.  This is the behavior you get when this
variable is set to <code>t</code>, the default.

     <p>On the other hand, you could argue that the CVS log entry for a change
should contain only the text for the changes which occurred in that
file, because the CVS log is per-file.  This is the behavior you get
when this variable is set to <code>nil</code>.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License</h2>

<!-- The GNU Free Documentation License. -->
<div align="center">Version 1.3, 3 November 2008</div>

<!-- This file is intended to be included within another document, -->
<!-- hence no sectioning command or @node. -->
<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
