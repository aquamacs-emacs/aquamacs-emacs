  <h2 class="chapter">1 How Mail Works</h2><a name="index-SMTP" id=
  "index-SMTP"></a> <a name="index-MTA" id="index-MTA"></a>

  <p>On the internet, mail is sent from mail host to mail host
  using the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP). To send and
  receive mail, you must get it from and send it to a mail host.
  Every mail host runs a mail transfer agent (MTA) such as Exim
  that accepts mails and passes them on. The communication between
  a mail host and other clients does not necessarily involve SMTP,
  however. Here is short overview of what is involved.</p><a name=
  "index-MUA" id="index-MUA"></a>

  <p>The mail program&mdash;also called a mail user agent
  (MUA)&mdash;usually sends outgoing mail to a mail host. When your
  computer is permanently connected to the internet, it might even
  be a mail host itself. In this case, the MUA will pipe mail to
  the <samp>/usr/lib/sendmail</samp> application. It will take care
  of your mail and pass it on to the next mail host.</p><a name=
  "index-ISP" id="index-ISP"></a>

  <p>When you are only connected to the internet from time to time,
  your internet service provider (ISP) has probably told you which
  mail host to use. You must configure your MUA to use that mail
  host. Since you are reading this manual, you probably want to
  configure Emacs to use SMTP to send mail to that mail host. More
  on that in the next section.</p><a name="index-MDA" id=
  "index-MDA"></a>

  <p>Things are different when reading mail. The mail host
  responsible for your mail keeps it in a file somewhere. The
  messages get into the file by way of a mail delivery agent (MDA)
  such as procmail. These delivery agents often allow you to filter
  and munge your mails before you get to see it. When your computer
  is that mail host, this file is called a spool, and sometimes
  located in the directory <samp>/var/spool/mail/</samp>. All your
  MUA has to do is read mail from the spool, then.</p><a name=
  "index-POP3" id="index-POP3"></a> <a name="index-IMAP" id=
  "index-IMAP"></a>

  <p>When your computer is not always connected to the internet,
  you must get the mail from the remote mail host using a protocol
  such as POP3 or IMAP. POP3 essentially downloads all your mail
  from the mail host to your computer. The mail is stored in some
  file on your computer, and again, all your MUA has to do is read
  mail from the spool.</p>

  <p>When you read mail from various machines, downloading mail
  from the mail host to your current machine is not convenient. In
  that case, you will probably want to use the IMAP protocol. Your
  mail is kept on the mail host, and you can read it while you are
  connected via IMAP to the mail host.</p><a name="index-Webmail"
  id="index-Webmail"></a>

  <p>So how does reading mail via the web work, you ask. In that
  case, the web interface just allows you to remote-control a MUA
  on the web host. Whether the web host is also a mail host, and
  how all the pieces interact is completely irrelevant. You usually
  cannot use Emacs to read mail via the web, unless you use
  software that parses the ever-changing HTML of the web
  interface.</p>
