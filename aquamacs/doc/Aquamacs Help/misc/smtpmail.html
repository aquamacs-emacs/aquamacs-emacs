<h2 class="chapter">1 How Mail Works</h2>

<p><a name="index-SMTP-1"></a><a name="index-MTA-2"></a>   On the internet, mail is sent from mail host to mail host using the
simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP).  To send and receive mail, you
must get it from and send it to a mail host.  Every mail host runs a
mail transfer agent (MTA) such as Exim that accepts mails and passes
them on.  The communication between a mail host and other clients does
not necessarily involve SMTP, however.  Here is short overview of what
is involved.

   <p><a name="index-MUA-3"></a>   The mail program&mdash;also called a mail user agent (MUA)&mdash;usually
sends outgoing mail to a mail host.  When your computer is
permanently connected to the internet, it might even be a mail host
itself.  In this case, the MUA will pipe mail to the
<samp><span class="file">/usr/lib/sendmail</span></samp> application.  It will take care of your mail
and pass it on to the next mail host.

   <p><a name="index-ISP-4"></a>   When you are only connected to the internet from time to time, your
internet service provider (ISP) has probably told you which mail host
to use.  You must configure your MUA to use that mail host.  Since you
are reading this manual, you probably want to configure Emacs to use
SMTP to send mail to that mail host.  More on that in the next
section.

   <p><a name="index-MDA-5"></a>   Things are different when reading mail.  The mail host responsible
for your mail keeps it in a file somewhere.  The messages get into the
file by way of a mail delivery agent (MDA) such as procmail.  These
delivery agents often allow you to filter and munge your mails before
you get to see it.  When your computer is that mail host, this file is
called a spool, and sometimes located in the directory
<samp><span class="file">/var/spool/mail/</span></samp>.  All your MUA has to do is read mail from the
spool, then.

   <p><a name="index-POP3-6"></a><a name="index-IMAP-7"></a>   When your computer is not always connected to the internet, you
must get the mail from the remote mail host using a protocol such as
POP3 or IMAP.  POP3 essentially downloads all your mail from the mail
host to your computer.  The mail is stored in some file on your
computer, and again, all your MUA has to do is read mail from the
spool.

   <p>When you read mail from various machines, downloading mail from the
mail host to your current machine is not convenient.  In that case,
you will probably want to use the IMAP protocol.  Your mail is kept on
the mail host, and you can read it while you are connected via IMAP to
the mail host.

   <p><a name="index-Webmail-8"></a>   So how does reading mail via the web work, you ask.  In that case,
the web interface just allows you to remote-control a MUA on the web
host.  Whether the web host is also a mail host, and how all the
pieces interact is completely irrelevant.  You usually cannot use
Emacs to read mail via the web, unless you use software that parses
the ever-changing HTML of the web interface.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Emacs Speaks SMTP</h2>

<p>Emacs includes a package for sending your mail to a SMTP server and
have it take care of delivering it to the final destination, rather
than letting the MTA on your local system take care of it.  This can
be useful if you don't have a MTA set up on your host, or if your
machine is often disconnected from the internet.

   <p>Sending mail via SMTP requires configuring your mail user agent
(see <a href="emacs.html#Mail-Methods">Mail Methods</a>) to use the SMTP library.  If you
have not configured anything, then in Emacs 24.1 and later the first
time you try to send a mail Emacs will ask how you want to send
mail.  To use this library, answer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">smtp</span></samp>&rsquo; when prompted.  Emacs
then asks for the name of the SMTP server.

   <p>If you prefer, or if you are using a non-standard mail user agent,
you can configure this yourself.  The normal way to do this is to set
the variable <code>send-mail-function</code> (see <a href="emacs.html#Mail-Sending">Mail Sending</a>) to the value you want to use.  To use this library:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The default value for this variable is <code>sendmail-query-once</code>,
which interactively asks how you want to send mail.

   <p>Your mail user agent might use a different variable for this purpose. 
It should inherit from <code>send-mail-function</code>, but if it does not,
or if you prefer, you can set that variable directly.  Consult your
mail user agent's documentation for more details.  For example,
(see <a href="message.html#Mail-Variables">Mail Variables</a>).

   <p>Before using SMTP you must find out the hostname of the SMTP server
to use.  Your system administrator or mail service provider should
supply this information.  Often it is some variant of the server you
receive mail from.  If your email address is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">yourname@example.com</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the name of the SMTP server is
may be something like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">smtp.example.com</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <dl>
<dt><code>smtpmail-smtp-server</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002dsmtp_002dserver-9"></a><a name="index-SMTPSERVER-10"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-smtp-server</code> controls the hostname of
the server to use.  It is a string with an IP address or hostname.  It
defaults to the contents of the <samp><span class="env">SMTPSERVER</span></samp> environment
variable, or, if empty, the contents of
<code>smtpmail-default-smtp-server</code>.

     <br><dt><code>smtpmail-default-smtp-server</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002ddefault_002dsmtp_002dserver-11"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-default-smtp-server</code> controls the
default hostname of the server to use.  It is a string with an IP
address or hostname.  It must be set before the SMTP library is
loaded.  It has no effect if set after the SMTP library has been
loaded, or if <code>smtpmail-smtp-server</code> is defined.  It is usually
set by system administrators in a site wide initialization file. 
</dl>

   <p>The following example illustrates what you could put in
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> to set the SMTP server name.

<pre class="example">     ;; Send mail using SMTP via mail.example.org.
     (setq smtpmail-smtp-server "mail.example.org")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Mail-Submission-12"></a>SMTP is normally used on the registered &ldquo;smtp&rdquo; TCP service port 25. 
Some environments use SMTP in &ldquo;Mail Submission&rdquo; mode, which uses
port 587.  Using other ports is not uncommon, either for security by
obscurity purposes, port forwarding, or otherwise.

     <dl>
<dt><code>smtpmail-smtp-service</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002dsmtp_002dservice-13"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-smtp-service</code> controls the port on the
server to contact.  It is either a string, in which case it will be
translated into an integer using system calls, or an integer. 
</dl>

   <p>The following example illustrates what you could put in
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> to set the SMTP service port.

<pre class="example">     ;; Send mail using SMTP on the mail submission port 587.
     (setq smtpmail-smtp-service 587)

<h2 class="chapter">3 Authentication</h2>

<p><a name="index-password-14"></a><a name="index-user-name-15"></a>Most SMTP servers require clients to authenticate themselves before
they are allowed to send mail.  Authentication usually involves
supplying a user name and password.

   <p>If you have not configured anything, then the first time you try to
send mail via a server, Emacs (version 24.1 and later) prompts you
for the user name and password to use, and then offers to save the
information.  By default, Emacs stores authentication information in
a file <samp><span class="file">~/.authinfo</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-authinfo-16"></a>The basic format of the <samp><span class="file">~/.authinfo</span></samp> file is one line for each
set of credentials.  Each line consists of pairs of variables and
values.  A simple example would be:

<pre class="smallexample">     machine mail.example.org port 25 login myuser password mypassword
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This specifies that when using the SMTP server called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mail.example.org</span></samp>&rsquo;
on port 25, Emacs should send the user name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myuser</span></samp>&rsquo; and the
password &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mypassword</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Either or both of the login and password
fields may be absent, in which case Emacs prompts for the information
when you try to send mail.  (This replaces the old
<code>smtpmail-auth-credentials</code> variable used prior to Emacs 24.1.)

   <p><a name="index-smtpmail_002dsmtp_002duser-17"></a>  When the SMTP library connects to a host on a certain port, it
searches the <samp><span class="file">~/.authinfo</span></samp> file for a matching entry.  If an
entry is found, the authentication process is invoked and the
credentials are used.  If the variable <code>smtpmail-smtp-user</code> is
set to a non-<code>nil</code> value, then only entries for that user are
considered.  For more information on the <samp><span class="file">~/.authinfo</span></samp>
file, see <a href="auth.html#Top">auth-source</a>.

   <p><a name="index-SASL-18"></a><a name="index-CRAM_002dMD5-19"></a><a name="index-PLAIN-20"></a><a name="index-LOGIN-21"></a>The process by which the SMTP library authenticates you to the server
is known as &ldquo;Simple Authentication and Security Layer&rdquo; (SASL). 
There are various SASL mechanisms, and this library supports three of
them: CRAM-MD5, PLAIN, and LOGIN.  It tries each of them, in that order,
until one succeeds.  The first uses a form of encryption to obscure
your password, while the other two do not.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Encryption</h2>

<p><a name="index-STARTTLS-22"></a><a name="index-TLS-23"></a><a name="index-SSL-24"></a>For greater security, you can encrypt your connection to the SMTP
server.  If this is to work, both Emacs and the server must support it.

   <p>The SMTP library supports the &ldquo;Transport Layer Security&rdquo; (TLS), and
the older &ldquo;Secure Sockets Layer&rdquo; (SSL) encryption mechanisms. 
It also supports STARTTLS, which is a variant of TLS in which the
initial connection to the server is made in plain text, requesting a
switch to an encrypted channel for the rest of the process.

   <p><a name="index-smtpmail_002dstream_002dtype-25"></a>The variable <code>smtpmail-stream-type</code> controls what form of
connection the SMTP library uses.  The default value is <code>nil</code>,
which means to use a plain connection, but try to switch to a STARTTLS
encrypted connection if the server supports it.  Other possible values
are: <code>starttls</code> to insist on STARTTLS; <code>ssl</code> to use TLS/SSL;
and <code>plain</code> for encryption.

   <p>Use of any form of TLS/SSL requires support in Emacs.  You can either
use the built-in support (in Emacs 24.1 and later), or the
<samp><span class="file">starttls.el</span></samp> Lisp library.  The built-in support uses the GnuTLS
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> library. 
If your Emacs has GnuTLS support built-in, the function
<code>gnutls-available-p</code> is defined and returns non-<code>nil</code>. 
Otherwise, you must use the <samp><span class="file">starttls.el</span></samp> library (see that file for
more information on customization options, etc.).  The Lisp library
requires one of the following external tools to be installed:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The GnuTLS command line tool &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnutls-cli</span></samp>&rsquo;, which you can get from
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/</a>.  This is the recommended
tool, mainly because it can verify server certificates.

     <li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">starttls</span></samp>&rsquo; external program, which you can get from
<samp><span class="file">starttls-*.tar.gz</span></samp> from <a href="ftp://ftp.opaopa.org/pub/elisp/">ftp://ftp.opaopa.org/pub/elisp/</a>.
        </ol>

   <p><a name="index-certificates-26"></a><a name="index-keys-27"></a>The SMTP server may also request that you verify your identity by
sending a certificate and the associated encryption key to the server. 
If you need to do this, you can use an <samp><span class="file">~/.authinfo</span></samp> entry like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     machine mail.example.org port 25 key "~/.my_smtp_tls.key" cert "~/.my_smtp_tls.cert"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(This replaces the old <code>smtpmail-starttls-credentials</code> variable used
prior to Emacs 24.1.)

<h2 class="chapter">5 Queued delivery</h2>

<p><a name="index-Dialup-connection-28"></a>If you connect to the internet via a dialup connection, or for some
other reason don't have permanent internet connection, sending mail
will fail when you are not connected.  The SMTP library implements
queued delivery, and the following variable control its behavior.

     <dl>
<dt><code>smtpmail-queue-mail</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002dqueue_002dmail-29"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-queue-mail</code> controls whether a simple
off line mail sender is active.  This variable is a boolean, and
defaults to <code>nil</code> (disabled).  If this is non-<code>nil</code>, mail is
not sent immediately but rather queued in the directory
<code>smtpmail-queue-dir</code> and can be later sent manually by invoking
<code>smtpmail-send-queued-mail</code> (typically when you connect to the
internet).

     <br><dt><code>smtpmail-queue-dir</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002dqueue_002ddir-30"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-queue-dir</code> specifies the name of the
directory to hold queued messages.  It defaults to
<samp><span class="file">~/Mail/queued-mail/</span></samp>. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-smtpmail_002dsend_002dqueued_002dmail-31"></a>  The function <code>smtpmail-send-queued-mail</code> can be used to send
any queued mail when <code>smtpmail-queue-mail</code> is enabled.  It is
typically invoked interactively with <kbd>M-x
smtpmail-send-queued-mail RET</kbd> when you are connected to the internet.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Server workarounds</h2>

<p>Some SMTP servers have special requirements.  The following variables
implement support for common requirements.

     <dl>
<dt><code>smtpmail-local-domain</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002dlocal_002ddomain-32"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-local-domain</code> controls the hostname sent
in the first <code>EHLO</code> or <code>HELO</code> command sent to the server. 
It should be set only if the <code>system-name</code> function returns a
name that isn't accepted by the server.  Do not set this variable
unless your server complains.

     <br><dt><code>smtpmail-sendto-domain</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002dsendto_002ddomain-33"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-sendto-domain</code> makes the SMTP library
add &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; and the specified value to recipients specified in the
message when they are sent using the <code>RCPT TO</code> command.  Some
configurations of sendmail requires this behavior.  Don't bother to
set this unless you have get an error like:

     <pre class="example">                  Sending failed; SMTP protocol error
</pre>
     <p>when sending mail, and the debug buffer (see <a href="#Debugging">Debugging</a>)) contains
an error such as:

     <pre class="example">                  RCPT TO: <var>someone</var>
                  501 <var>someone</var>: recipient address must contain a domain
</pre>

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">7 Debugging</h2>

<p>Sometimes delivery fails, often with the generic error message
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Sending failed; SMTP protocol error</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Enabling one or both of
the following variables and inspecting a trace buffer will often give
clues to the reason for the error.

     <dl>
<dt><code>smtpmail-debug-info</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002ddebug_002dinfo-34"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-debug-info</code> controls whether to print
the SMTP protocol exchange in the minibuffer, and retain the entire
exchange in a buffer <samp><span class="file">*trace of SMTP session to </span><var>server</var><span class="file">*</span></samp>,
where <var>server</var> is the name of the mail server to which you send
mail.

     <br><dt><code>smtpmail-debug-verb</code><dd><a name="index-smtpmail_002ddebug_002dverb-35"></a>  The variable <code>smtpmail-debug-verb</code> controls whether to send the
<code>VERB</code> token to the server.  The <code>VERB</code> server instructs the
server to be more verbose, and often also to attempt final delivery
while your SMTP session is still running.  It is usually only useful
together with <code>smtpmail-debug-info</code>.  Note that this may cause
mail delivery to take considerable time if the final destination
cannot accept mail.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
