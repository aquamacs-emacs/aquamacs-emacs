  <p>With only the <kbd>n</kbd> (next), <kbd>p</kbd> (previous),

  commands for moving between nodes, nodes are restricted to a
  linear sequence. Menus allow a branching structure. A menu is a
  list of other nodes you can move to. It is actually just part of
  the text of the node formatted specially so that Info can
  interpret it. The beginning of a menu is always identified by a
  line which starts with &lsquo;<samp>*&nbsp;Menu:</samp>&rsquo; 
  <!-- /@w -->. A node contains a menu if and only if it has a line
  in it which starts that way. The only menu you can use at any
  moment is the one in the node you are in. To use a menu in any
  other node, you must move to that node first.</p>

  <p>After the start of the menu, each line that starts with a
  &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; identifies one subtopic. The line
  usually contains a brief name for the subtopic (followed by a
  &lsquo;<samp>:</samp>&rsquo;, normally hidden in Emacs), the name
  of the node that talks about that subtopic (again, normally
  hidden in Emacs), and optionally some further description of the
  subtopic. Lines in the menu that do not start with a
  &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; have no special meaning&mdash;they
  are only for the human reader&rsquo;s benefit and do not define
  additional subtopics. Here is an example:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
* Foo:  Node about FOO.      This tells about FOO.
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The subtopic name is Foo, and the node describing it is
  &lsquo;<samp>Node about FOO</samp>&rsquo;. The rest of the line
  is just for the reader&rsquo;s Information. [[ But this line is
  not a real menu item, simply because there is no line above it
  which starts with &lsquo;<samp>*&nbsp;Menu:</samp>&rsquo; 
  <!-- /@w -->. Also, in a real menu item, the
  &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; would appear at the very start of
  the line. This is why the &ldquo;normally hidden&rdquo; text in
  Emacs, namely &lsquo;<samp>: Node about FOO.</samp>&rsquo;, is
  actually visible in this example, even when Visible mode is
  off.]]</p>

  <p>When you use a menu to go to another node (in a way that will
  be described soon), what you specify is the subtopic name, the
  first thing in the menu line. Info uses it to find the menu line,
  extracts the node name from it, and goes to that node. The reason
  that there is both a subtopic name and a node name is that the
  node name must be meaningful to the computer and may therefore
  have to be ugly looking. The subtopic name can be chosen just to
  be convenient for the user to specify. Often the node name is
  convenient for the user to specify and so both it and the
  subtopic name are the same. There is an abbreviation for
  this:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
* Foo::   This tells about FOO.
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This means that the subtopic name and node name are the same;
  they are both &lsquo;<samp>Foo</samp>&rsquo;. (The
  &lsquo;<samp>::</samp>&rsquo; is normally hidden in Emacs.)</p>

  <div class="format">
    <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Now use <tt class=
"key">SPC</tt> to find the menu in this node, then come back to
   the front with a <kbd>b</kbd> and some <tt class=
"key">SPC</tt>s.  As you see, a menu is
   actually visible in its node.  If you cannot find a menu in a node
   by looking at it, then the node does not have a menu and the
   <kbd>m</kbd> command is not available.
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>If you keep typing <tt class="key">SPC</tt> once the menu
  appears on the screen, it will move to another node (the first
  one in the menu). If that happens, type <tt class=
  "key">BACKSPACE</tt> to come back.</p><a name=
  "index-m-_0028Info-mode_0029" id=
  "index-m-_0028Info-mode_0029"></a>

  <p>The command to go to one of the subnodes is <kbd>m</kbd>. This
  is very different from the commands you have used: it is a
  command that prompts you for more input.</p>

  <p>The Info commands you know do not need additional input; when
  you type one of them, Info processes it instantly and then is
  ready for another command. The <kbd>m</kbd> command is different:
  it needs to know the <em>name of the subtopic</em>. Once you have
  typed <kbd>m</kbd>, Info tries to read the subtopic name.</p>

  <p>Now, in the stand-alone Info, look for the line containing
  many dashes near the bottom of the screen. (This is the
  stand-alone equivalent for the mode line in Emacs.) There is one
  more line beneath that one, but usually it is blank. (In Emacs,
  this is the echo area.) When it is blank, Info is ready for a
  command, such as <kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>b</kbd> or <tt class=
  "key">SPC</tt> or <kbd>m</kbd>. If that line contains text ending
  in a colon, it means Info is reading more input for the last
  command. You can&rsquo;t type an Info command then, because Info
  is trying to read input, not commands. You must either give the
  input and finish the command you started, or type
  <kbd>Control-g</kbd> to cancel the command. When you have done
  one of those things, the input entry line becomes blank again.
  Then you can type Info commands again.</p><a name=
  "index-Info_002dmenu" id="index-Info_002dmenu"></a>

  <p>The command to go to a subnode via a menu is <kbd>m</kbd>.
  After you type the <kbd>m</kbd>, the line at the bottom of the
  screen says &lsquo;<samp>Menu item:</samp> &rsquo;. You must then
  type the name of the subtopic you want, and end it with a
  <tt class="key">RET</tt>.</p><a name=
  "index-abbreviating-Info-subnodes" id=
  "index-abbreviating-Info-subnodes"></a>

  <p>You can abbreviate the subtopic name. If the abbreviation is
  not unique, the first matching subtopic is chosen. Some menus put
  the shortest possible abbreviation for each subtopic name in
  capital letters, so you can see how much you need to type. It
  does not matter whether you use upper case or lower case when you
  type the subtopic. You should not put any spaces at the end, or
  inside of the item name, except for one space where a space
  appears in the item in the menu.</p><a name=
  "index-completion-of-Info-node-names" id=
  "index-completion-of-Info-node-names"></a>

  <p>You can also use the <em>completion</em> feature to help enter
  the subtopic name. If you type the <tt class="key">TAB</tt> key
  after entering part of a name, it will fill in more of the
  name&mdash;as much as Info can deduce from the part you have
  entered.</p>

  <p>If you move the cursor to one of the menu subtopic lines, then
  you do not need to type the argument: you just type a <tt class=
  "key">RET</tt>, and it stands for the subtopic of the line you
  are on. You can also click the middle mouse button directly on
  the subtopic line to go there.</p>

  <p>Here is a menu to give you a chance to practice. This menu
  gives you three ways of going to one place, Help-FOO:</p>

  <table class="menu" border="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top">&bull; <a href=
      "Help_002dFOO.html#Help_002dFOO" accesskey="1">Foo</a>:</td>

      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top">A node you can visit for
      fun.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top">&bull; <a href=
      "Help_002dFOO.html#Help_002dFOO" accesskey="2">Bar</a>:</td>

      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top">We have made two ways to get to
      the same place.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td align="left" valign="top">&bull; <a href=
      "Help_002dFOO.html#Help_002dFOO" accesskey=
      "3">Help-FOO</a>:</td>

      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <td align="left" valign="top">And yet another!</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>(Turn Visible mode on if you are using Emacs.)</p>

  <div class="format">
    <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt;  Now type just an <kbd>m</kbd> and see what happens:
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Now you are &ldquo;inside&rdquo; an <kbd>m</kbd> command.
  Commands cannot be used now; the next thing you will type must be
  the name of a subtopic.</p>

  <p>You can change your mind about doing the <kbd>m</kbd> by
  typing <kbd>Control-g</kbd>.</p>

  <div class="format">
    <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Try that now;  notice the bottom line clear.
</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="format">
    <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Then type another <kbd>m</kbd>.
</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="format">
    <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Now type <kbd>BAR</kbd>, the item name.  Do not type <tt class="key">RET</tt> yet.
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>While you are typing the item name, you can use the <tt class=
  "key">DEL</tt> (or <tt class="key">BACKSPACE</tt>) key to cancel
  one character at a time if you make a mistake.</p>

  <div class="format">
    <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Press <tt class=
"key">DEL</tt> to cancel the &lsquo;<samp>R</samp>&rsquo;.  You could type another <kbd>R</kbd>
   to replace it.  But you do not have to, since &lsquo;<samp>BA</samp>&rsquo; is a valid
   abbreviation.
</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="format">
    <pre class="format">
&gt;&gt; Now you are ready to go.  Type a <tt class="key">RET</tt>.
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>After visiting &lsquo;<samp>Help-FOO</samp>&rsquo;, you should
  return here.</p>

  <p>Another way to move to the menu subtopic lines and between
  them is to type <tt class="key">TAB</tt>. Each time you type a
  <tt class="key">TAB</tt>, you move to the next subtopic line. To
  move to a previous subtopic line in the stand-alone reader, type
  <kbd>M-<span class="key">TAB</span></kbd>&mdash;that is, press
  and hold the <tt class="key">META</tt> key and then press
  <tt class="key">TAB</tt>. (On some keyboards, the <tt class=
  "key">META</tt> key might be labeled
  &lsquo;<samp>Alt</samp>&rsquo;.) In Emacs Info, type
  <kbd>S-<span class="key">TAB</span></kbd> to move to a previous
  subtopic line (press and hold the <tt class="key">Shift</tt> key
  and then press <tt class="key">TAB</tt>).</p>

  <p>Once you move cursor to a subtopic line, press <tt class=
  "key">RET</tt> to go to that subtopic&rsquo;s node.</p><a name=
  "index-mouse-support-in-Info-mode" id=
  "index-mouse-support-in-Info-mode"></a> <a name=
  "index-mouse_002d2-_0028Info-mode_0029" id=
  "index-mouse_002d2-_0028Info-mode_0029"></a>

  <p>If your terminal supports a mouse, you have yet another way of
  going to a subtopic. Move your mouse pointer to the subtopic
  line, somewhere between the beginning
  &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; and the colon
  &lsquo;<samp>:</samp>&rsquo; which ends the subtopic&rsquo;s
  brief name. You will see the subtopic&rsquo;s name change its
  appearance (usually, its background color will change), and the
  shape of the mouse pointer will change if your platform supports
  that. After a while, if you leave the mouse on that spot, a small
  window will pop up, saying &ldquo;mouse-2: go to that
  node,&rdquo; or the same message may appear at the bottom of the
  screen.</p>

  <p><kbd>mouse-2</kbd> is the second button of your mouse counting
  from the left&mdash;the middle button on a 3-button mouse. (On a
  2-button mouse, you may have to press both buttons together to
  &ldquo;press the middle button&rdquo;.) The message tells you
  pressing <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> with the current position of the
  mouse pointer (on subtopic in the menu) will go to that
  subtopic.</p><a name=
  "index-Info_002dmouse_002dfollow_002dnearest_002dnode" id=
  "index-Info_002dmouse_002dfollow_002dnearest_002dnode"></a>

  <p>More generally, <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> in an Info buffer finds the
  nearest link to another node and goes there. For example, near a
  cross reference it acts like <kbd>f</kbd>, in a menu it acts like
  <kbd>m</kbd>, on the node&rsquo;s header line it acts like
  <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>p</kbd>, or <kbd>u</kbd>, etc. At end of the
  node&rsquo;s text <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> moves to the next node, or
  up if there&rsquo;s no next node.</p>
