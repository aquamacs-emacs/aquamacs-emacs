<h2 class="unnumbered">Autotyping</h2>

<p>Under certain circumstances you will find yourself typing similar things
over and over again.  This is especially true of form letters and programming
language constructs.  Project-specific header comments, flow-control
constructs or magic numbers are essentially the same every time.  Emacs has
various features for doing tedious and repetitive typing chores for you
in addition to the Abbrev features (see <a href="emacs.html#Abbrevs">Abbrevs</a>).

   <p>One solution is using skeletons, flexible rules that say what to
insert, and how to do it.  Various programming language modes offer some
ready-to-use skeletons, and you can adapt them to suit your needs or
taste, or define new ones.

   <p>Another feature is automatic insertion of what you want into empty files,
depending on the file-name or the mode as appropriate.  You can have a file or
a skeleton inserted, or you can call a function.  Then there is the
possibility to have Un*x interpreter scripts automatically take on a magic
number and be executable as soon as they are saved.  Or you can have a
copyright notice's year updated, if necessary, every time you save a
file.  Similarly for time stamps in the file.

   <p>URLs can be inserted based on a word at point.  Flexible templates can
be defined for inserting and navigating between text more generally.  A
sort of meta-expansion facility can be used to try a set of alternative
completions and expansions of text at point.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Using Skeletons</h2>

<p><a name="index-skeletons-1"></a><a name="index-using-skeletons-2"></a>
  When you want Emacs to insert a form letter or a typical construct of the
programming language you are using, skeletons are a means of accomplishing
this.  Normally skeletons each have a command of their own, that, when called,
will insert the skeleton.  These commands can be issued in the usual ways
(see <a href="emacs.html#Commands">Commands</a>).  Modes that offer various skeletons will often
bind these to key-sequences on the <kbd>C-c</kbd> prefix, as well as having
an <cite>Insert</cite> menu and maybe even predefined abbrevs for them
(see <a href="#Skeletons-as-Abbrevs">Skeletons as Abbrevs</a>).

   <p>The simplest kind of skeleton will simply insert some text indented
according to the major mode and leave the cursor at a likely place in the
middle.  Interactive skeletons may prompt you for a string that will be part
of the inserted text.

   <p>Skeletons may ask for input several times.  They even have a looping
mechanism in which you will be asked for input as long as you are willing to
furnish it.  An example would be multiple &ldquo;else if&rdquo; conditions.  You can
recognize this situation by a prompt ending in &lt;RET&gt;, <kbd>C-g</kbd>
or <kbd>C-h</kbd>.  This
means that entering an empty string will simply assume that you are finished. 
Typing quit on the other hand terminates the loop but also the rest of the
skeleton, e.g., an &ldquo;else&rdquo; clause is skipped.  Only a syntactically necessary
termination still gets inserted.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Wrapping Skeletons Around Existing Text</h2>

<p><a name="index-wrapping-skeletons-3"></a>
  Often you will find yourself with some code that for whatever reason
suddenly becomes conditional.  Or you have written a bit of text and want to
put it in the middle of a form letter.  Skeletons provide a means for
accomplishing this, and can even, in the case of programming languages,
reindent the wrapped code for you.

   <p>Skeleton commands take an optional numeric prefix argument
(see <a href="emacs.html#Arguments">Arguments</a>).  This is interpreted in two different ways depending
on whether the prefix is positive, i.e., forwards oriented, or negative,
i.e., backwards oriented.

   <p>A positive prefix means to wrap the skeleton around that many
following words.  This is accomplished by putting the words there where
the point is normally left after that skeleton is inserted (see <a href="#Using-Skeletons">Using Skeletons</a>).  The point (see <a href="emacs.html#Point">Point</a>) is left at the next
interesting spot in the skeleton instead.

   <p>A negative prefix means to do something similar with that many previously
marked interregions (see <a href="emacs.html#Mark">Mark</a>).  In the simplest case, if you type
<kbd>M--</kbd> just before issuing the skeleton command, that will wrap the
skeleton around the current region, just like a positive argument would have
wrapped it around a number of words.

   <p>Smaller negative arguments will wrap that many interregions into successive
interesting spots within the skeleton, again leaving the point at the next one. 
We speak about interregions rather than regions here, because we treat them in
the order they appear in the buffer, which coincides with successive regions
only if they were marked in order.

   <p>That is, if you marked in alphabetical order the points A B C [] (where []
represents the point) and call a skeleton command with <kbd>M-- 3</kbd>, you will
wrap the text from A to B into the first interesting spot of the skeleton, the
text from B to C into the next one, the text from C to the point into the
third one, and leave the point in the fourth one.  If there are less marks in
the buffer, or if the skeleton defines less interesting points, the surplus is
ignored.

   <p>If, on the other hand, you marked in alphabetical order the points [] A C B,
and call a skeleton command with <kbd>M-- 3</kbd>, you will wrap the text from
point to A, then the text from A to C and finally the text from C to B.  This
is done because the regions overlap and Emacs would be helplessly lost if it
tried to follow the order in which you marked these points.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Skeletons as Abbrev Expansions</h2>

<p><a name="index-skeletons-as-abbrevs-4"></a>
  Rather than use a key binding for every skeleton command, you can also
define an abbreviation (see <a href="emacs.html#Defining-Abbrevs">Defining Abbrevs</a>) that will expand
(see <a href="emacs.html#Expanding-Abbrevs">Expanding Abbrevs</a>) into the skeleton.

   <p>Say you want &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ifst</span></samp>&rsquo; to be an abbreviation for the C language if
statement.  You will tell Emacs that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ifst</span></samp>&rsquo; expands to the empty string
and then calls the skeleton command.  In Emacs Lisp you can say something like
<code>(define-abbrev c-mode-abbrev-table "ifst" "" 'c-if)</code>.  Or you can edit
the output from <kbd>M-x list-abbrevs</kbd> to make it look like this:

<pre class="example">     (c-mode-abbrev-table)
     "ifst"           0    ""         c-if
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Some blank lines of no semantic significance, and other abbrev tables,
have been omitted.)

<h2 class="chapter">4 Skeleton Language</h2>

<p><a name="index-skeleton-language-5"></a>
<a name="index-skeleton_002dinsert-6"></a>  Skeletons are an shorthand extension to the Lisp language, where various
atoms directly perform either actions on the current buffer or rudimentary
flow control mechanisms.  Skeletons are interpreted by the function
<code>skeleton-insert</code>.

   <p>A skeleton is a list starting with an interactor, which is usually a
prompt-string, or <code>nil</code> when not needed, but can also be a Lisp
expression for complex read functions or for returning some calculated value. 
The rest of the list are any number of elements as described in the following
table:

     <dl>
<dt><code>"</code><var>string</var><code>"</code>, <code>?</code><var>c</var>, <code>?\</code><var>c</var><dd><a name="index-skeleton_002dtransformation-7"></a>Insert string or character.  Literal strings and characters are passed through
<code>skeleton-transformation</code> when that is non-<code>nil</code>. 
<br><dt><code>?\n</code><dd><!-- ??? something seems very wrong here. -->
Insert a newline and align under current line, but not if this is the
last element of a skeleton and the newline would be inserted at end of
line, or this is the first element and the newline would be inserted
at beginning of line.  Use newline character <code>?\n</code> to prevent
alignment.  Use <code>"\n"</code> as the first or last string element of a
skeleton to insert a newline unconditionally. 
<br><dt><code>_</code><dd>Interesting point.  When wrapping skeletons around successive regions, they are
put at these places.  Point is left at first <code>_</code> where nothing is wrapped. 
<br><dt><code>&gt;</code><dd>Indent line according to major mode.  When following element is <code>_</code>, and
there is a interregion that will be wrapped here, indent that interregion. 
<br><dt><code>&amp;</code><dd>Logical and.  If preceding element moved point, i.e., usually inserted
something, do following element. 
<br><dt><code>|</code><dd>Logical xor.  If preceding element didn't move point, i.e., usually inserted
nothing, do following element. 
<br><dt><code>-</code><var>number</var><dd>Delete preceding number characters.  Depends on value of
<code>skeleton-untabify</code>. 
<br><dt><code>()</code> or <code>nil</code><dd>Ignored. 
<br><dt><var>lisp-expression</var><dd>Evaluated, and the return value is again interpreted as a skeleton element. 
<br><dt><code>str</code><dd>A special variable that, when evaluated the first time, usually prompts
for input according to the skeleton's interactor.  It is then set to the
return value resulting from the interactor.  Each subskeleton has its local
copy of this variable. 
<br><dt><code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code><dd>Skeleton-local user variables. 
<br><dt><code>'</code><var>expression</var><dd>Evaluate following Lisp expression for its side-effect, but prevent it from
being interpreted as a skeleton element. 
<br><dt><var>skeleton</var><dd>Subskeletons are inserted recursively, not once, but as often as the user
enters something at the subskeletons interactor.  Thus there must be a
<code>str</code> in the subskeleton.  They can also be used non-interactively, when
prompt is a lisp-expression that returns successive list-elements. 
<br><dt><code>resume:</code><dd>Ignored.  Execution resumes here if the user quits during skeleton
interpretation. 
<br><dt><code>quit</code><dd>A constant which is non-<code>nil</code> when the <code>resume:</code> section was entered
because the user quit. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-skeleton_002dfurther_002delements-8"></a>  Some modes also use other skeleton elements they themselves defined.  For
example in shell script mode's skeletons you will find <code>&lt;</code> which does a
rigid indentation backwards, or in CC mode's skeletons you find the
self-inserting elements <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>.  These are defined by the
buffer-local variable <code>skeleton-further-elements</code> which is a list of
variables bound while interpreting a skeleton.

   <p><a name="index-define_002dskeleton-9"></a>  The macro <code>define-skeleton</code> defines a command for interpreting a
skeleton.  The first argument is the command name, the second is a
documentation string, and the rest is an interactor and any number of skeleton
elements together forming a skeleton.  This skeleton is assigned to a variable
of the same name as the command and can thus be overridden from your
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file (see <a href="emacs.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).

<h2 class="chapter">5 Inserting Matching Pairs of Characters</h2>

<p><a name="index-inserting-pairs-10"></a><a name="index-pairs-11"></a>
  Various characters usually appear in pairs.  When, for example, you insert
an open parenthesis, no matter whether you are programming or writing prose,
you will surely enter a closing one later.  By entering both at the same time
and leaving the cursor in between, Emacs can guarantee you that such
parentheses are always balanced.  And if you have a non-qwerty keyboard, where
typing some of the stranger programming language symbols makes you bend your
fingers backwards, this can be quite relieving too.

   <p><a name="index-skeleton_002dpair_002dinsert_002dmaybe-12"></a><a name="index-skeleton_002dpair-13"></a>  This is done by binding the first key (see <a href="emacs.html#Rebinding">Rebinding</a>) of
the pair to <code>skeleton-pair-insert-maybe</code> instead of
<code>self-insert-command</code>.  The &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; comes from the fact that
this at-first surprising behavior is initially turned off.  To enable
it, you must set <code>skeleton-pair</code> to some non-<code>nil</code> value. 
And even then, a positive argument (see <a href="emacs.html#Arguments">Arguments</a>) will
make this key behave like a self-inserting key
(see <a href="emacs.html#Inserting-Text">Inserting Text</a>).

   <p><a name="index-skeleton_002dpair_002don_002dword-14"></a>  While this breaks with the stated intention of always balancing pairs, it
turns out that one often doesn't want pairing to occur, when the following
character is part of a word.  If you want pairing to occur even then, set
<code>skeleton-pair-on-word</code> to some non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p><a name="index-skeleton_002dpair_002dalist-15"></a>  Pairing is possible for all visible characters.  By default the
parenthesis &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo;, the square bracket &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo;, the brace
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>&rsquo; and the pointed bracket &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; all
pair with the symmetrical character, and the grave accent &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">`</span></samp>&rsquo;
pairs with the apostrophe &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo;.  All other characters pair
themselves.  This behavior can be modified by the variable
<code>skeleton-pair-alist</code>.  This is in fact an alist of skeletons
(see <a href="#Skeleton-Language">Skeleton Language</a>), with the first part of each sublist
matching the typed character.  This is the position of the interactor,
but since pairs don't need the <code>str</code> element, this is ignored.

   <p>Some modes have bound the command <code>skeleton-pair-insert-maybe</code>
to relevant keys.  These modes also configure the pairs as
appropriate.  For example, when typing TeX input, you'd expect the
grave accent (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">`</span></samp>&rsquo;) to pair with the apostrophe (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo;), while in Shell
script mode it must pair to itself.  They can also inhibit pairing in
certain contexts.  For example an escaped character stands for itself.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Autoinserting Text in Empty Files</h2>

<p><a name="index-autoinserting-16"></a>
<a name="index-auto_002dinsert-17"></a>  <kbd>M-x auto-insert</kbd> will put some predefined text at the beginning of
the buffer.  The main application for this function, as its name suggests,
is to have it be called automatically every time an empty, and only an
empty file is visited.  This is accomplished by putting <code>(add-hook
'find-file-hook 'auto-insert)</code> into your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file
(see <a href="emacs.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dinsert_002dalist-18"></a>  What gets inserted, if anything, is determined by the variable
<code>auto-insert-alist</code>.  The <span class="sc">car</span>s of this list are each either
a mode name, making an element applicable when a buffer is in that
mode.  Or they can be a string, which is a regexp matched against the
buffer's file name.  In that way different kinds of files that have
the same mode in Emacs can be distinguished.  The <span class="sc">car</span>s may also
be cons cells consisting of mode name or regexp as above and an
additional descriptive string.

   <p>When a matching element is found, the <span class="sc">cdr</span> says what to do.  It may
be a string, which is a file name, whose contents are to be inserted, if
that file is found in the directory <code>auto-insert-directory</code> or under a
absolute file name.  Or it can be a skeleton (see <a href="#Skeleton-Language">Skeleton Language</a>) to
be inserted.

   <p>It can also be a function, which allows doing various things.  The function
can simply insert some text, indeed, it can be skeleton command (see <a href="#Using-Skeletons">Using Skeletons</a>).  It can be a lambda function which will for example conditionally
call another function.  Or it can even reset the mode for the buffer. If you
want to perform several such actions in order, you use a vector, i.e., several
of the above elements between square brackets (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p>By default C and C++ headers insert a definition of a symbol derived from
the filename to prevent multiple inclusions.  C and C++ sources insert an
include of the header.  Makefiles insert the file makefile.inc if it exists.

   <p>TeX and bibTeX mode files insert the file tex-insert.tex if it exists, while
LaTeX mode files insert a typical <code>\documentclass</code> frame.  Html
files insert a skeleton with the usual frame.

   <p>Ada mode files call the Ada header skeleton command.  Emacs lisp
source files insert the usual header, with a copyright of your
environment variable <samp><span class="env">$ORGANIZATION</span></samp> or else the FSF, and prompt
for valid keywords describing the contents.  Files in a <samp><span class="file">bin</span></samp>
directory for which Emacs could determine no specialized mode
(see <a href="emacs.html#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>) are set to Shell script mode.

   <p><a name="index-define_002dauto_002dinsert-19"></a>  In Lisp (see <a href="emacs.html#Init-File">Init File</a>) you can use the function
<code>define-auto-insert</code> to add to or modify
<code>auto-insert-alist</code>.  See its documentation with <kbd>C-h f
define-auto-insert</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dinsert-20"></a>  The variable <code>auto-insert</code> says what to do when <code>auto-insert</code> is
called non-interactively, e.g., when a newly found file is empty (see above):
     <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>Do nothing. 
<br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Insert something if possible, i.e., there is a matching entry in
<code>auto-insert-alist</code>. 
<br><dt>other<dd>Insert something if possible, but mark as unmodified. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dinsert_002dquery-21"></a>  The variable <code>auto-insert-query</code> controls whether to ask about
inserting something.  When this is <code>nil</code>, inserting is only done with
<kbd>M-x auto-insert</kbd>.  When this is <code>function</code>, you are queried
whenever <code>auto-insert</code> is called as a function, such as when Emacs
visits an empty file and you have set the above-mentioned hook.  Otherwise
you are always queried.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dinsert_002dprompt-22"></a>  When querying, the variable <code>auto-insert-prompt</code>'s value is used as a
prompt for a y-or-n-type question.  If this includes a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; construct,
that is replaced by what caused the insertion rule to be chosen.  This is
either a descriptive text, the mode-name of the buffer or the regular
expression that matched the filename.

notice at the point.  The &ldquo;by&rdquo; part is taken from your environment variable
<samp><span class="env">$ORGANIZATION</span></samp> or if that isn't set you are prompted for it.  If the
buffer has a comment syntax (see <a href="emacs.html#Comments">Comments</a>), this is inserted as a comment.

   <p><a name="index-copyright_002dupdate-25"></a><a name="index-copyright_002dlimit-26"></a><a name="index-copyright_002dcurrent_002dyear-27"></a>  <kbd>M-x copyright-update</kbd> looks for a copyright notice in the first
<code>copyright-limit</code> characters of the buffer and updates it when necessary. 
The current year (variable <code>copyright-current-year</code>) is added to the
existing ones, in the same format as the preceding year, i.e., 1994, '94 or 94. 
If a dash-separated year list up to last year is found, that is extended to
current year, else the year is added separated by a comma.  Or it replaces
them when this is called with a prefix argument.  If a header referring to a
wrong version of the GNU General Public License (see <a href="emacs.html#Copying">Copying</a>) is found,
that is updated too.

   <p>An interesting application for this function is to have it be called
automatically every time a file is saved.  This is accomplished by
putting <code>(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'copyright-update)</code> into
your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file (see <a href="emacs.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).  Alternative,
you can do <kbd>M-x customize-variable &lt;RET&gt; before-save-hook
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  <code>copyright-update</code> is conveniently listed as an
option in the customization buffer.

   <p><a name="index-copyright_002dquery-28"></a>  The variable <code>copyright-query</code> controls whether to update the
copyright or whether to ask about it.  When this is <code>nil</code> updating is
only done with <kbd>M-x copyright-update</kbd>.  When this is <code>function</code>
you are queried whenever <code>copyright-update</code> is called as a function,
such as in the <code>before-save-hook</code> feature mentioned above.  Otherwise
you are always queried.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Making Interpreter Scripts Executable</h2>

<p><a name="index-executables-29"></a>
<a name="index-executable_002dprefix-30"></a><a name="index-executable_002dchmod-31"></a>  Various interpreter modes such as Shell script mode or AWK mode will
automatically insert or update the buffer's magic number, a special
comment on the first line that makes the <code>exec</code> systemcall know
how to execute the script.  To this end the script is automatically
made executable upon saving, with <code>executable-chmod</code> as argument
to the system <code>chmod</code> command.  The magic number is prefixed by
the value of <code>executable-prefix</code>.

   <p><a name="index-executable_002dmagicless_002dfile_002dregexp-32"></a>  Any file whose name matches <code>executable-magicless-file-regexp</code> is not
furnished with a magic number, nor is it made executable.  This is mainly
intended for resource files, which are only meant to be read in.

   <p><a name="index-executable_002dinsert-33"></a>  The variable <code>executable-insert</code> says what to do when
<code>executable-set-magic</code> is called non-interactively, e.g., when file has no
or the wrong magic number:
     <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>Do nothing. 
<br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Insert or update magic number. 
<br><dt>other<dd>Insert or update magic number, but mark as unmodified. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-executable_002dset_002dmagic-34"></a><a name="index-executable_002dquery-35"></a>  The variable <code>executable-query</code> controls whether to ask about
inserting or updating the magic number.  When this is <code>nil</code> updating
is only done with <kbd>M-x executable-set-magic</kbd>.  When this is
<code>function</code> you are queried whenever <code>executable-set-magic</code> is
called as a function, such as when Emacs puts a buffer in Shell script
mode.  Otherwise you are always queried.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Maintaining Timestamps in Modified Files</h2>

<p><a name="index-timestamps-36"></a>
<a name="index-time_002dstamp-37"></a><a name="index-before_002dsave_002dhook-38"></a>The <code>time-stamp</code> command can be used to update automatically a
template in a file with a new time stamp every time you save the file. 
Customize the hook <code>before-save-hook</code> to add the function
<code>time-stamp</code> to arrange this.  It you use Custom to do this,
then <code>time-stamp</code> is conveniently listed as an option in the
customization buffer.

   <p><a name="index-time_002dstamp_002dactive-39"></a><a name="index-time_002dstamp_002dformat-40"></a><a name="index-time_002dstamp_002dstart-41"></a>The time stamp is updated only if the customizable variable
<code>time-stamp-active</code> is on, which it is by default; the command
<code>time-stamp-toggle-active</code> can be used to toggle it.  The format of
the time stamp is set by the customizable variable
<code>time-stamp-format</code>.

   <p><a name="index-time_002dstamp_002dline_002dlimit-42"></a><a name="index-time_002dstamp_002dend-43"></a><a name="index-time_002dstamp_002dcount-44"></a><a name="index-time_002dstamp_002dinserts_002dlines-45"></a>The variables <code>time-stamp-line-limit</code>, <code>time-stamp-start</code>,
<code>time-stamp-end</code>, <code>time-stamp-count</code>, and
<code>time-stamp-inserts-lines</code> control finding the template.  Do not
change these in your init file or you will be incompatible with other
people's files.  If you must change them, do so only in the local
variables section of the file itself.

   <p>Normally the template must appear in the first 8 lines of a file and
look like one of the following:

<pre class="example">     Time-stamp: &lt;&gt;
     Time-stamp: " "
</pre>
   <p>The time stamp is written between the brackets or quotes:

<pre class="example">     Time-stamp: &lt;1998-02-18 10:20:51 gildea&gt;

<h2 class="chapter">11 Tempo: Flexible Template Insertion</h2>

<p><a name="index-templates-51"></a>The Tempo package provides a simple way to define powerful templates, or
macros, if you wish.  It is mainly intended for, but not limited to,
programmers to be used for creating shortcuts for editing
certain kinds of documents.

   <p><a name="index-tempo_002dbackward_002dmark-52"></a><a name="index-tempo_002dforward_002dmark-53"></a>A template is defined as a list of items to be inserted in the current
buffer at point.  Some can be simple strings, while others can control
formatting or define special points of interest in the inserted text. 
<kbd>M-x tempo-backward-mark</kbd> and <kbd>M-x tempo-forward-mark</kbd> can be
used to jump between such points.

   <p>More flexible templates can be created by including Lisp symbols, which
will be evaluated as variables, or lists, which will be evaluated
as Lisp expressions.  Automatic completion of specified tags to expanded
templates can be provided.

   <p><a name="index-tempo_002ddefine_002dtemplate-54"></a>See the documentation for <code>tempo-define-template</code> for the different
items that can be used to define a tempo template with a command for
inserting it.

<h2 class="chapter">12 &ldquo;Hippie&rdquo; Expansion</h2>

<p><a name="index-hippie_002dexpand-55"></a><a name="index-M_002d_002f-56"></a><a name="index-hippie_002dexpand_002dtry_002dfunctions_002dlist-57"></a><kbd>M-x hippie-expand</kbd> is a single command providing a variety of
completions and expansions.  Called repeatedly, it tries all possible
completions in succession.

   <p>Which ones to try, and in which order, is determined by the contents of
the customizable option <code>hippie-expand-try-functions-list</code>.  Much
customization of the expansion behavior can be made by changing the
order of, removing, or inserting new functions in this list.  Given a
positive numeric argument, <kbd>M-x hippie-expand</kbd> jumps directly that
number of functions forward in this list.  Given some other argument (a
negative argument or just <kbd>C-u</kbd>) it undoes the tried completion.

   <p>See the commentary in <samp><span class="file">hippie-exp.el</span></samp> for more information on the
possibilities.

   <p>Typically you would bind <code>hippie-expand</code> to <kbd>M-/</kbd> with
<code>dabbrev-expand</code>, the standard binding of <kbd>M-/</kbd>, providing one
of the expansion possibilities.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License</h2>

<!-- This file is intended to be included within another document, -->
<!-- hence no sectioning command or @node. -->
<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
