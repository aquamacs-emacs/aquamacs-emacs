  <h3 class="section">3.4 Useful Techniques when Writing Tests</h3>

  <p>Testing simple functions that have no side effects and no
  dependencies on their environment is easy. Such tests often look
  like this:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(ert-deftest ert-test-mismatch ()
  (should (eql (ert--mismatch "" "") nil))
  (should (eql (ert--mismatch "" "a") 0))
  (should (eql (ert--mismatch "a" "a") nil))
  (should (eql (ert--mismatch "ab" "a") 1))
  (should (eql (ert--mismatch "Aa" "aA") 0))
  (should (eql (ert--mismatch '(a b c) '(a b d)) 2)))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This test calls the function <code>ert--mismatch</code>
  several times with various combinations of arguments and compares
  the return value to the expected return value. (Some programmers
  prefer <code>(should (eql EXPECTED ACTUAL))</code> over the
  <code>(should (eql ACTUAL EXPECTED))</code> shown here. ERT works
  either way.)</p>

  <p>Here&rsquo;s a more complicated test:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(ert-deftest ert-test-record-backtrace ()
  (let ((test (make-ert-test :body (lambda () (ert-fail "foo")))))
    (let ((result (ert-run-test test)))
      (should (ert-test-failed-p result))
      (with-temp-buffer
        (ert--print-backtrace (ert-test-failed-backtrace result))
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (end-of-line)
        (let ((first-line (buffer-substring-no-properties
                           (point-min) (point))))
          (should (equal first-line
                         "  signal(ert-test-failed (\"foo\"))")))))))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This test creates a test object using
  <code>make-ert-test</code> whose body will immediately signal
  failure. It then runs that test and asserts that it fails. Then,
  it creates a temporary buffer and invokes
  <code>ert--print-backtrace</code> to print the backtrace of the
  failed test to the current buffer. Finally, it extracts the first
  line from the buffer and asserts that it matches what we expect.
  It uses <code>buffer-substring-no-properties</code> and
  <code>equal</code> to ignore text properties; for a test that
  takes properties into account, <code>buffer-substring</code> and
  <code>ert-equal-including-properties</code> could be used
  instead.</p>

  <p>The reason why this test only checks the first line of the
  backtrace is that the remainder of the backtrace is dependent on
  ERT&rsquo;s internals as well as whether the code is running
  interpreted or compiled. By looking only at the first line, the
  test checks a useful property&mdash;that the backtrace correctly
  captures the call to <code>signal</code> that results from the
  call to <code>ert-fail</code>&mdash;without being brittle.</p>

  <p>This example also shows that writing tests is much easier if
  the code under test was structured with testing in mind.</p>

  <p>For example, if <code>ert-run-test</code> accepted only
  symbols that name tests rather than test objects, the test would
  need a name for the failing test, which would have to be a
  temporary symbol generated with <code>make-symbol</code>, to
  avoid side effects on Emacs&rsquo;s state. Choosing the right
  interface for <code>ert-run-tests</code> allows the test to be
  simpler.</p>

  <p>Similarly, if <code>ert--print-backtrace</code> printed the
  backtrace to a buffer with a fixed name rather than the current
  buffer, it would be much harder for the test to undo the side
  effect. Of course, some code somewhere needs to pick the buffer
  name. But that logic is independent of the logic that prints
  backtraces, and keeping them in separate functions allows us to
  test them independently.</p>

  <p>A lot of code that you will encounter in Emacs was not written
  with testing in mind. Sometimes, the easiest way to write tests
  for such code is to restructure the code slightly to provide
  better interfaces for testing. Usually, this makes the interfaces
  easier to use as well.</p>
