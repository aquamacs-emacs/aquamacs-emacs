   <p>ERT is a tool for automated testing in Emacs Lisp.  Its main features
are facilities for defining tests, running them and reporting the
results, and for debugging test failures interactively.

   <p>ERT is similar to tools for other environments such as JUnit, but has
unique features that take advantage of the dynamic and interactive
nature of Emacs.  Despite its name, it works well both for test-driven
development (see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development</a>) and for
traditional software development methods.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>ERT allows you to define <em>tests</em> in addition to functions,
macros, variables, and the other usual Lisp constructs.  Tests are
simply Lisp code: code that invokes other code and checks whether
it behaves as expected.

   <p>ERT keeps track of the tests that are defined and provides convenient
commands to run them to verify whether the definitions that are
currently loaded in Emacs pass the tests.

   <p>Some Lisp files have comments like the following (adapted from the
package <code>pp.el</code>):

<pre class="lisp">     ;; (pp-to-string '(quote quote))          ; expected: "'quote"
     ;; (pp-to-string '((quote a) (quote b)))  ; expected: "('a 'b)\n"
     ;; (pp-to-string '('a 'b))                ; same as above
</pre>
   <p>The code contained in these comments can be evaluated from time to
time to compare the output with the expected output.  ERT formalizes
this and introduces a common convention, which simplifies Emacs
development, since programmers no longer have to manually find and
evaluate such comments.

   <p>An ERT test definition equivalent to the above comments is this:

<pre class="lisp">     (ert-deftest pp-test-quote ()
       "Tests the rendering of `quote' symbols in `pp-to-string'."
       (should (equal (pp-to-string '(quote quote)) "'quote"))
       (should (equal (pp-to-string '((quote a) (quote b))) "('a 'b)\n"))
       (should (equal (pp-to-string '('a 'b)) "('a 'b)\n")))
</pre>
   <p>If you know <code>defun</code>, the syntax of <code>ert-deftest</code> should look
familiar: This example defines a test named <code>pp-test-quote</code> that
will pass if the three calls to <code>equal</code> all return non-<code>nil</code>.

   <p><code>should</code> is a macro with the same meaning as <code>cl-assert</code> but
better error reporting.  See <a href="#The-_003ccode_003eshould_003c_002fcode_003e-Macro">The <code>should</code> Macro</a>.

   <p>Each test should have a name that describes what functionality it tests. 
Test names can be chosen arbitrarily&mdash;they are in a
namespace separate from functions and variables&mdash;but should follow
the usual Emacs Lisp convention of having a prefix that indicates
which package they belong to.  Test names are displayed by ERT when
reporting failures and can be used when selecting which tests to run.

   <p>The empty parentheses <code>()</code> in the first line don't currently have
any meaning and are reserved for future extension.  They also make
the syntax of <code>ert-deftest</code> more similar to that of <code>defun</code>.

   <p>The docstring describes what feature this test tests.  When running
tests interactively, the first line of the docstring is displayed for
tests that fail, so it is good if the first line makes sense on its
own.

   <p>The body of a test can be arbitrary Lisp code.  It should have as few
side effects as possible; each test should be written to clean up
after itself, leaving Emacs in the same state as it was before the
test.  Tests should clean up even if they fail.  See <a href="#Tests-and-Their-Environment">Tests and Their Environment</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">2 How to Run Tests</h2>

<p>You can run tests either in the Emacs you are working in, or on the
command line in a separate Emacs process in batch mode (i.e., with no
user interface).  The former mode is convenient during interactive
development, the latter is useful to make sure that tests pass
independently of your customizations; and it allows you to invoke
tests from makefiles, and to write scripts that run tests in several
different Emacs versions.

</div>

<h3 class="section">2.1 Running Tests Interactively</h3>

<p>You can run the tests that are currently defined in your Emacs with
the command <kbd>M-x ert RET t RET</kbd>.  (For an
explanation of the <code>t</code> argument, see <a href="#Test-Selectors">Test Selectors</a>.) ERT will pop
up a new buffer, the ERT results buffer, showing the results of the
tests run.  It looks like this:

<pre class="example">     Selector: t
     Passed:  31
     Skipped: 0
     Failed:  2 (2 unexpected)
     Total:   33/33
     
     Started at:   2008-09-11 08:39:25-0700
     Finished.
     Finished at:  2008-09-11 08:39:27-0700
     
     FF...............................
     
     F addition-test
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (=
             (+ 1 2)
             4))
           :form
           (= 3 4)
           :value nil))
     
     F list-test
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (equal
             (list 'a 'b 'c)
             '(a b d)))
           :form
           (equal
            (a b c)
            (a b d))
           :value nil :explanation
           (list-elt 2
                     (different-atoms c d))))
</pre>
   <p>At the top, there is a summary of the results: we ran all tests defined
in the current Emacs (<code>Selector: t</code>), 31 of them passed, and 2
failed unexpectedly.  See <a href="#Expected-Failures">Expected Failures</a>, for an explanation of
the term <em>unexpected</em> in this context.

   <p>The line of dots and <code>F</code>s is a progress bar where each character
represents one test; it fills while the tests are running.  A dot
means that the test passed, an <code>F</code> means that it failed.  Below
the progress bar, ERT shows details about each test that had an
unexpected result.  In the example above, there are two failures, both
due to failed <code>should</code> forms.  See <a href="#Understanding-Explanations">Understanding Explanations</a>,
for more details.

   <p>In the ERT results buffer, <kbd>TAB</kbd> and <kbd>S-TAB</kbd> cycle between
buttons.  Each name of a function or macro in this buffer is a button;
moving point to it and typing <kbd>RET</kbd> jumps to its definition.

   <p>Pressing <kbd>r</kbd> re-runs the test near point on its own.  Pressing
<kbd>d</kbd> re-runs it with the debugger enabled.  <kbd>.</kbd> jumps to the
definition of the test near point (<kbd>RET</kbd> has the same effect if
point is on the name of the test).  On a failed test, <kbd>b</kbd> shows
the backtrace of the failure.

   <p><kbd>l</kbd> shows the list of <code>should</code> forms executed in the test. 
If any messages were generated (with the Lisp function <code>message</code>)
in a test or any of the code that it invoked, <kbd>m</kbd> will show them.

   <p>By default, long expressions in the failure details are abbreviated
using <code>print-length</code> and <code>print-level</code>.  Pressing <kbd>L</kbd>
while point is on a test failure will increase the limits to show more
of the expression.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Running Tests in Batch Mode</h3>

<p>ERT supports automated invocations from the command line or from
scripts or makefiles.  There are two functions for this purpose,
<code>ert-run-tests-batch</code> and <code>ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit</code>. 
They can be used like this:

<pre class="example">     emacs -batch -l ert -l my-tests.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
</pre>
   <p>This command will start up Emacs in batch mode, load ERT, load
<code>my-tests.el</code>, and run all tests defined in it.  It will exit
with a zero exit status if all tests passed, or nonzero if any tests
failed or if anything else went wrong.  It will also print progress
messages and error diagnostics to standard output.

   <p>If ERT is not part of your Emacs distribution, you may need to use
<code>-L /path/to/ert/</code> so that Emacs can find it.  You may need
additional <code>-L</code> flags to ensure that <code>my-tests.el</code> and all the
files that it requires are on your <code>load-path</code>.

</div>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Test Selectors</h3>

<p>Functions like <code>ert</code> accept a <em>test selector</em>, a Lisp
expression specifying a set of tests.  Test selector syntax is similar
to Common Lisp's type specifier syntax:

     <ul>
<li><code>nil</code> selects no tests. 
<li><code>t</code> selects all tests. 
<li><code>:new</code> selects all tests that have not been run yet. 
<li><code>:failed</code> and <code>:passed</code> select tests according to their most recent result. 
<li><code>:expected</code>, <code>:unexpected</code> select tests according to their most recent result. 
<li>A string is a regular expression that selects all tests with matching names. 
<li>A test (i.e., an object of <code>ert-test</code> data type) selects that test. 
<li>A symbol selects the test that the symbol names. 
<li><code>(member TESTS...)</code> selects the elements of TESTS, a list of
tests or symbols naming tests. 
<li><code>(eql TEST)</code> selects TEST, a test or a symbol naming a test. 
<li><code>(and SELECTORS...)</code> selects the tests that match all SELECTORS. 
<li><code>(or SELECTORS...)</code> selects the tests that match any SELECTOR. 
<li><code>(not SELECTOR)</code> selects all tests that do not match SELECTOR. 
<li><code>(tag TAG)</code> selects all tests that have TAG on their tags list. 
(Tags are optional labels you can apply to tests when you define them.) 
<li><code>(satisfies PREDICATE)</code> selects all tests that satisfy PREDICATE,
a function that takes a test as argument and returns non-<code>nil</code> if
it is selected. 
</ul>

   <p>Selectors that are frequently useful when selecting tests to run
include <code>t</code> to run all tests that are currently defined in Emacs,
<code>"^foo-"</code> to run all tests in package <code>foo</code> (this assumes
that package <code>foo</code> uses the prefix <code>foo-</code> for its test names),
result-based selectors such as <code>(or :new :unexpected)</code> to
run all tests that have either not run yet or that had an unexpected
result in the last run, and tag-based selectors such as <code>(not
(tag :causes-redisplay))</code> to run all tests that are not tagged
<code>:causes-redisplay</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">3 How to Write Tests</h2>

<p>ERT lets you define tests in the same way you define functions.  You
can type <code>ert-deftest</code> forms in a buffer and evaluate them there
with <code>eval-defun</code> or <code>compile-defun</code>, or you can save the
file and load it, optionally byte-compiling it first.

   <p>Just like <code>find-function</code> is only able to find where a function
was defined if the function was loaded from a file, ERT is only able
to find where a test was defined if the test was loaded from a file.

<h3 class="section">3.1 The <code>should</code> Macro</h3>

<p>Test bodies can include arbitrary code; but to be useful, they need to
check whether the code being tested (or <em>code under test</em>)
does what it is supposed to do.  The macro <code>should</code> is similar to
<code>cl-assert</code> from the cl package
(see <a href="cl.html#Assertions">Assertions</a>),
but analyzes its argument form and records information that ERT can
display to help debugging.

   <p>This test definition

<pre class="lisp">     (ert-deftest addition-test ()
       (should (= (+ 1 2) 4)))
</pre>
   <p>will produce this output when run via <kbd>M-x ert</kbd>:

<pre class="example">     F addition-test
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (=
             (+ 1 2)
             4))
           :form
           (= 3 4)
           :value nil))
</pre>
   <p>In this example, <code>should</code> recorded the fact that (= (+ 1 2) 4)
reduced to (= 3 4) before it reduced to <code>nil</code>.  When debugging why the
test failed, it helps to know that the function <code>+</code> returned 3
here.  ERT records the return value for any predicate called directly
within <code>should</code>.

   <p>In addition to <code>should</code>, ERT provides <code>should-not</code>, which
checks that the predicate returns <code>nil</code>, and <code>should-error</code>, which
checks that the form called within it signals an error.  An example
use of <code>should-error</code>:

<pre class="lisp">     (ert-deftest test-divide-by-zero ()
       (should-error (/ 1 0)
                     :type 'arith-error))
</pre>
   <p>This checks that dividing one by zero signals an error of type
<code>arith-error</code>.  The <code>:type</code> argument to <code>should-error</code>
is optional; if absent, any type of error is accepted. 
<code>should-error</code> returns an error description of the error that was
signaled, to allow additional checks to be made.  The error
description has the format <code>(ERROR-SYMBOL . DATA)</code>.

   <p>There is no <code>should-not-error</code> macro since tests that signal an
error fail anyway, so <code>should-not-error</code> is effectively the
default.

   <p>See <a href="#Understanding-Explanations">Understanding Explanations</a>, for more details on what
<code>should</code> reports.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Expected Failures</h3>

<p>Some bugs are complicated to fix, or not very important, and are left as
<em>known bugs</em>.  If there is a test case that triggers the bug and
fails, ERT will alert you of this failure every time you run all
tests.  For known bugs, this alert is a distraction.  The way to
suppress it is to add <code>:expected-result :failed</code> to the test
definition:

<pre class="lisp">     (ert-deftest future-bug ()
       "Test `time-forward' with negative arguments.
     Since this functionality isn't implemented, the test is known to fail."
       :expected-result :failed
       (time-forward -1))
</pre>
   <p>ERT will still display a small <code>f</code> in the progress bar as a
reminder that there is a known bug, and will count the test as failed,
but it will be quiet about it otherwise.

   <p>An alternative to marking the test as a known failure this way is to
delete the test.  This is a good idea if there is no intent to fix it,
i.e., if the behavior that was formerly considered a bug has become an
accepted feature.

   <p>In general, however, it can be useful to keep tests that are known to
fail.  If someone wants to fix the bug, they will have a very good
starting point: an automated test case that reproduces the bug.  This
makes it much easier to fix the bug, demonstrate that it is fixed, and
prevent future regressions.

   <p>ERT displays the same kind of alerts for tests that pass unexpectedly
as it displays for unexpected failures.  This way, if you make code
changes that happen to fix a bug that you weren't aware of, you will
know to remove the <code>:expected-result</code> clause of that test and
close the corresponding bug report, if any.

   <p>Since <code>:expected-result</code> evaluates its argument when the test is
loaded, tests can be marked as known failures only on certain Emacs
versions, specific architectures, etc.:

<pre class="lisp">     (ert-deftest foo ()
       "A test that is expected to fail on Emacs 23 but succeed elsewhere."
       :expected-result (if (string-match "GNU Emacs 23[.]" (emacs-version))
                            :failed
                          :passed)
       ...)

<h3 class="section">3.3 Tests and Their Environment</h3>

<p>Sometimes, it doesn't make sense to run a test due to missing
preconditions.  A required Emacs feature might not be compiled in, the
function to be tested could call an external binary which might not be
available on the test machine, you name it.  In this case, the macro
<code>skip-unless</code> could be used to skip the test:

<pre class="lisp">     (ert-deftest test-dbus ()
       "A test that checks D-BUS functionality."
       (skip-unless (featurep 'dbusbind))
       ...)
</pre>
   <p>The outcome of running a test should not depend on the current state
of the environment, and each test should leave its environment in the
same state it found it in.  In particular, a test should not depend on
any Emacs customization variables or hooks, and if it has to make any
changes to Emacs's state or state external to Emacs (such as the file
system), it should undo these changes before it returns, regardless of
whether it passed or failed.

   <p>Tests should not depend on the environment because any such
dependencies can make the test brittle or lead to failures that occur
only under certain circumstances and are hard to reproduce.  Of
course, the code under test may have settings that affect its
behavior.  In that case, it is best to make the test <code>let</code>-bind
all such setting variables to set up a specific configuration for the
duration of the test.  The test can also set up a number of different
configurations and run the code under test with each.

   <p>Tests that have side effects on their environment should restore it to
its original state because any side effects that persist after the
test can disrupt the workflow of the programmer running the tests.  If
the code under test has side effects on Emacs's current state, such as
on the current buffer or window configuration, the test should create
a temporary buffer for the code to manipulate (using
<code>with-temp-buffer</code>), or save and restore the window configuration
(using <code>save-window-excursion</code>), respectively.  For aspects of
the state that can not be preserved with such macros, cleanup should
be performed with <code>unwind-protect</code>, to ensure that the cleanup
occurs even if the test fails.

   <p>An exception to this are messages that the code under test prints with
<code>message</code> and similar logging; tests should not bother restoring
the <samp><span class="file">*Message*</span></samp> buffer to its original state.

   <p>The above guidelines imply that tests should avoid calling highly
customizable commands such as <code>find-file</code>, except, of course, if
such commands are what they want to test.  The exact behavior of
<code>find-file</code> depends on many settings such as
<code>find-file-wildcards</code>, <code>enable-local-variables</code>, and
<code>auto-mode-alist</code>.  It is difficult to write a meaningful test if
its behavior can be affected by so many external factors.  Also,
<code>find-file</code> has side effects that are hard to predict and thus
hard to undo: It may create a new buffer or reuse an existing
buffer if one is already visiting the requested file; and it runs
<code>find-file-hook</code>, which can have arbitrary side effects.

   <p>Instead, it is better to use lower-level mechanisms with simple and
predictable semantics like <code>with-temp-buffer</code>, <code>insert</code> or
<code>insert-file-contents-literally</code>, and to activate any desired mode
by calling the corresponding function directly, after binding the
hook variables to <code>nil</code>.  This avoids the above problems.

<h3 class="section">3.4 Useful Techniques when Writing Tests</h3>

<p>Testing simple functions that have no side effects and no dependencies
on their environment is easy.  Such tests often look like this:

<pre class="lisp">     (ert-deftest ert-test-mismatch ()
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch "" "") nil))
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch "" "a") 0))
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch "a" "a") nil))
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch "ab" "a") 1))
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch "Aa" "aA") 0))
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch '(a b c) '(a b d)) 2)))
</pre>
   <p>This test calls the function <code>ert--mismatch</code> several times with
various combinations of arguments and compares the return value to the
expected return value.  (Some programmers prefer <code>(should (eql
EXPECTED ACTUAL))</code> over the <code>(should (eql ACTUAL EXPECTED))</code>
shown here.  ERT works either way.)

   <p>Here's a more complicated test:

<pre class="lisp">     (ert-deftest ert-test-record-backtrace ()
       (let ((test (make-ert-test :body (lambda () (ert-fail "foo")))))
         (let ((result (ert-run-test test)))
           (should (ert-test-failed-p result))
           (with-temp-buffer
             (ert--print-backtrace (ert-test-failed-backtrace result))
             (goto-char (point-min))
             (end-of-line)
             (let ((first-line (buffer-substring-no-properties
                                (point-min) (point))))
               (should (equal first-line
                              "  signal(ert-test-failed (\"foo\"))")))))))
</pre>
   <p>This test creates a test object using <code>make-ert-test</code> whose body
will immediately signal failure.  It then runs that test and asserts
that it fails.  Then, it creates a temporary buffer and invokes
<code>ert--print-backtrace</code> to print the backtrace of the failed test
to the current buffer.  Finally, it extracts the first line from the
buffer and asserts that it matches what we expect.  It uses
<code>buffer-substring-no-properties</code> and <code>equal</code> to ignore text
properties; for a test that takes properties into account,
<code>buffer-substring</code> and <code>ert-equal-including-properties</code>
could be used instead.

   <p>The reason why this test only checks the first line of the backtrace
is that the remainder of the backtrace is dependent on ERT's internals
as well as whether the code is running interpreted or compiled.  By
looking only at the first line, the test checks a useful property&mdash;that
the backtrace correctly captures the call to <code>signal</code> that
results from the call to <code>ert-fail</code>&mdash;without being brittle.

   <p>This example also shows that writing tests is much easier if the code
under test was structured with testing in mind.

   <p>For example, if <code>ert-run-test</code> accepted only symbols that name
tests rather than test objects, the test would need a name for the
failing test, which would have to be a temporary symbol generated with
<code>make-symbol</code>, to avoid side effects on Emacs's state.  Choosing
the right interface for <code>ert-run-tests</code> allows the test to be
simpler.

   <p>Similarly, if <code>ert--print-backtrace</code> printed the backtrace to a
buffer with a fixed name rather than the current buffer, it would be
much harder for the test to undo the side effect.  Of course, some
code somewhere needs to pick the buffer name.  But that logic is
independent of the logic that prints backtraces, and keeping them in
separate functions allows us to test them independently.

   <p>A lot of code that you will encounter in Emacs was not written with
testing in mind.  Sometimes, the easiest way to write tests for such
code is to restructure the code slightly to provide better interfaces
for testing.  Usually, this makes the interfaces easier to use as
well.

</div>

<h3 class="section">4.1 Understanding Explanations</h3>

<p>Failed <code>should</code> forms are reported like this:

<pre class="example">     F addition-test
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (=
             (+ 1 2)
             4))
           :form
           (= 3 4)
           :value nil))
</pre>
   <p>ERT shows what the <code>should</code> expression looked like and what
values its subexpressions had: The source code of the assertion was
<code>(should (= (+ 1 2) 4))</code>, which applied the function <code>=</code> to
the arguments <code>3</code> and <code>4</code>, resulting in the value
<code>nil</code>.  In this case, the test is wrong; it should expect 3
rather than 4.

   <p>If a predicate like <code>equal</code> is used with <code>should</code>, ERT
provides a so-called <em>explanation</em>:

<pre class="example">     F list-test
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (equal
             (list 'a 'b 'c)
             '(a b d)))
           :form
           (equal
            (a b c)
            (a b d))
           :value nil :explanation
           (list-elt 2
                     (different-atoms c d))))
</pre>
   <p>In this case, the function <code>equal</code> was applied to the arguments
<code>(a b c)</code> and <code>(a b d)</code>.  ERT's explanation shows that
the item at index 2 differs between the two lists; in one list, it is
the atom c, in the other, it is the atom d.

   <p>In simple examples like the above, the explanation is unnecessary. 
But in cases where the difference is not immediately apparent, it can
save time:

<pre class="example">     F test1
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (equal x y))
           :form
           (equal a a)
           :value nil :explanation
           (different-symbols-with-the-same-name a a)))
</pre>
   <p>ERT only provides explanations for predicates that have an explanation
function registered.  See <a href="#Defining-Explanation-Functions">Defining Explanation Functions</a>.

<h3 class="section">4.2 Interactive Debugging</h3>

<p>Debugging failed tests essentially works the same way as debugging any
other problems with Lisp code.  Here are a few tricks specific to
tests:

     <ul>
<li>Re-run the failed test a few times to see if it fails in the same way
each time.  It's good to find out whether the behavior is
deterministic before spending any time looking for a cause.  In the
ERT results buffer, <kbd>r</kbd> re-runs the selected test.

     <li>Use <kbd>.</kbd> to jump to the source code of the test to find out exactly
what it does.  Perhaps the test is broken rather than the code
under test.

     <li>If the test contains a series of <code>should</code> forms and you can't
tell which one failed, use <kbd>l</kbd>, which shows you the list of all
<code>should</code> forms executed during the test before it failed.

     <li>Use <kbd>b</kbd> to view the backtrace.  You can also use <kbd>d</kbd> to re-run
the test with debugging enabled, this will enter the debugger and show
the backtrace as well; but the top few frames shown there will not be
relevant to you since they are ERT's own debugger hook.  <kbd>b</kbd>
strips them out, so it is more convenient.

     <li>If the test or the code under testing prints messages using
<code>message</code>, use <kbd>m</kbd> to see what messages it printed before it
failed.  This can be useful to figure out how far it got.

     <li>You can instrument tests for debugging the same way you instrument
<code>defun</code>s for debugging: go to the source code of the test and
type <kbd>C-u C-M-x</kbd>.  Then, go back to the ERT buffer and
re-run the test with <kbd>r</kbd> or <kbd>d</kbd>.

     <li>If you have been editing and rearranging tests, it is possible that
ERT remembers an old test that you have since renamed or removed:
renamings or removals of definitions in the source code leave around a
stray definition under the old name in the running process (this is a
common problem in Lisp).  In such a situation, hit <kbd>D</kbd> to let ERT
forget about the obsolete test. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">5.1 Defining Explanation Functions</h3>

<p>The explanation function for a predicate is a function that takes the
same arguments as the predicate and returns an <em>explanation</em>. 
The explanation should explain why the predicate, when invoked with
the arguments given to the explanation function, returns the value
that it returns.  The explanation can be any object but should have a
comprehensible printed representation.  If the return value of the
predicate needs no explanation for a given list of arguments, the
explanation function should return <code>nil</code>.

   <p>To associate an explanation function with a predicate, add the
property <code>ert-explainer</code> to the symbol that names the predicate. 
The value of the property should be the symbol that names the
explanation function.

   <p>If you want to write code that works with ERT tests, you should take a

<h3 class="section">6.2 Fixtures and Test Suites</h3>

<p>In many ways, ERT is similar to frameworks for other languages like
SUnit or JUnit.  However, two features commonly found in such
frameworks are notably absent from ERT: fixtures and test suites.

   <p>Fixtures are mainly used (e.g., in SUnit or JUnit) to provide an
environment for a set of tests, and consist of set-up and tear-down
functions.

   <p>While fixtures are a useful syntactic simplification in other
languages, this does not apply to Lisp, where higher-order functions
and <code>unwind-protect</code> are available.  One way to implement and use a
fixture in ERT is

<pre class="lisp">     (defun my-fixture (body)
       (unwind-protect
           (progn [set up]
                  (funcall body))
         [tear down]))
     
     (ert-deftest my-test ()
       (my-fixture
        (lambda ()
          [test code])))
</pre>
   <p>(Another way would be a <code>with-my-fixture</code> macro.)  This solves
the set-up and tear-down part, and additionally allows any test
to use any combination of fixtures, so it is more flexible than what
other tools typically allow.

   <p>If the test needs access to the environment the fixture sets up, the
fixture can be modified to pass arguments to the body.

   <p>These are well-known Lisp techniques.  Special syntax for them could
be added but would provide only a minor simplification.

   <p>(If you are interested in such syntax, note that splitting set-up and
tear-down into separate functions, like *Unit tools usually do, makes
it impossible to establish dynamic <code>let</code> bindings as part of the
fixture.  So, blindly imitating the way fixtures are implemented in
other languages would be counter-productive in Lisp.)

   <p>The purpose of test suites is to group related tests together.

   <p>The most common use of this is to run just the tests for one
particular module.  Since symbol prefixes are the usual way of
separating module namespaces in Emacs Lisp, test selectors already
solve this by allowing regexp matching on test names; e.g., the
selector <code>"^ert-"</code> selects ERT's self-tests.

   <p>Other uses include grouping tests by their expected execution time,
e.g., to run quick tests during interactive development and slow tests less
often.  This can be achieved with the <code>:tag</code> argument to
<code>ert-deftest</code> and <code>tag</code> test selectors.

that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
