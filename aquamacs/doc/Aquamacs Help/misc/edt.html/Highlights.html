  <h2 class="chapter">6 Some Highlights, and Comparisons to the
  Original Emacs EDT Emulation</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>The EDT define key command is supported
    (<code>edt-define-key</code>) and is bound to <kbd>C-k</kbd> in
    the default EDT mode when EDT control sequence bindings are
    enabled, or when the sample <samp>edt-user.el</samp>
    customization file is used. The TPU/EVE learn command is
    supported but not bound to a key in the default EDT mode but is
    bound in the sample <samp>edt-user.el</samp> file.

      <p>Unlike the TPU/EVE learn command, which uses one key to
      begin the learn sequence, <kbd>C-l</kbd>, and another command
      to remember the sequence, <kbd>C-r</kbd>, this version of the
      learn command (<code>edt-learn</code>) serves as a toggle to
      both begin and to remember the learn sequence.</p>

      <p>Many users who change the meaning of a key with the define
      key and the learn commands, would like to be able to restore
      the original key binding without having to quit and restart
      emacs. So a restore key command is provided to do just that.
      When invoked, it prompts you to press the key to which you
      wish the last replaced key definition restored. It is bound
      to <kbd>GOLD C-k</kbd> in the default EDT mode when EDT
      control sequence bindings are enabled or the sample
      <samp>edt-user.el</samp> customization file is used.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Direction support is fully supported.</li>

    <li>All original Emacs bindings are fully restored when EDT
    emulation is turned off. So, if a fellow worker comes over to
    your terminal to help you with a software problem, for example,
    and is completely confused by your EDT emulation bindings, just
    enter the command, <code>edt-emulation-off</code>, at the
    &lsquo;<samp>M-x</samp>&rsquo; prompt and the original Emacs
    bindings will be restored. To resume the EDT emulation, just
    enter <code>edt-emulation-on</code>.</li>

    <li>User custom EDT bindings are kept separate from the default
    EDT bindings. One can toggle back and forth between the custom
    EDT bindings and default EDT bindings.</li>

    <li>The Emacs functions in <samp>edt.el</samp> attempt to
    emulate, where practical, the exact behavior of the
    corresponding EDT keypad mode commands. In a few cases, the
    emulation is not exact, but we hope you will agree it is close
    enough. In a very few cases, we chose to use the Emacs way of
    handling things. As mentioned earlier, we do not emulate the
    EDT &lsquo;<samp>SUBS</samp>&rsquo; command. Instead, we chose
    to use the Emacs <code>query-replace</code> function, which we
    find to be easier to use.</li>

    <li>Emacs uses the regexp assigned to
    <code>page-delimiter</code> to determine what marks a page
    break. This is normally &lsquo;<samp>^\f</samp>&rsquo;, which
    causes the <code>edt-page</code> command to ignore form feeds
    not located at the beginning of a line. To emulate the EDT
    &lsquo;<samp>PAGE</samp>&rsquo; command exactly, page-delimiter
    is set to &lsquo;<samp>\f</samp>&rsquo; when EDT emulation is
    turned on, and restored to &lsquo;<samp>^\f</samp>&rsquo; when
    EDT emulation is turned off. But, since some users prefer the
    Emacs definition of a page break, or may wish to preserve a
    customized definition of page break, one can override the EDT
    definition by placing

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
(setq edt-keep-current-page-delimiter t)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>in your <samp>.emacs</samp> file. Or, you can used the
      Emacs customize command to change its setting.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The EDT definition of a section of a terminal window is
    hardwired to be 16 lines of its one-and-only 24-line window
    (the EDT &lsquo;<samp>SECT</samp>&rsquo; command bound to
    <tt class="key">KP8</tt>). That&rsquo;s two-thirds of the
    window at a time. Since Emacs, like TPU/EVE, can handle
    multiple windows of sizes of other than 24 lines, the
    definition of section used here has been modified to two-thirds
    of the current window. (There is also an
    <code>edt-scroll-window</code> function which you may prefer
    over the &lsquo;<samp>SECT</samp>&rsquo; emulation.)</li>

    <li>Cursor movement and deletion involving word entities is
    identical to EDT. This, above all else, gives the die-hard EDT
    user a sense of being at home. Also, an emulation of
    EDT&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp>SET ENTITY WORD</samp>&rsquo; command
    is provided, for those users who like to customize movement by
    a word at a time to their own liking.</li>

    <li>EDT&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp>FIND</samp>&rsquo; and
    &lsquo;<samp>FNDNXT</samp>&rsquo; are supported.</li>

    <li>EDT&rsquo;s &lsquo;<samp>APPEND</samp>&rsquo;,
    &lsquo;<samp>REPLACE</samp>&rsquo;, and
    &lsquo;<samp>SUBS</samp>&rsquo; commands are supported.</li>

    <li>&lsquo;<samp>CHNGCASE</samp>&rsquo; is supported. It works
    on individual characters or selected text, if
    &lsquo;<samp>SELECT</samp>&rsquo; is active. In addition, two
    new commands are provided: <code>edt-lowercase</code> and
    <code>edt-uppercase</code>. They work on individual
    <strong>words</strong> or selected text, if
    &lsquo;<samp>SELECT</samp>&rsquo; is active.</li>

    <li>Form feed and tab insert commands are supported.</li>

    <li>A new command, <code>edt-duplicate-word</code>, is
    provided. If you experiment with it, you might find it to be
    surprisingly useful and may wonder how you ever got along
    without it! It is assigned to <kbd>C-j</kbd> in the sample
    <samp>edt-user.el</samp> customization file.</li>

    <li>TPU/EVE&rsquo;s Rectangular Cut and Paste functions
    (originally from the EVE-Plus package) are supported. But
    unlike the TPU/EVE versions, these here support both insert and
    overwrite modes. The seven rectangular functions are bound to
    <tt class="key">F7</tt>, <tt class="key">F8</tt>,
    <kbd>GOLD-F8</kbd>, <tt class="key">F9</tt>,
    <kbd>GOLD-F9</kbd>, <tt class="key">F10</tt>, and
    <kbd>GOLD-F10</kbd> in the default EDT mode.</li>

    <li>The original EDT emulation package set up many default
    regular and GOLD bindings. We tried to preserve most (but not
    all!) of these, so users of the original emulation package will
    feel more at home.

      <p>Nevertheless, there are still many GOLD key sequences
      which are not bound to any functions. These are prime
      candidates to use for your own customizations.</p>

      <p>Also, there are several commands in <samp>edt.el</samp>
      not bound to any key. So, you will find it worthwhile to look
      through <samp>edt.el</samp> for functions you may wish to add
      to your personal customized bindings.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The VT200/VT300 series terminals steal the function keys
    <tt class="key">F1</tt> to <tt class="key">F5</tt> for their
    own use. These do not generate signals which are sent to the
    host. So, <samp>edt.el</samp> does not assign any default
    bindings to <tt class="key">F1</tt> through <tt class=
    "key">F5</tt>.

      <p>In addition, our VT220 terminals generate an interrupt
      when the <tt class="key">F6</tt> key is pressed
      (&lsquo;<samp>^C</samp>&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;<samp>^Y</samp>&rsquo;, can&rsquo;t remember which)
      and not the character sequence documented in the manual. So,
      binding Emacs commands to <tt class="key">F6</tt> will not
      work if your terminal behaves the same way.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The VT220 terminal has no <tt class="key">ESC</tt>,
    <tt class="key">BS</tt>, nor <tt class="key">LF</tt> keys, as
    does a VT100. So the default EDT bindings adopt the standard
    DEC convention of having the <tt class="key">F11</tt>,
    <tt class="key">F12</tt>, and <tt class="key">F13</tt> keys, on
    a VT200 series (and above) terminal, assigned to the same EDT
    functions that are bound to <tt class="key">ESC</tt>,
    <tt class="key">BS</tt>, and <tt class="key">LF</tt> on a VT100
    terminal.</li>

    <li>Each user, through the use of a private
    <samp>edt-user.el</samp> file, can customize, very easily,
    personal EDT emulation bindings.</li>

    <li>The EDT &lsquo;<samp>SELECT</samp>&rsquo; and
    &lsquo;<samp>RESET</samp>&rsquo; functions are supported.
    However, unlike EDT, pressing &lsquo;<samp>RESET</samp>&rsquo;
    to cancel text selection does <strong>not</strong> reset the
    existing setting of the current direction.

      <p>We also provide a TPU/EVE like version of the single
      &lsquo;<samp>SELECT/RESET</samp>&rsquo; function, called
      <code>edt-toggle-select</code>, which makes the EDT
      &lsquo;<samp>SELECT</samp>&rsquo; function into a toggle
      on/off switch. That is, if selection is on, pressing
      &lsquo;<samp>SELECT</samp>&rsquo; again turns selection off
      (cancels selection). This function is used in the sample
      <samp>edt-user.el</samp> customization file.</p>
    </li>

    <li>EDT scroll margins are supported, but are disabled by
    default. (<a href="Scroll-margins.html#Scroll-margins">Scroll
    margins</a> for instructions on how to enable them.)</li>
