<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>nXML mode is an Emacs major-mode for editing XML documents.  It supports
editing well-formed XML documents, and provides schema-sensitive editing
using RELAX NG Compact Syntax.  To get started, visit a file containing an
XML document, and, if necessary, use <kbd>M-x nxml-mode</kbd> to switch to nXML
mode.  By default, <code>auto-mode-alist</code> and <code>magic-fallback-alist</code>
put buffers in nXML mode if they have recognizable XML content or file
extensions.  You may wish to customize the settings, for example to
recognize different file extensions.

   <p>Once in nXML mode, you can type <kbd>C-h m</kbd> for basic information on the
mode.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">etc/nxml</span></samp> directory in the Emacs distribution contains some data
files used by nXML mode, and includes two files (<samp><span class="file">test-valid.xml</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">test-invalid.xml</span></samp>) that provide examples of valid and invalid XML
documents.

   <p>To get validation and schema-sensitive editing, you need a RELAX NG Compact
Syntax (RNC) schema for your document (see <a href="#Locating-a-schema">Locating a schema</a>).  The
<samp><span class="file">etc/schema</span></samp> directory includes some schemas for popular document
types.  See <a href="http://relaxng.org/">http://relaxng.org/</a> for more information on RELAX NG. 
You can use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Trang</span></samp>&rsquo; program from
<a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html">http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html</a> to
automatically create RNC schemas.  This program can:

     <ul>
<li>infer an RNC schema from an instance document;
<li>convert a DTD to an RNC schema;
<li>convert a RELAX NG XML syntax schema to an RNC schema. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">To convert a RELAX NG XML syntax (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.rng</span></samp>&rsquo;) schema to a RNC
one, you can also use the XSLT stylesheet from
<a href="https://github.com/oleg-pavliv/emacs/tree/master/xsl">https://github.com/oleg-pavliv/emacs/tree/master/xsl</a>.

   <p>To convert a W3C XML Schema to an RNC schema, you need first to convert it
to RELAX NG XML syntax using the RELAX NG converter tool <code>rngconv</code>
(built on top of MSV).  See <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke/msv">https://github.com/kohsuke/msv</a>
and <a href="https://msv.dev.java.net/">https://msv.dev.java.net/</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Completion</h2>

<p>Apart from real-time validation, the most important feature that nXML
mode provides for assisting in document creation is "completion". 
Completion assists the user in inserting characters at point, based on
knowledge of the schema and on the contents of the buffer before
point.

   <p>nXML mode adapts the standard GNU Emacs command for completion in a
buffer: <code>completion-at-point</code>, which is bound to <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> and
<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.  Note that many window systems and window managers
use <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> themselves (typically for switching between
windows) and do not pass it to applications.  In that case, you should
type <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> for completion, or bind
<code>completion-at-point</code> to a key that is convenient for you.  In
the following, I will assume that you type <kbd>C-M-i</kbd>.

   <p>nXML mode completion works by examining the symbol preceding point. 
This is the symbol to be completed. The symbol to be completed may be
the empty. Completion considers what symbols starting with the symbol
to be completed would be valid replacements for the symbol to be
completed, given the schema and the contents of the buffer before
point.  These symbols are the possible completions.  An example may
make this clearer.  Suppose the buffer looks like this (where -!-
indicates point):

<pre class="example">     &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
     &lt;h-!-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and the schema is XHTML.  In this context, the symbol to be completed
is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The possible completions consist of just
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">head</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Another example, is

<pre class="example">     &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
     &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;-!-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this case, the symbol to be completed is empty, and the possible
completions are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">base</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">isindex</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">link</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">meta</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">script</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">style</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">title</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Another example is:

<pre class="example">     &lt;html xmlns="-!-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this case, the symbol to be completed is empty, and the possible
completions are just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>When you type <kbd>C-M-i</kbd>, what happens depends
on what the set of possible completions are.

     <ul>
<li>If the set of completions is empty, nothing
happens. 
<li>If there is one possible completion, then that completion is
inserted, together with any following characters that are
required. For example, in this case:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
          &lt;-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><kbd>C-M-i</kbd> will yield

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
          &lt;head-!-
</pre>
     <li>If there is more than one possible completion, but all
possible completions share a common non-empty prefix, then that prefix
is inserted. For example, suppose the buffer is:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html x-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The symbol to be completed is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. The possible completions are
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xmlns</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xml:lang</span></samp>&rsquo;.  These share a common prefix of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xml</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Thus, <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> will yield:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html xml-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Typically, you would do <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> again, which would have the result
described in the next item. 
<li>If there is more than one possible completion, but the
possible completions do not share a non-empty prefix, then Emacs will
prompt you to input the symbol in the minibuffer, initializing the
minibuffer with the symbol to be completed, and popping up a buffer
showing the possible completions.  You can now input the symbol to be
inserted.  The symbol you input will be inserted in the buffer instead
of the symbol to be completed.  Emacs will then insert any required
characters after the symbol.  For example, if it contains:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html xml-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Emacs will prompt you in the minibuffer with

     <pre class="example">          Attribute: xml-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and the buffer showing possible completions will contain

     <pre class="example">          Possible completions are:
          xml:lang                           xmlns
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If you input <kbd>xmlns</kbd>, the result will be:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html xmlns="-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">(If you do <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> again, the namespace URI will be
inserted. Should that happen automatically?)

<h2 class="chapter">3 Inserting end-tags</h2>

<p>The main redundancy in XML syntax is end-tags.  nXML mode provides
several ways to make it easier to enter end-tags.  You can use all of
these without a schema.

   <p>You can use <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;/</span></samp>&rsquo; to complete the rest of the
end-tag.

   <p><kbd>C-c C-f</kbd> inserts an end-tag for the element containing
point. This command is useful when you want to input the start-tag,
then input the content and finally input the end-tag. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo;
is mnemonic for finish.

   <p>If you want to keep tags balanced and input the end-tag at the
same time as the start-tag, before inputting the content, then you can
use <kbd>C-c C-i</kbd>. This inserts a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, then inserts
the end-tag and leaves point before the end-tag.  <kbd>C-c C-b</kbd>
is similar but more convenient for block-level elements: it puts the
start-tag, point and the end-tag on successive lines, appropriately
indented. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; is mnemonic for inline and the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; is mnemonic for block.

   <p>Finally, you can customize nXML mode so that <kbd>/</kbd> automatically
inserts the rest of the end-tag when it occurs after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, by
doing

<pre class="display">     <kbd>M-x customize-variable &lt;RET&gt; nxml-slash-auto-complete-flag &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and then following the instructions in the displayed buffer.

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">4 Paragraphs</h2>

<p>Emacs has several commands that operate on paragraphs, most
notably <kbd>M-q</kbd>. nXML mode redefines these to work in a way
that is useful for XML.  The exact rules that are used to find the
beginning and end of a paragraph are complicated; they are designed
mainly to ensure that <kbd>M-q</kbd> does the right thing.

   <p>A paragraph consists of one or more complete, consecutive lines. 
A group of lines is not considered a paragraph unless it contains some
non-whitespace characters between tags or inside comments.  A blank
line separates paragraphs.  A single tag on a line by itself also
separates paragraphs.  More precisely, if one tag together with any
leading and trailing whitespace completely occupy one or more lines,
then those lines will not be included in any paragraph.

   <p>A start-tag at the beginning of the line (possibly indented) may
be treated as starting a paragraph.  Similarly, an end-tag at the end
of the line may be treated as ending a paragraph. The following rules
are used to determine whether such a tag is in fact treated as a
paragraph boundary:

     <ul>
<li>If the schema does not allow text at that point, then it
is a paragraph boundary. 
<li>If the end-tag corresponding to the start-tag is not at
the end of its line, or the start-tag corresponding to the end-tag is
not at the beginning of its line, then it is not a paragraph
boundary. For example, in

     <pre class="example">          &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph with an
          &lt;emph&gt;emphasized&lt;/emph&gt; phrase.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;emph&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; start-tag would not be considered as
starting a paragraph, because its corresponding end-tag is not at the
end of the line. 
<li>If there is text that is a sibling in element tree, then
it is not a paragraph boundary.  For example, in

     <pre class="example">          &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph with an
          &lt;emph&gt;emphasized phrase that takes one source line&lt;/emph&gt;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;emph&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; start-tag would not be considered as
starting a paragraph, even though its end-tag is at the end of its
line, because there the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">This is a paragraph with an</span></samp>&rsquo;
is a sibling of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emph</span></samp>&rsquo; element. 
<li>Otherwise, it is a paragraph boundary. 
</ul>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Outlining</h2>

<p>nXML mode allows you to display all or part of a buffer as an
outline, in a similar way to Emacs's outline mode.  An outline in nXML
mode is based on recognizing two kinds of element: sections and
headings.  There is one heading for every section and one section for
every heading.  A section contains its heading as or within its first
child element.  A section also contains its subordinate sections (its
subsections).  The text content of a section consists of anything in a
section that is neither a subsection nor a heading.

   <p>Note that this is a different model from that used by XHTML. 
nXML mode's outline support will not be useful for XHTML unless you
adopt a convention of adding a <code>div</code> to enclose each
section, rather than having sections implicitly delimited by different
<code>h</code><var>n</var> elements.  This limitation may be removed
in a future version.

   <p>The variable <code>nxml-section-element-name-regexp</code> gives
a regexp for the local names (i.e., the part of the name following any
prefix) of section elements. The variable
<code>nxml-heading-element-name-regexp</code> gives a regexp for the
local names of heading elements. For an element to be recognized
as a section

     <ul>
<li>its start-tag must occur at the beginning of a line
(possibly indented);
<li>its local name must match
<code>nxml-section-element-name-regexp</code>;
<li>either its first child element or a descendant of that
first child element must have a local name that matches
<code>nxml-heading-element-name-regexp</code>; the first such element
is treated as the section's heading. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">You can customize these variables using <kbd>M-x
customize-variable</kbd>.

   <p>There are three possible outline states for a section:

     <ul>
<li>normal, showing everything, including its heading, text
content and subsections; each subsection is displayed according to the
state of that subsection;
<li>showing just its heading, with both its text content and
its subsections hidden; all subsections are hidden regardless of their
state;
<li>showing its heading and its subsections, with its text
content hidden; each subsection is displayed according to the state of
that subsection. 
</ul>

   <p>In the last two states, where the text content is hidden, the
heading is displayed specially, in an abbreviated form. An element
like this:

<pre class="example">     &lt;section&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Food&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;para&gt;There are many kinds of food.&lt;/para&gt;
     &lt;/section&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would be displayed on a single line like this:

<pre class="example">     &lt;-section&gt;Food...&lt;/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If there are hidden subsections, then a <code>+</code> will be used
instead of a <code>-</code> like this:

<pre class="example">     &lt;+section&gt;Food...&lt;/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If there are non-hidden subsections, then the section will instead be
displayed like this:

<pre class="example">     &lt;-section&gt;Food...
       &lt;-section&gt;Delicious Food...&lt;/&gt;
       &lt;-section&gt;Distasteful Food...&lt;/&gt;
     &lt;/-section&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The heading is always displayed with an indent that corresponds to its
depth in the outline, even it is not actually indented in the buffer. 
The variable <code>nxml-outline-child-indent</code> controls how much
a subheading is indented with respect to its parent heading when the
heading is being displayed specially.

   <p>Commands to change the outline state of sections are bound to
key sequences that start with <kbd>C-c C-o</kbd> (<kbd>o</kbd> is
mnemonic for outline).  The third and final key has been chosen to be
consistent with outline mode.  In the following descriptions
current section means the section containing point, or, more precisely,
the innermost section containing the character immediately following
point.

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-a</kbd> shows all sections in the buffer
normally. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-t</kbd> hides the text content
of all sections in the buffer. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-c</kbd> hides the text content
of the current section. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-e</kbd> shows the text content
of the current section. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-d</kbd> hides the text content
and subsections of the current section. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-s</kbd> shows the current section
and all its direct and indirect subsections normally. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-k</kbd> shows the headings of the
direct and indirect subsections of the current section. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-l</kbd> hides the text content of the
current section and of its direct and indirect
subsections. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-i</kbd> shows the headings of the
direct subsections of the current section. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-o</kbd> hides as much as possible without
hiding the current section's text content; the headings of ancestor
sections of the current section and their child section sections will
not be hidden. 
</ul>

   <p>When a heading is displayed specially, you can use
&lt;RET&gt; in that heading to show the text content of the section
in the same way as <kbd>C-c C-o C-e</kbd>.

   <p>You can also use the mouse to change the outline state:
<kbd>S-mouse-2</kbd> hides the text content of a section in the same
way as<kbd>C-c C-o C-c</kbd>; <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on a specially
displayed heading shows the text content of the section in the same
way as <kbd>C-c C-o C-e</kbd>; <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on a specially
displayed start-tag toggles the display of subheadings on and
off.

   <p>The outline state for each section is stored with the first
character of the section (as a text property). Every command that
changes the outline state of any section updates the display of the
buffer so that each section is displayed correctly according to its
outline state.  If the section structure is subsequently changed, then
it is possible for the display to no longer correctly reflect the
stored outline state. <kbd>C-c C-o C-r</kbd> can be used to refresh
the display so it is correct again.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Locating a schema</h2>

<p>nXML mode has a configurable set of rules to locate a schema for
the file being edited.  The rules are contained in one or more schema
locating files, which are XML documents.

   <p>The variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rng-schema-locating-files</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies
the list of the file-names of schema locating files that nXML mode
should use.  The order of the list is significant: when file
<var>x</var> occurs in the list before file <var>y</var> then rules
from file <var>x</var> have precedence over rules from file
<var>y</var>.  A filename specified in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rng-schema-locating-files</span></samp>&rsquo; may be relative. If so, it will
be resolved relative to the document for which a schema is being
located. It is not an error if relative file-names in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rng-schema-locating-files</span></samp>&rsquo; do not exist. You can use
<kbd>M-x customize-variable &lt;RET&gt; rng-schema-locating-files
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to customize the list of schema locating
files.

   <p>By default, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rng-schema-locating-files</span></samp>&rsquo; list has two
members: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schemas.xml</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp><var>dist-dir</var><span class="samp">/schema/schemas.xml</span></samp>&rsquo; where
&lsquo;<samp><var>dist-dir</var></samp>&rsquo; is the directory containing the nXML
distribution. The first member will cause nXML mode to use a file
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schemas.xml</span></samp>&rsquo; in the same directory as the document being
edited if such a file exist.  The second member contains rules for the
schemas that are included with the nXML distribution.

<h3 class="section">6.1 Commands for locating a schema</h3>

<p>The command <kbd>C-c C-s C-w</kbd> will tell you what schema
is currently being used.

   <p>The rules for locating a schema are applied automatically when
you visit a file in nXML mode. However, if you have just created a new
file and the schema cannot be inferred from the file-name, then this
will not locate the right schema.  In this case, you should insert the
start-tag of the root element and then use the command <kbd>C-c C-s
C-a</kbd>, which reapplies the rules based on the current content of
the document.  It is usually not necessary to insert the complete
start-tag; often just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span><var>name</var></samp>&rsquo; is
enough.

   <p>If you want to use a schema that has not yet been added to the
schema locating files, you can use the command <kbd>C-c C-s C-f</kbd>
to manually select the file containing the schema for the document in
current buffer.  Emacs will read the file-name of the schema from the
minibuffer. After reading the file-name, Emacs will ask whether you
wish to add a rule to a schema locating file that persistently
associates the document with the selected schema.  The rule will be
added to the first file in the list specified
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rng-schema-locating-files</span></samp>&rsquo;; it will create the file if
necessary, but will not create a directory. If the variable
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rng-schema-locating-files</span></samp>&rsquo; has not been customized, this
means that the rule will be added to the file &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schemas.xml</span></samp>&rsquo;
in the same directory as the document being edited.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-c C-s C-t</kbd> allows you to select a schema by
specifying an identifier for the type of the document.  The schema
locating files determine the available type identifiers and what
schema is used for each type identifier. This is useful when it is
impossible to infer the right schema from either the file-name or the
content of the document, even though the schema is already in the
schema locating file.  A situation in which this can occur is when
there are multiple variants of a schema where all valid documents have
the same document element.  For example, XHTML has Strict and
Transitional variants.  In a situation like this, a schema locating file
can define a type identifier for each variant. As with <kbd>C-c
C-s C-f</kbd>, Emacs will ask whether you wish to add a rule to a schema
locating file that persistently associates the document with the
specified type identifier.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-c C-s C-l</kbd> adds a rule to a schema
locating file that persistently associates the document with
the schema that is currently being used.

   <p>Schema locating files are designed to be useful for other

there is nothing specific to locating schemas in the design; it could
equally well be used for locating a stylesheet.

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.1 Schema locating file syntax basics</h4>

<p>There is a schema for schema locating files in the file
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">locate.rnc</span></samp>&rsquo; in the schema directory.  Schema locating
files must be valid with respect to this schema.

   <p>The document element of a schema locating file must be
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">locatingRules</span></samp>&rsquo; and the namespace URI must be
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The
children of the document element specify rules. The order of the
children is the same as the order of the rules.  Here's a complete
example of a schema locating file:

<pre class="example">     &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
     &lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0"&gt;
       &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml.rnc"/&gt;
       &lt;documentElement localName="book" uri="docbook.rnc"/&gt;
     &lt;/locatingRules&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This says to use the schema &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xhtml.rnc</span></samp>&rsquo; for a document with
namespace &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</span></samp>&rsquo;, and to use the
schema &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">docbook.rnc</span></samp>&rsquo; for a document whose local name is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">book</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If the document element had both a namespace URI
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</span></samp>&rsquo; and a local name of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">book</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the matching rule that comes first will be
used and so the schema &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xhtml.rnc</span></samp>&rsquo; would be used.  There is
no precedence between different types of rule; the first matching rule
of any type is used.

   <p>As usual with XML-related technologies, resources are identified
by URIs.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">uri</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute identifies the schema by
specifying the URI.  The URI may be relative.  If so, it is resolved
relative to the URI of the schema locating file that contains
attribute. This means that if the value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">uri</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute
does not contain a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;, then it will refer to a filename in
the same directory as the schema locating file.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.2 Using the document's URI to locate a schema</h4>

<p>A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">uri</span></samp>&rsquo; rule locates a schema based on the URI of the
document.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">uri</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute specifies the URI of the
schema.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">resource</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute can be used to specify
the schema for a particular document.  For example,

<pre class="example">     &lt;uri resource="spec.xml" uri="docbook.rnc"/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">specifies that the schema for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spec.xml</span></samp>&rsquo; is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">docbook.rnc</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pattern</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute can be used instead of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">resource</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute to specify the schema for any document
whose URI matches a pattern.  The pattern has the same syntax as an
absolute or relative URI except that the path component of the URI can
use a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; character to stand for zero or more characters
within a path segment (i.e., any character other &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
Typically, the URI pattern looks like a relative URI, but, whereas a
relative URI in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">resource</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute is resolved into a
particular absolute URI using the base URI of the schema locating
file, a relative URI pattern matches if it matches some number of
complete path segments of the document's URI ending with the last path
segment of the document's URI. For example,

<pre class="example">     &lt;uri pattern="*.xsl" uri="xslt.rnc"/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">specifies that the schema for documents with a URI whose path ends
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.xsl</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xslt.rnc</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">transformURI</span></samp>&rsquo; rule locates a schema by
transforming the URI of the document. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fromPattern</span></samp>&rsquo;
attribute specifies a URI pattern with the same meaning as the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pattern</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">uri</span></samp>&rsquo; element.  The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">toPattern</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute is a URI pattern that is used to
generate the URI of the schema.  Each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">toPattern</span></samp>&rsquo; is replaced by the string that matched the
corresponding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fromPattern</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The
resulting string is appended to the initial part of the document's URI
that was not explicitly matched by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fromPattern</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The
rule matches only if the transformed URI identifies an existing
resource.  For example, the rule

<pre class="example">     &lt;transformURI fromPattern="*.xml" toPattern="*.rnc"/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would transform the URI &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file:///home/jjc/docs/spec.xml</span></samp>&rsquo;
into the URI &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file:///home/jjc/docs/spec.rnc</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Thus, this
rule specifies that to locate a schema for a document
&lsquo;<samp><var>foo</var><span class="samp">.xml</span></samp>&rsquo;, Emacs should test whether a file
&lsquo;<samp><var>foo</var><span class="samp">.rnc</span></samp>&rsquo; exists in the same directory as
&lsquo;<samp><var>foo</var><span class="samp">.xml</span></samp>&rsquo;, and, if so, should use it as the
schema.

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.3 Using the document element to locate a schema</h4>

<p>A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">documentElement</span></samp>&rsquo; rule locates a schema based on
the local name and prefix of the document element. For example, a rule

<pre class="example">     &lt;documentElement prefix="xsl" localName="stylesheet" uri="xslt.rnc"/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">specifies that when the name of the document element is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xsl:stylesheet</span></samp>&rsquo;, then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xslt.rnc</span></samp>&rsquo; should be used
as the schema. Either the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prefix</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">localName</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute may be omitted to allow any prefix or
local name.

   <p>A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">namespace</span></samp>&rsquo; rule locates a schema based on the
namespace URI of the document element. For example, a rule

<pre class="example">     &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" uri="xslt.rnc"/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">specifies that when the namespace URI of the document is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform</span></samp>&rsquo;, then
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xslt.rnc</span></samp>&rsquo; should be used as the schema.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.4 Using type identifiers in schema locating files</h4>

<p>Type identifiers allow a level of indirection in locating the
schema for a document.  Instead of associating the document directly
with a schema URI, the document is associated with a type identifier,
which is in turn associated with a schema URI. nXML mode does not
constrain the format of type identifiers.  They can be simply strings
without any formal structure or they can be public identifiers or
URIs.  Note that these type identifiers have nothing to do with the
DOCTYPE declaration.  When comparing type identifiers, whitespace is
normalized in the same way as with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xsd:token</span></samp>&rsquo;
datatype: leading and trailing whitespace is stripped; other sequences
of whitespace are normalized to a single space character.

   <p>Each of the rules described in previous sections that uses a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">uri</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute to specify a schema, can instead use a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">typeId</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute to specify a type identifier.  The type
identifier can be associated with a URI using a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">typeId</span></samp>&rsquo;
element. For example,

<pre class="example">     &lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0"&gt;
       &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" typeId="XHTML"/&gt;
       &lt;typeId id="XHTML" typeId="XHTML Strict"/&gt;
       &lt;typeId id="XHTML Strict" uri="xhtml-strict.rnc"/&gt;
       &lt;typeId id="XHTML Transitional" uri="xhtml-transitional.rnc"/&gt;
     &lt;/locatingRules&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">declares three type identifiers &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">XHTML</span></samp>&rsquo; (representing the
default variant of XHTML to be used), &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">XHTML Strict</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">XHTML Transitional</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Such a schema locating file would
use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xhtml-strict.rnc</span></samp>&rsquo; for a document whose namespace is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</span></samp>&rsquo;.  But it is considerably
more flexible than a schema locating file that simply specified

<pre class="example">     &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml-strict.rnc"/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">A user can easily use <kbd>C-c C-s C-t</kbd> to select between XHTML
Strict and XHTML Transitional. Also, a user can easily add a catalog

<pre class="example">     &lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0"&gt;
       &lt;typeId id="XHTML" typeId="XHTML Transitional"/&gt;
     &lt;/locatingRules&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">that makes the default variant of XHTML be XHTML Transitional.

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.5 Using multiple schema locating files</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">include</span></samp>&rsquo; element includes rules from another
schema locating file.  The behavior is exactly as if the rules from
that file were included in place of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">include</span></samp>&rsquo; element. 
Relative URIs are resolved into absolute URIs before the inclusion is
performed. For example,

<pre class="example">     &lt;include rules="../rules.xml"/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">includes the rules from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rules.xml</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The process of locating a schema takes as input a list of schema
locating files.  The rules in all these files and in the files they
include are resolved into a single list of rules, which are applied
strictly in order.  Sometimes this order is not what is needed. 
For example, suppose you have two schema locating files, a private
file

<pre class="example">     &lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0"&gt;
       &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml.rnc"/&gt;
     &lt;/locatingRules&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">followed by a public file

<pre class="example">     &lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0"&gt;
       &lt;transformURI pathSuffix=".xml" replacePathSuffix=".rnc"/&gt;
       &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" typeId="XSLT"/&gt;
     &lt;/locatingRules&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The effect of these two files is that the XHTML &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">namespace</span></samp>&rsquo;
rule takes precedence over the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">transformURI</span></samp>&rsquo; rule, which
is almost certainly not what is needed.  This can be solved by adding
an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">applyFollowingRules</span></samp>&rsquo; to the private file.

<pre class="example">     &lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0"&gt;
       &lt;applyFollowingRules ruleType="transformURI"/&gt;
       &lt;namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml.rnc"/&gt;

<h2 class="chapter">7 DTDs</h2>

<p>nXML mode is designed to support the creation of standalone XML
documents that do not depend on a DTD.  Although it is common practice
to insert a DOCTYPE declaration referencing an external DTD, this has
undesirable side-effects.  It means that the document is no longer
self-contained. It also means that different XML parsers may interpret
the document in different ways, since the XML Recommendation does not
require XML parsers to read the DTD.  With DTDs, it was impractical to
get validation without using an external DTD or reference to an
parameter entity.  With RELAX NG and other schema languages, you can
simultaneously get the benefits of validation and standalone XML
documents.  Therefore, I recommend that you do not reference an
external DOCTYPE in your XML documents.

   <p>One problem is entities for characters. Typically, as well as
providing validation, DTDs also provide a set of character entities
for documents to use. Schemas cannot provide this functionality,
because schema validation happens after XML parsing.  The recommended
solution is to either use the Unicode characters directly, or, if this
is impractical, use character references.  nXML mode supports this by
providing commands for entering characters and character references
using the Unicode names, and can display the glyph corresponding to a
character reference.

subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
