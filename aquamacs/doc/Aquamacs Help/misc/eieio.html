<h2 class="chapter">1 Quick Start</h2>

<p><i>EIEIO</i> provides an Object Oriented layer for Emacs Lisp.  You can
use <i>EIEIO</i> to create classes, methods for those classes, and
instances of classes.

   <p>Here is a simple example of a class named <code>record</code>, containing
three slots named <code>name</code>, <code>birthday</code>, and <code>phone</code>:

<pre class="example">     (defclass record () ; No superclasses
       ((name :initarg :name
              :initform ""
              :type string
              :custom string
              :documentation "The name of a person.")
        (birthday :initarg :birthday
                  :initform "Jan 1, 1970"
                  :custom string
                  :type string
                  :documentation "The person's birthday.")
        (phone :initarg :phone
               :initform ""
               :documentation "Phone number."))
       "A single record for tracking people I know.")
</pre>
   <p>Each class can have methods, which are defined like this:

<pre class="example">     (defmethod call-record ((rec record) &amp;optional scriptname)
       "Dial the phone for the record REC.
     Execute the program SCRIPTNAME to dial the phone."
       (message "Dialing the phone for %s"  (oref rec name))
       (shell-command (concat (or scriptname "dialphone.sh")
                              " "
                              (oref rec phone))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, the first argument to <code>call-record</code> is a list,
of the form (<var>varname</var> <var>classname</var>).  <var>varname</var> is the
name of the variable used for the first argument; <var>classname</var> is
the name of the class that is expected as the first argument for this
method.

   <p><i>EIEIO</i> dispatches methods based on the type of the first argument. 
You can have multiple methods with the same name for different classes
of object.  When the <code>call-record</code> method is called, the first
argument is examined to determine the class of that argument, and the
method matching the input type is then executed.

   <p>Once the behavior of a class is defined, you can create a new
object of type <code>record</code>.  Objects are created by calling the
constructor.  The constructor is a function with the same name as your
class which returns a new instance of that class.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     (setq rec (record :name "Eric" :birthday "June" :phone "555-5555"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For backward compatibility reasons, the first argument can be a string (a name
given to this instance).  Each instance used to be given a name, so different
instances could be easily distinguished when debugging.

   <p>It can be a bit repetitive to also have a :name slot.  To avoid doing
this, it is sometimes handy to use the base class <code>eieio-named</code>. 
See <a href="#eieio_002dnamed">eieio-named</a>.

   <p>Calling methods on an object is a lot like calling any function.  The
first argument should be an object of a class which has had this
method defined for it.  In this example it would look like this:

<pre class="example">     (call-record rec)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or

<pre class="example">     (call-record rec "my-call-script")
</pre>
   <p>In these examples, <i>EIEIO</i> automatically examines the class of
<code>rec</code>, and ensures that the method defined above is called.  If
<code>rec</code> is some other class lacking a <code>call-record</code> method, or
some other data type, Emacs signals a <code>no-method-definition</code>
error.  <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Introduction</h2>

<p>First off, please note that this manual cannot serve as a complete
introduction to object oriented programming and generic functions in
LISP.  Although EIEIO is not a complete implementation of the Common
Lisp Object System (CLOS) and also differs from it in several aspects,
it follows the same basic concepts.  Therefore, it is highly
recommended to learn those from a textbook or tutorial first,
especially if you only know OOP from languages like C++ or Java.  If
on the other hand you are already familiar with CLOS, you should be
aware that <i>EIEIO</i> does not implement the full CLOS specification and
also differs in some other aspects which are mentioned below (also
see <a href="#CLOS-compatibility">CLOS compatibility</a>).

   <p><i>EIEIO</i> supports the following features:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>A structured framework for the creation of basic classes with attributes
and methods using singular inheritance similar to CLOS. 
<li>Type checking, and slot unbinding. 
<li>Method definitions similar to CLOS. 
<li>Simple and complex class browsers. 
<li>Edebug support for methods. 
<li>Imenu updates. 
<li>Byte compilation support of methods. 
<li>Help system extensions for classes and methods. 
<li>Several base classes for interesting tasks. 
<li>Simple test suite. 
<li>Public and private classifications for slots (extensions to CLOS)
<li>Customization support in a class (extension to CLOS)
        </ol>

   <p>Due to restrictions in the Emacs Lisp language, CLOS cannot be
completely supported, and a few functions have been added in place of
setf.  Here are some important CLOS features that <i>EIEIO</i> presently
lacks:

     <dl>
<dt>Method dispatch<dd>EIEO does not support method dispatch for built-in types and multiple
arguments types.  In other words, method dispatch only looks at the
first argument, and this one must be an <i>EIEIO</i> type.

     <br><dt>Support for metaclasses<dd>There is just one default metaclass, <code>eieio-default-superclass</code>,
and you cannot define your own.  The <code>:metaclass</code> tag in
<code>defclass</code> is ignored.  Also, functions like <code>find-class</code>, which
should return instances of the metaclass, behave differently in
<i>EIEIO</i> in that they return symbols or plain structures instead.

     <br><dt>EQL specialization<dd>EIEIO does not support it.

     <br><dt><code>:around</code> method tag<dd>This CLOS method tag is non-functional.

     <br><dt>:default-initargs in <code>defclass</code><dd>Each slot can have an <code>:initform</code> tag, so this is not really necessary.

     <br><dt>Mock object initializers<dd>Each class contains a mock object used for fast initialization of
instantiated objects.  Using functions with side effects on object slot
values can potentially cause modifications in the mock object.  <i>EIEIO</i>
should use a deep copy but currently does not.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Building Classes</h2>

<p>A <dfn>class</dfn> is a definition for organizing data and methods
together.  An <i>EIEIO</i> class has structures similar to the classes
found in other object-oriented (OO) languages.

   <p>To create a new class, use the <code>defclass</code> macro:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>defclass</b><var> class-name superclass-list slot-list &amp;rest options-and-doc<a name="index-defclass-1"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>Create a new class named <var>class-name</var>.  The class is represented
by a symbol with the name <var>class-name</var>.  <i>EIEIO</i> stores the structure of
the class as a symbol property of <var>class-name</var> (see <a href="elisp.html#Symbol-Components">Symbol Components</a>).

        <p>The <var>class-name</var> symbol's variable documentation string is a
modified version of the doc string found in <var>options-and-doc</var>. 
Each time a method is defined, the symbol's documentation string is
updated to include the methods documentation as well.

        <p>The parent classes for <var>class-name</var> is <var>superclass-list</var>. 
Each element of <var>superclass-list</var> must be a class.  These classes
are the parents of the class being created.  Every slot that appears
in each parent class is replicated in the new class.

        <p>If two parents share the same slot name, the parent which appears in
the <var>superclass-list</var> first sets the tags for that slot.  If the
new class has a slot with the same name as the parent, the new slot
overrides the parent's slot.

        <p>When overriding a slot, some slot attributes cannot be overridden
because they break basic OO rules.  You cannot override <code>:type</code>
or <code>:protection</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<p class="noindent">Whenever defclass is used to create a new class, a predicate is
created for it, named <var>CLASS-NAME</var><code>-p</code>:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>CLASS-NAME-p</b><var> object<a name="index-CLASS_002dNAME_002dp-2"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return non-<code>nil</code> if and only if <var>OBJECT</var> is of the class
<var>CLASS-NAME</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>eieio-error-unsupported-class-tags</b><var><a name="index-eieio_002derror_002dunsupported_002dclass_002dtags-3"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If non-<code>nil</code>, <code>defclass</code> signals an error if a tag in a slot
specifier is unsupported.

        <p>This option is here to support programs written with older versions of
<i>EIEIO</i>, which did not produce such errors.

<h3 class="section">3.1 Inheritance</h3>

<p><dfn>Inheritance</dfn> is a basic feature of an object-oriented language. 
In <i>EIEIO</i>, a defined class specifies the super classes from which it
inherits by using the second argument to <code>defclass</code>.  Here is an
example:

<pre class="example">     (defclass my-baseclass ()
        ((slot-A :initarg :slot-A)
         (slot-B :initarg :slot-B))
       "My Baseclass.")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To subclass from <code>my-baseclass</code>, we specify it in the superclass
list:

<pre class="example">     (defclass my-subclass (my-baseclass)
        ((specific-slot-A :initarg specific-slot-A)
         )
        "My subclass of my-baseclass")
</pre>
   <p class="indent">Instances of <code>my-subclass</code> will inherit <code>slot-A</code> and
<code>slot-B</code>, in addition to having <code>specific-slot-A</code> from the
declaration of <code>my-subclass</code>.

   <p><i>EIEIO</i> also supports multiple inheritance.  Suppose we define a
second baseclass, perhaps an &ldquo;interface&rdquo; class, like this:

<pre class="example">     (defclass my-interface ()
        ((interface-slot :initarg :interface-slot))
        "An interface to special behavior."
        :abstract t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The interface class defines a special <code>interface-slot</code>, and also
specifies itself as abstract.  Abstract classes cannot be
instantiated.  It is not required to make interfaces abstract, but it
is a good programming practice.

   <p>We can now modify our definition of <code>my-subclass</code> to use this
interface class, together with our original base class:

<pre class="example">     (defclass my-subclass (my-baseclass my-interface)
        ((specific-slot-A :initarg specific-slot-A)
         )
        "My subclass of my-baseclass")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">With this, <code>my-subclass</code> also has <code>interface-slot</code>.

   <p>If <code>my-baseclass</code> and <code>my-interface</code> had slots with the same
name, then the superclass showing up in the list first defines the
slot attributes.

   <p>Inheritance in <i>EIEIO</i> is more than just combining different slots. 
It is also important in method invocation.  <a href="#Methods">Methods</a>.

   <p>If a method is called on an instance of <code>my-subclass</code>, and that
method only has an implementation on <code>my-baseclass</code>, or perhaps
<code>my-interface</code>, then the implementation for the baseclass is
called.

   <p>If there is a method implementation for <code>my-subclass</code>, and
another in <code>my-baseclass</code>, the implementation for
<code>my-subclass</code> can call up to the superclass as well.

</div>

<h3 class="section">3.2 Slot Options</h3>

<p>The <var>slot-list</var> argument to <code>defclass</code> is a list of elements
where each element defines one slot.  Each slot is a list of the form

<pre class="example">       (SLOT-NAME :TAG1 ATTRIB-VALUE1
                  :TAG2 ATTRIB-VALUE2
                  :TAGN ATTRIB-VALUEN)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>SLOT-NAME</var> is a symbol that will be used to refer to the
slot.  <var>:TAG</var> is a symbol that describes a feature to be set
on the slot.  <var>ATTRIB-VALUE</var> is a lisp expression that will be
used for <var>:TAG</var>.

   <p>Valid tags are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>:initarg</code><dd>A symbol that can be used in the argument list of the constructor to
specify a value for this slot of the new instance being created.

     <p>A good symbol to use for initarg is one that starts with a colon <code>:</code>.

     <p>The slot specified like this:
     <pre class="example">            (myslot :initarg :myslot)
</pre>
     <p>could then be initialized to the number 1 like this:
     <pre class="example">            (myobject :myslot 1)
</pre>
     <p>See <a href="#Making-New-Objects">Making New Objects</a>.

     <br><dt><code>:initform</code><dd>An expression used as the default value for this slot.

     <p>If <code>:initform</code> is left out, that slot defaults to being unbound. 
It is an error to reference an unbound slot, so if you need
slots to always be in a bound state, you should always use an
<code>:initform</code> specifier.

     <p>Use <code>slot-boundp</code> to test if a slot is unbound
(see <a href="#Predicates">Predicates</a>).  Use <code>slot-makeunbound</code> to set a slot to
being unbound after giving it a value (see <a href="#Accessing-Slots">Accessing Slots</a>).

     <p>The value passed to initform used to be automatically quoted.  Thus,
     <pre class="example">          :initform (1 2 3)
</pre>
     <p>will use the list as a value.  This is incompatible with CLOS (which would
signal an error since 1 is not a valid function) and will likely change in the
future, so better quote your initforms if they're just values.

     <br><dt><code>:type</code><dd>An unquoted type specifier used to validate data set into this slot. 
See <a href="cl.html#Type-Predicates">Type Predicates</a>. 
Here are some examples:
          <dl>
 <dt><code>symbol</code><dd> A symbol. 
 <br><dt><code>number</code><dd> A number type
 <br><dt><code>my-class-name</code><dd> An object of your class type. 
 <br><dt><code>(or null symbol)</code><dd> A symbol, or <code>nil</code>. 
 </dl>

     <br><dt><code>:allocation</code><dd>Either :class or :instance (defaults to :instance) used to
specify how data is stored.  Slots stored per instance have unique
values for each object.  Slots stored per class have shared values for
each object.  If one object changes a :class allocated slot, then all
objects for that class gain the new value.

     <br><dt><code>:documentation</code><dd>Documentation detailing the use of this slot.  This documentation is
exposed when the user describes a class, and during customization of an
object.

     <br><dt><code>:accessor</code><dd>Name of a generic function which can be used to fetch the value of this slot. 
You can call this function later on your object and retrieve the value
of the slot.

     <p>This options is in the CLOS spec, but is not fully compliant in <i>EIEIO</i>.

     <br><dt><code>:writer</code><dd>Name of a generic function which will write this slot.

     <p>This options is in the CLOS spec, but is not fully compliant in <i>EIEIO</i>.

     <br><dt><code>:reader</code><dd>Name of a generic function which will read this slot.

     <p>This options is in the CLOS spec, but is not fully compliant in <i>EIEIO</i>.

     <br><dt><code>:custom</code><dd>A custom :type specifier used when editing an object of this type. 
See documentation for <code>defcustom</code> for details.  This specifier is
equivalent to the :type spec of a <code>defcustom</code> call.

     <p>This options is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

     <br><dt><code>:label</code><dd>When customizing an object, the value of :label will be used instead
of the slot name.  This enables better descriptions of the data than
would usually be afforded.

     <p>This options is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

     <br><dt><code>:group</code><dd>Similar to <code>defcustom</code>'s :group command, this organizes different
slots in an object into groups.  When customizing an object, only the
slots belonging to a specific group need be worked with, simplifying the
size of the display.

     <p>This options is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

     <br><dt><code>:printer</code><dd>This routine takes a symbol which is a function name.  The function
should accept one argument.  The argument is the value from the slot
to be printed.  The function in <code>object-write</code> will write the
slot value out to a printable form on <code>standard-output</code>.

     <p>The output format MUST be something that could in turn be interpreted
with <code>read</code> such that the object can be brought back in from the
output stream.  Thus, if you wanted to output a symbol, you would need
to quote the symbol.  If you wanted to run a function on load, you
can output the code to do the construction of the value.

     <br><dt><code>:protection</code><dd>This is an old option that is not supported any more.

     <p>When using a slot referencing function such as <code>slot-value</code>, and
the value behind <var>slot</var> is private or protected, then the current
scope of operation must be within a method of the calling object.

     <p>This protection is not enforced by the code any more, so it's only useful
as documentation.

     <p>Valid values are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>:public</code><dd>Access this slot from any scope. 
<br><dt><code>:protected</code><dd>Access this slot only from methods of the same class or a child class. 
<br><dt><code>:private</code><dd>Access this slot only from methods of the same class. 
</dl>

     <p>This options is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

prefixed by the <code>:documentation</code> tag, and appears after the list
of slots, and before the options.

     <br><dt><code>:allow-nil-initform</code><dd>If this option is non-<code>nil</code>, and the <code>:initform</code> is <code>nil</code>, but
the <code>:type</code> is specifies something such as <code>string</code> then allow
this to pass.  The default is to have this option be off.  This is
implemented as an alternative to unbound slots.

     <p>This options is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

     <br><dt><code>:abstract</code><dd>A class which is <code>:abstract</code> cannot be instantiated, and instead
is used to define an interface which subclasses should implement.

     <p>This option is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

     <br><dt><code>:custom-groups</code><dd>This is a list of groups that can be customized within this class.  This
slot is auto-generated when a class is created and need not be
specified.  It can be retrieved with the <code>class-option</code> command,
however, to see what groups are available.

     <p>This option is specific to Emacs, and is not in the CLOS spec.

     <br><dt><code>:method-invocation-order</code><dd>This controls the order in which method resolution occurs for
<code>:primary</code> methods in cases of multiple inheritance.  The order
affects which method is called first in a tree, and if
<code>call-next-method</code> is used, it controls the order in which the
stack of methods are run.

     <p>Valid values are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>:breadth-first</code><dd>Search for methods in the class hierarchy in breadth first order. 
This is the default. 
<br><dt><code>:depth-first</code><dd>Search for methods in the class hierarchy in a depth first order. 
<br><dt><code>:c3</code><dd>Searches for methods in a linearized way that most closely matches
what CLOS does when a monotonic class structure is defined.

than <code>standard-class</code>.

     <br><dt><code>:default-initargs</code><dd>Unsupported CLOS option.  Specifies a list of initargs to be used when

<h2 class="chapter">4 Making New Objects</h2>

<p>Suppose we have a simple class is defined, such as:

<pre class="example">     (defclass record ()
        ( ) "Doc String")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It is now possible to create objects of that class type.

   <p>Calling <code>defclass</code> has defined two new functions.  One is the
constructor <var>record</var>, and the other is the predicate,
<var>record</var>-p.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>record</b><var> object-name &amp;rest slots<a name="index-record-4"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>This creates and returns a new object.  This object is not assigned to
anything, and will be garbage collected if not saved.  This object
will be given the string name <var>object-name</var>.  There can be
multiple objects of the same name, but the name slot provides a handy
way to keep track of your objects.  <var>slots</var> is just all the slots
you wish to preset.  Any slot set as such <em>will not</em> get its
default value, and any side effects from a slot's <code>:initform</code>
that may be a function will not occur.

        <p>An example pair would appear simply as <code>:value 1</code>.  Of course you
can do any valid Lispy thing you want with it, such as
<code>:value (if (boundp 'special-symbol) special-symbol nil)</code>

        <p>Example of creating an object from a class:

     <pre class="example">          (record :value 3 :reference nil)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>To create an object from a class symbol, use <code>make-instance</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>make-instance</b><var> class &amp;rest initargs<a name="index-make_002dinstance-5"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="make_002dinstance"></a>Make a new instance of <var>class</var> based on <var>initargs</var>. 
<var>class</var> is a class symbol.  For example:

     <pre class="example">            (make-instance 'foo)
</pre>
        <p><var>initargs</var> is a property list with keywords based on the <code>:initarg</code>
for each slot.  For example:

     <pre class="example">            (make-instance <code>'foo</code> <code>:slot1</code> value1 <code>:slotN</code> valueN)
</pre>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Accessing Slots</h2>

<p>There are several ways to access slot values in an object.  The naming
and argument-order conventions are similar to those used for
referencing vectors (see <a href="elisp.html#Vectors">Vectors</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>oset</b><var> object slot value<a name="index-oset-6"></a></var><br>

<blockquote><p>This macro sets the value for the class-allocated <var>slot</var> in <var>class</var> to
<var>value</var>.

        <p>For example, if a user wanted all <code>data-objects</code> (see <a href="#Building-Classes">Building Classes</a>) to inform a special object of his own devising when they
changed, this can be arranged by simply executing this bit of code:

     <pre class="example">          (oset-default data-object reference (list my-special-object))

slot values, and use the previously mentioned set/ref routines.

<div class="defun">

<h2 class="chapter">6 Writing Methods</h2>

<p>Writing a method in <i>EIEIO</i> is similar to writing a function.  The
differences are that there are some extra options and there can be
multiple definitions under the same function symbol.

   <p>Where a method defines an implementation for a particular data type, a
<dfn>generic method</dfn> accepts any argument, but contains no code.  It
is used to provide the dispatching to the defined methods.  A generic
method has no body, and is merely a symbol upon which methods are
attached.  It also provides the base documentation for what methods
with that name do.

<ul class="menu">

</div>

<h3 class="section">6.1 Generics</h3>

<p>Each <i>EIEIO</i> method has one corresponding generic.  This generic
provides a function binding and the base documentation for the method
symbol (see <a href="elisp.html#Symbol-Components">Symbol Components</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>defgeneric</b><var> method arglist </var>[<var>doc-string</var>]<var><a name="index-defgeneric-16"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro turns the (unquoted) symbol <var>method</var> into a function. 
<var>arglist</var> is the default list of arguments to use (not implemented
yet).  <var>doc-string</var> is the documentation used for this symbol.

        <p>A generic function acts as a placeholder for methods.  There is no
need to call <code>defgeneric</code> yourself, as <code>defmethod</code> will call
it if necessary.  Currently the argument list is unused.

        <p><code>defgeneric</code> signals an error if you attempt to turn an existing
Emacs Lisp function into a generic function.

        <p>You can also create a generic method with <code>defmethod</code>
(see <a href="#Methods">Methods</a>).  When a method is created and there is no generic
method in place with that name, then a new generic will be created,
and the new method will use it. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>In CLOS, a generic call also be used to provide an argument list and
dispatch precedence for all the arguments.  In <i>EIEIO</i>, dispatching
only occurs for the first argument, so the <var>arglist</var> is not used.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Methods</h3>

<p>A method is a function that is executed if the first argument passed
to it matches the method's class.  Different <i>EIEIO</i> classes may
share the same method names.

   <p>Methods are created with the <code>defmethod</code> macro, which is similar
to <code>defun</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>defmethod</b><var> method </var>[<var>:before | :primary | :after | :static </var>]<var> arglist </var>[<var>doc-string</var>]<var> forms<a name="index-defmethod-17"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p><var>method</var> is the name of the function to create.

        <p><code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> specify execution order (i.e., when
this form is called).  If neither of these symbols are present, the
default priority is used (before <code>:after</code> and after
<code>:before</code>); this default priority is represented in CLOS as
<code>:primary</code>.

        <p><b>Note:</b> The <code>:BEFORE</code>, <code>:PRIMARY</code>, <code>:AFTER</code>, and
<code>:STATIC</code> method tags were in all capital letters in previous
versions of <i>EIEIO</i>.

        <p><var>arglist</var> is the list of arguments to this method.  The first
argument in this list&mdash;and <em>only</em> the first argument&mdash;may have
a type specifier (see the example below).  If no type specifier is
supplied, the method applies to any object.

        <p><var>doc-string</var> is the documentation attached to the implementation. 
All method doc-strings are incorporated into the generic method's
function documentation.

        <p><var>forms</var> is the body of the function.

        </blockquote></div>

<p class="noindent">In the following example, we create a method <code>mymethod</code> for the
<code>classname</code> class:

<pre class="example">     (defmethod mymethod ((obj classname) secondarg)
       "Doc string" )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This method only executes if the <var>obj</var> argument passed to it is an
<i>EIEIO</i> object of class <code>classname</code>.

   <p>A method with no type specifier is a <dfn>default method</dfn>.  If a given
class has no implementation, then the default method is called when
that method is used on a given object of that class.

   <p>Only one default method per execution specifier (<code>:before</code>,
<code>:primary</code>, or <code>:after</code>) is allowed.  If two
<code>defmethod</code>s appear with <var>arglist</var>s lacking a type specifier,
and having the same execution specifier, then the first implementation
is replaced.

   <p>When a method is called on an object, but there is no method specified
for that object, but there is a method specified for object's parent
class, the parent class' method is called.  If there is a method
defined for both, only the child's method is called.  A child method
may call a parent's method using <code>call-next-method</code>, described
below.

   <p>If multiple methods and default methods are defined for the same
method and class, they are executed in this order:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>method :before
<li>default :before
<li>method :primary
<li>default :primary
<li>method :after
<li>default :after
        </ol>

   <p>If no methods exist, Emacs signals a <code>no-method-definition</code>
error.  See <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>.

        <p>If <var>replacement-args</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then use them instead of
<code>eieio-generic-call-arglst</code>.  At the top level, the generic
argument list is passed in.

        <p>Use <code>next-method-p</code> to find out if there is a next method to

   <p>At present, <i>EIEIO</i> does not implement all the features of CLOS:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>There is currently no <code>:around</code> tag.

<h3 class="section">6.3 Static Methods</h3>

<p>Static methods do not depend on an object instance, but instead
operate on a class.  You can create a static method by using
the <code>:static</code> key with <code>defmethod</code>.

   <p>The first argument of a <code>:static</code> method will be a class rather than an
object.  Use the functions <code>oref-default</code> or <code>oset-default</code> which
will work on a class.

   <p>A class's <code>make-instance</code> method is defined as a <code>:static</code>
method.

   <p><b>Note:</b> The <code>:static</code> keyword is unique to <i>EIEIO</i>.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Method Invocation</h2>

<p>When classes are defined, you can specify the
<code>:method-invocation-order</code>.  This is a feature specific to EIEIO.

   <p>This controls the order in which method resolution occurs for
<code>:primary</code> methods in cases of multiple inheritance.  The order
affects which method is called first in a tree, and if
<code>call-next-method</code> is used, it controls the order in which the
stack of methods are run.

   <p>The original EIEIO order turned out to be broken for multiple
inheritance, but some programs depended on it.  As such this option
was added when the default invocation order was fixed to something
that made more sense in that case.

   <p>Valid values are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>:breadth-first</code><dd>Search for methods in the class hierarchy in breadth first order. 
This is the default. 
<br><dt><code>:depth-first</code><dd>Search for methods in the class hierarchy in a depth first order. 
<br><dt><code>:c3</code><dd>Searches for methods in a linearized way that most closely matches
what CLOS does when a monotonic class structure is defined.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Association Lists</h2>

<p>Lisp offers the concept of association lists, with primitives such as
<code>assoc</code> used to access them.  The following functions can be used
to manage association lists of <i>EIEIO</i> objects:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>object-assoc</b><var> key slot list<a name="index-object_002dassoc-39"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="object_002dassoc"></a>Return an object if <var>key</var> is <dfn>equal</dfn> to SLOT's value of an object in <var>list</var>. 
<var>list</var> is a list of objects whose slots are searched. 
Objects in <var>list</var> do not need to have a slot named <var>slot</var>, nor does
<var>slot</var> need to be bound.  If these errors occur, those objects will
be ignored. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>object-assoc-list</b><var> slot list<a name="index-object_002dassoc_002dlist-40"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return an association list generated by extracting <var>slot</var> from all

<h2 class="chapter">10 Customizing Objects</h2>

<p><i>EIEIO</i> supports the Custom facility through two new widget types. 
If a variable is declared as type <code>object</code>, then full editing of
slots via the widgets is made possible.  This should be used
carefully, however, because modified objects are cloned, so if there
are other references to these objects, they will no longer be linked
together.

   <p>If you want in place editing of objects, use the following methods:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>eieio-customize-object</b><var> object<a name="index-eieio_002dcustomize_002dobject-42"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Create a custom buffer and insert a widget for editing <var>object</var>.  At
the end, an <code>Apply</code> and <code>Reset</code> button are available.  This
will edit the object "in place" so references to it are also changed. 
There is no effort to prevent multiple edits of a singular object, so
care must be taken by the user of this function. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>eieio-custom-widget-insert</b><var> object flags<a name="index-eieio_002dcustom_002dwidget_002dinsert-43"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This method inserts an edit object into the current buffer in place. 
It is implemented as <code>(widget-create 'object-edit :value object)</code>. 
This method is provided as a locale for adding tracking, or
specializing the widget insert procedure for any object. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>To define a slot with an object in it, use the <code>object</code> tag.  This
widget type will be automatically converted to <code>object-edit</code> if you
do in place editing of you object.

   <p>If you want to have additional actions taken when a user clicks on the
<code>Apply</code> button, then overload the method <code>eieio-done-customizing</code>. 
This method does nothing by default, but that may change in the future. 
This would be the best way to make your objects persistent when using
in-place editing.

<h3 class="section">10.1 Widget extension</h3>

<p>When widgets are being created, one new widget extension has been added,
called the <code>:slotofchoices</code>.  When this occurs in a widget
definition, all elements after it are removed, and the slot is specifies
is queried and converted into a series of constants.

<pre class="example">     (choice (const :tag "None" nil)
             :slotofchoices morestuff)
</pre>
   <p>and if the slot <code>morestuff</code> contains <code>(sym1 sym2 sym3)</code>, the
above example is converted into:

<pre class="example">     (choice (const :tag "None" nil)
             (const sym1)
             (const sym2)
             (const sym3))
</pre>
   <p>This is useful when a given item needs to be selected from a list of
items defined in this second slot.

some functions have been provided.  None of these functions are a part
of CLOS.

<h2 class="chapter">12 Base Classes</h2>

<p>All defined classes, if created with no specified parent class,
inherit from a special class called <code>eieio-default-superclass</code>. 
See <a href="#Default-Superclass">Default Superclass</a>.

   <p>Often, it is more convenient to inherit from one of the other base
classes provided by <i>EIEIO</i>, which have useful pre-defined
properties.  (Since <i>EIEIO</i> supports multiple inheritance, you can
even inherit from more than one of these classes at once.)

<p>This class is defined in the package <samp><span class="file">eieio-base</span></samp>.

   <p>Instance inheritance is a mechanism whereby the value of a slot in
object instance can reference the parent instance.  If the parent's slot
value is changed, then the child instance is also changed.  If the
child's slot is set, then the parent's slot is not modified.

<div class="defun">

<p>The command <kbd>M-x eieio-browse</kbd> displays a buffer listing all the

indented tree structure, starting from <code>eieio-default-superclass</code>
(see <a href="#Default-Superclass">Default Superclass</a>).

   <p>With a prefix argument, this command prompts for a class name; it then
lists only that class and its subclasses.

   <p>Here is a sample tree from our current example:

<h2 class="chapter">15 Default Superclass</h2>

<p>All defined classes, if created with no specified parent class, will
inherit from a special class stored in
<code>eieio-default-superclass</code>.  This superclass is quite simple, but
with it, certain default methods or attributes can be added to all
objects.  In CLOS, this would be named <code>STANDARD-CLASS</code>, and that
symbol is an alias to <code>eieio-default-superclass</code>.

   <p>Currently, the default superclass is defined as follows:

<pre class="example">     (defclass eieio-default-superclass nil
       nil
       "Default parent class for classes with no specified parent class.
     Its slots are automatically adopted by classes with no specified
     parents.  This class is not stored in the `parent' slot of a class vector."
       :abstract t)
</pre>
   <p>The default superclass implements several methods providing a default
behavior for all objects created by <i>EIEIO</i>.

<h3 class="section">15.1 Initialization</h3>

<p>When creating an object of any type, you can use its constructor, or
<code>make-instance</code>.  This, in turns calls the method
<code>initialize-instance</code>, which then calls the method
<code>shared-initialize</code>.

   <p>These methods are all implemented on the default superclass so you do
not need to write them yourself, unless you need to override one of
their behaviors.

   <p>Users should not need to call <code>initialize-instance</code> or
<code>shared-initialize</code>, as these are used by <code>make-instance</code> to
initialize the object.  They are instead provided so that users can
augment these behaviors.

<div class="defun">

        <p>It is sometimes useful to put a summary of the object into the
default #&lt;notation&gt; string when using eieio browsing tools.

        <p>Implement this function and specify <var>strings</var> in a call to
<dfn>call-next-method</dfn> to provide additional summary information. 
When passing in extra strings from child classes, always remember
to prepend a space.

     <pre class="example">          (defclass data-object ()

<p>The default superclass defines methods for managing error conditions. 
These methods all throw a signal for a particular error condition.

   <p>By implementing one of these methods for a class, you can change the
behavior that occurs during one of these error cases, or even ignore
the error by providing some behavior.

<div class="defun">

that was requested, and optional <var>new-value</var> is the value that was desired
to be set.

        <p>This method is called from <code>oref</code>, <code>oset</code>, and other functions which
directly reference slots in EIEIO objects.

        <p>The default method signals an error of type <code>invalid-slot-name</code>. 
See <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>.

        <p>You may override this behavior, but it is not expected to return in the

<h2 class="chapter">16 Signals</h2>

<p>There are new condition names (signals) that can be caught when using
<i>EIEIO</i>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Signal: <b>invalid-slot-name</b><var> obj-or-class slot<a name="index-invalid_002dslot_002dname-80"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This signal is called when an attempt to reference a slot in an

it.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Signal: <b>no-method-definition</b><var> method arguments<a name="index-no_002dmethod_002ddefinition-81"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This signal is called when <var>method</var> is called, with <var>arguments</var>

which method body to run.

        <p>To prevent this signal from occurring in your class, implement the
method <code>no-applicable-method</code> for your class.  This method is
called when to throw this signal, so implementing this for your class
allows you block the signal, and perform some work.

<h2 class="chapter">17 Naming Conventions</h2>

<p>See <a href="elisp.html#Tips">Tips and Conventions</a>, for a description of Emacs Lisp programming conventions. 
These conventions help ensure that Emacs packages work nicely one
another, so an <i>EIEIO</i>-based program should follow them.  Here are
some conventions that apply specifically to <i>EIEIO</i>-based programs:

     <ul>
<li>Come up with a package prefix that is relatively short.  Prefix
all classes, and methods with your prefix.  This is a standard
convention for functions and variables in Emacs.

     <li>Do not prefix method names with the class name.  All methods in
<i>EIEIO</i> are &ldquo;virtual&rdquo;, and are dynamically dispatched.  Anyone can
override your methods at any time.  Your methods should be prefixed
with your package name.

     <li>Do not prefix slots in your class.  The slots are always locally
scoped to your class, and need no prefixing.

     <li>If your library inherits from other libraries of classes, you
must &ldquo;require&rdquo; that library with the <code>require</code> command.

   </ul>

<h2 class="chapter">18 CLOS compatibility</h2>

<p>Currently, the following functions should behave almost as expected from
CLOS.

     <dl>
<dt><code>defclass</code><dd>All slot keywords are available but not all work correctly. 
Slot keyword differences are:

          <dl>
<dt>:reader, and :writer tags<dd>Create methods that signal errors instead of creating an unqualified
method.  You can still create new ones to do its business.

          <br><dt>:accessor<dd>This should create an unqualified method to access a slot, but
instead pre-builds a method that gets the slot's value.

          <br><dt>:type<dd>Specifier uses the <code>typep</code> function from the <samp><span class="file">cl</span></samp>
package.  See <a href="cl.html#Type-Predicates">Type Predicates</a>. 
It therefore has the same issues as that package.  Extensions include
the ability to provide object names. 
</dl>

     <p>defclass also supports class options, but does not currently use values
of <code>:metaclass</code>, and <code>:default-initargs</code>.

     <br><dt><code>make-instance</code><dd>Make instance works as expected, however it just uses the <i>EIEIO</i> instance
creator automatically generated when a new class is created. 
See <a href="#Making-New-Objects">Making New Objects</a>.

     <br><dt><code>defgeneric</code><dd>Creates the desired symbol, and accepts all of the expected arguments
except <code>:around</code>.

     <br><dt><code>defmethod</code><dd>Calls defgeneric, and accepts most of the expected arguments.  Only
the first argument to the created method may have a type specifier. 
To type cast against a class, the class must exist before defmethod is
called.  In addition, the <code>:around</code> tag is not supported.

     <br><dt><code>call-next-method</code><dd>Inside a method, calls the next available method up the inheritance tree
for the given object.  This is different than that found in CLOS because
in <i>EIEIO</i> this function accepts replacement arguments.  This permits
subclasses to modify arguments as they are passed up the tree.  If no
arguments are given, the expected CLOS behavior is used. 
</dl>

   <p>CLOS supports the <code>describe</code> command, but <i>EIEIO</i> provides
support for using the standard <code>describe-function</code> command on a
constructor or generic function.

   <p>When creating a new class (see <a href="#Building-Classes">Building Classes</a>) there are several
new keywords supported by <i>EIEIO</i>.

   <p>In <i>EIEIO</i> tags are in lower case, not mixed case.

<h2 class="chapter">19 Wish List</h2>

<p><i>EIEIO</i> is an incomplete implementation of CLOS.  Finding ways to
improve the compatibility would help make CLOS style programs run
better in Emacs.

   <p>Some important compatibility features that would be good to add are:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Support for metaclasses and EQL specialization. 
<li><code>:around</code> method key. 
<li>Method dispatch for built-in types. 
<li>Method dispatch for multiple argument typing. 
<li>Improve integration with the <samp><span class="file">cl</span></samp> package.
        </ol>

   <p>There are also improvements to be made to allow <i>EIEIO</i> to operate
better in the Emacs environment.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Allow subclassing of Emacs built-in types, such as faces, markers, and
buffers. 
<li>Allow method overloading of method-like functions in Emacs.

publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
