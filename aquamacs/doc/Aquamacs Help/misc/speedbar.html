<h2 class="unnumbered">Speedbar</h2>

<p>Speedbar is a program for Emacs which can be used to summarize
information related to the current buffer.  Its original inspiration
is the &ldquo;explorer&rdquo; often used in modern development environments, office
packages, and web browsers.

   <p>Speedbar displays a narrow frame in which a tree view is shown.  This
tree view defaults to containing a list of files and directories.  Files
can be &ldquo;expanded&rdquo; to list tags inside. Directories can be expanded to
list the files within itself.  Each file or tag can be jumped to
immediately.

   <p>Speedbar expands upon &ldquo;explorer&rdquo; windows by maintaining context with the
user.  For example, when using the file view, the current buffer's file
is highlighted.  Speedbar also mimics the explorer windows by providing
multiple display modes.  These modes come in two flavors.  Major display
modes remain consistent across buffers, and minor display modes appear
only when a buffer of the applicable type is shown.  This allows
authors of other packages to provide speedbar summaries customized to
the needs of that mode.

   <p>Throughout this manual, activities are defined as &ldquo;clicking on&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;expanding&rdquo; items.  Clicking means using <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> on a
button.  Expanding refers to clicking on an expansion button to display
an expanded summary of the entry the expansion button is
on.  See <a href="#Basic-Navigation">Basic Navigation</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-introduction-1"></a>
To start using speedbar use the command <kbd>M-x speedbar RET</kbd> or
select it from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Options-&gt;Show/Hide</span></samp>&rsquo; sub-menu.  This command
will open a new frame to summarize the local files.  On X Window
systems or on MS-Windows, speedbar's frame is twenty characters wide,
and will mimic the height of the frame from which it was started.  It
positions itself to the left or right of the frame you started it
from.

   <p>To use speedbar effectively, it is important to understand its
relationship with the frame you started it from.  This frame is the
<dfn>attached frame</dfn> which speedbar will use as a reference point.  Once
started, speedbar watches the contents of this frame, and attempts to
make its contents relevant to the buffer loaded into the attached
frame.  In addition, all requests made in speedbar that require the
display of another buffer will display in the attached frame.

   <p>When used in terminal mode, the new frame appears the same size as the
terminal.  Since it is not visible while working in the attached frame,
speedbar will save time by using the <dfn>slowbar mode</dfn>, where no tracking is
done until speedbar is requested to show itself (i.e., the speedbar's
frame becomes the selected frame).

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dget_002dfocus_007d-2"></a>The function to use when switching between frames using the keyboard is
<code>speedbar-get-focus</code>.  This function will toggle between frames, and
it's useful to bind it to a key in terminal mode.  See <a href="#Customizing">Customizing</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Basic Navigation</h2>

<p>Speedbar can display different types of data, and has several display
and behavior modes.  These modes all have a common behavior, menu
system, and look.  If one mode is learned, then the other modes are easy
to use.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Basic Key Bindings</h3>

<p><a name="index-key-bindings-3"></a>
These key bindings are common across all modes:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>Q</kbd><dd><a name="index-quitting-speedbar-4"></a>Quit speedbar, and kill the frame. 
<br><dt><kbd>q</kbd><dd>Quit speedbar, and hide the frame.  This makes it faster to restore the
speedbar frame, than if you press <kbd>Q</kbd>. 
<br><dt><kbd>g</kbd><dd><a name="index-refresh-speedbar-display-5"></a>Refresh whatever contents are in speedbar. 
<br><dt><kbd>t</kbd><dd><a name="index-slowbar-mode-6"></a>Toggle speedbar to and from slowbar mode.  In slowbar mode, frame
tracking is not done. 
<br><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd><a name="index-navigation-7"></a>Move, respectively, to the next or previous item.  A summary of that
item will be displayed in the attached frame's minibuffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-n</kbd><dt><kbd>M-p</kbd><dd>Move to the next or previous item in a restricted fashion.  If a list is
open, the cursor will skip over it.  If the cursor is in an open list,
it will not leave it. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-n</kbd><dt><kbd>C-M-p</kbd><dd>Move forwards and backwards across extended groups.  This lets you
quickly skip over all files, directories, or other common sub-items at
the same current depth. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x b</kbd><dd>Switch buffers in the attached frame. 
</dl>

   <p>Speedbar can handle multiple modes.  Two are provided by default. 
These modes are File mode, and Buffers mode.  There are accelerators to
switch into these different modes.

   <p><a name="index-mode-switching-hotkeys-8"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>b</kbd><dd>Switch into Quick Buffers mode (see <a href="#Buffer-Mode">Buffer Mode</a>).  After one use, the
previous display mode is restored. 
<br><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>Switch into File mode. 
<br><dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd>Switch back to the previous mode. 
</dl>

   <p>Some modes provide groups, lists and tags.  See <a href="#Basic-Visuals">Basic Visuals</a>.  When
these are available, some additional common bindings are available.

   <p><a name="index-common-keys-9"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>RET</kbd><dt><kbd>e</kbd><dd>Edit/Open the current group or tag.  This behavior is dependent on the
mode.  In general, files or buffers are opened in the attached frame,
and directories or group nodes are expanded locally. 
<br><dt><kbd>+</kbd><dt><kbd>=</kbd><dd>Expand the current group, displaying sub items. 
When used with a prefix argument, any data that may have been cached is
flushed.  This is similar to a power click.  See <a href="#Mouse-Bindings">Mouse Bindings</a>. 
<br><dt><kbd>-</kbd><dd>Contract the current group, hiding sub items. 
</dl>

<h3 class="section">2.2 Basic Visuals</h3>

<p><a name="index-visuals-10"></a>
Speedbar has visual cues for indicating different types of data.  These
cues are used consistently across the different speedbar modes to make
them easier to interpret.

   <p>At a high level, in File mode, there are directory buttons, sub
directory buttons, file buttons, tag buttons, and expansion buttons. 
This makes it easy to use the mouse to navigate a directory tree, and
quickly view files, or a summary of those files.

   <p>The most basic visual effect used to distinguish between these button
types is color and mouse highlighting.  Anything the mouse highlights
can be clicked on and is called a button (see <a href="#Mouse-Bindings">Mouse Bindings</a>). 
Anything not highlighted by the mouse will not be clickable.

   <p>Text in speedbar consists of four different types of data.  Knowing how
to read these textual elements will make it easier to navigate by
identifying the types of data available.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 Groups</h4>

<p><a name="index-groups-11"></a>
Groups summarize information in a single line, and provide a high level
view of more complex systems, like a directory tree, or manual chapters.

   <p>Groups appear at different indentation levels, and are prefixed with a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; in some sort of &ldquo;box&rdquo;.  The group name will summarize the
information within it, and the expansion box will display that
information inline.  In File mode, directories and files are &ldquo;groups&rdquo;
where the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; is surrounded by brackets like this:

<pre class="example">     &lt;+&gt; include
     &lt;-&gt; src
      [+] foo.c
</pre>
   <p>In this example, we see both open and closed directories, in addition to
a file.  The directories have a box consisting of angle brackets, and a
file uses square brackets.

   <p>In all modes, a group can be &ldquo;edited&rdquo; by pressing <kbd>RET</kbd>, meaning a
file will be opened, or a directory explicitly opened in speedbar.  A
group can be expanded or contracted using <kbd>+</kbd> or
<kbd>-</kbd>.  See <a href="#Basic-Key-Bindings">Basic Key Bindings</a>.

   <p>Sometimes groups may have a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; in its indicator box.  This means
that it is a group type, but there are no contents, or no known way of
extracting contents of that group.

   <p>When a group has been expanded, the indicator button changes from
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This indicates that the contents are being shown. 
Click the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; button to contract the group, or hide the contents
currently displayed.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.1.1 Tags</h5>

<p><a name="index-tags-12"></a>
Tags are the leaf nodes of the tree system.  Tags are generally prefixed
with a simple character, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Tags can only be jumped to using
<kbd>RET</kbd> or <kbd>e</kbd>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.1.2 Boolean Flags</h5>

<p>Sometimes a group or tag is given a boolean flag.  These flags appear as
extra text characters at the end of the line.  File mode uses boolean
flags, such as a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to indicate that a file has been checked out
of a versioning system.

   <p>For additional flags, see
<!-- Note to self, update these to sub-nodes which are more relevant. -->
<a href="#File-Mode">File Mode</a>, and <a href="#Version-Control">Version Control</a>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.1.3 Unadorned Text</h5>

<p>Unadorned text generally starts in column 0, without any special symbols
prefixing them.  In Buffers mode different buffer groups are prefixed
with a description of what the following buffers are (Files, scratch
buffers, and invisible buffers.)

   <p>Unadorned text will generally be colorless, and not clickable.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.1.4 Color Cues</h5>

<p>Each type of Group, item indicator, and label is given a different
color.  The colors chosen are dependent on whether the background color
is light or dark. 
Of important note is that the &ldquo;current item&rdquo;, which may be a buffer or
file name, is highlighted red, and underlined.

   <p>Colors can be customized from the group <code>speedbar-faces</code>.  Some
modes, such as for Info, will use the Info colors instead of default
speedbar colors as an indication of what is currently being displayed.

   <p>The face naming convention mirrors the File display mode.  Modes which
do not use files will attempt to use the same colors on analogous
entries.

</div>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Mouse Bindings</h3>

<p><a name="index-mouse-bindings-13"></a>
The mouse has become a common information navigation tool.  Speedbar
will use the mouse to navigate file systems, buffer lists, and other
data.  The different textual cues provide buttons which can be clicked
on (see <a href="#Basic-Visuals">Basic Visuals</a>).  Anything that highlights can be clicked on
with the mouse, or affected by the menu.

   <p>The mouse bindings are:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Move cursor to that location. 
<br><dt><kbd>Mouse-2</kbd><dt><kbd>Double-Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Activate the current button.  <kbd>Double-Mouse-1</kbd> is called a <dfn>double
click</dfn> on other platforms, and is useful for windows users with two
button mice. 
<!-- Isn't it true that with two-button mice, the right button is Mouse-2? -->
<!-- On GNU/Linux, the right button is Mouse-3. -->
<br><dt><kbd>S-Mouse-2</kbd><dt><kbd>S-Double-Mouse-1</kbd><dd><a name="index-power-click-14"></a>This has the same effect as <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd>, except it is called a power
click.  This means that if a group with an expansion button &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; is
clicked, any caches are flushed, and subitems re-read.  If it is a name,
it will be opened in a new frame. 
<br><dt><kbd>Mouse-3</kbd><dd>Activate the speedbar menu.  The item selected affects the line clicked,
not the line where the cursor was. 
<br><dt><kbd>Mouse-1 </kbd><span class="roman">(mode line)</span><dd>Activate the menu.  This affects the item the cursor is on before the
click, since the mouse was not clicked on anything. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Buffers sub-menu.  The buffer in the attached frame is switched. 
</dl>

   <p>When the mouse moves over buttons in speedbar, details of that item
should be displayed in the minibuffer of the attached frame.  Sometimes
this can contain extra information such as file permissions, or tag
location.

<h3 class="section">2.4 Displays Submenu</h3>

<p><a name="index-displays-submenu-15"></a>
You can display different data by using different display modes.  These
specialized modes make it easier to navigate the relevant pieces of
information, such as files and directories, or buffers.

   <p>In the main menu, found by clicking <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd>, there is a submenu
labeled &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Displays</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This submenu lets you easily choose between
different display modes.

   <p>The contents are modes currently loaded into emacs.  By default, this
would include Files, Quick Buffers, and Buffers.  Other major display
modes such as Info are loaded separately.

</div>

<h2 class="chapter">3 File Mode</h2>

<p><a name="index-file-mode-16"></a>
File mode displays a summary of your current directory.  You can display
files in the attached frame, or summarize the tags found in files.  You
can even see if a file is checked out of a version control system, or
has some associated object file.

   <p>Advanced behavior, like copying and renaming files, is also provided.

</div>

<h3 class="section">3.1 Directory Display</h3>

<p><a name="index-directory-display-17"></a>
There are three major sections in the display.  The first line or two is
the root directory speedbar is currently viewing.  You can jump to one
of the parent directories by clicking on the name of the directory you
wish to jump to.

   <p>Next, directories are listed.  A directory starts with the group
indicator button &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;+&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Clicking the directory name makes speedbar
load that directory as the root directory for its display.  Clicking the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;+&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; button will list all directories and files beneath.

   <p>Next, files are listed.  Files start with the group indicator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[+]</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[?]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You can jump to a file in the attached frame by clicking
on the file name.  You can expand a file and look at its tags by
clicking on the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[+]</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol near the file name.

   <p>A typical session might look like this:

<pre class="example">     ~/lisp/
     &lt;+&gt; checkdoc
     &lt;+&gt; eieio
     &lt;-&gt; speedbar
      [+] Makefile
      [+] rpm.el #
      [+] sb-gud.el #
      [+] sb-info.el #
      [+] sb-rmail.el #
      [+] sb-w3.el
      [-] speedbar.el *!
       {+} Types
       {+} Variables
       {+} def (group)
       {+} speedbar-
      [+] speedbar.texi *
     &lt;+&gt; testme
     [+] align.el
     [+] autoconf.el
</pre>
   <p>In this example, you can see several directories.  The directory
<samp><span class="file">speedbar</span></samp> has been opened inline.  Inside the directory
<samp><span class="file">speedbar</span></samp>, the file <samp><span class="file">speedbar.el</span></samp> has its tags exposed. 
These tags are extensive, and they are summarized into tag groups.

   <p>Files get additional boolean flags associated with them.  Valid flags are:

   <p><a name="index-file-flags-18"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>*</code><dd>This file has been checked out of a version control
system.  See <a href="#Version-Control">Version Control</a>. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dobj_002dalist_007d-19"></a><br><dt><code>#</code><dd>This file has an up to date object file associated with it.  The
variable <code>speedbar-obj-alist</code> defines how speedbar determines this
value. 
<br><dt><code>!</code><dd>This file has an out of date object file associated with it. 
</dl>

   <p>A Tag group is prefixed with the symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{+}</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Clicking this
symbol will show all symbols that have been organized into that group. 
Different types of files have unique tagging methods as defined by their
major mode.  Tags are generated with either the <code>imenu</code> package, or
through the <code>etags</code> interface.

   <p>Tag groups are defined in multiple ways which make it easier to find the
tag you are looking for.  Imenu keywords explicitly create groups, and
speedbar will automatically create groups if tag lists are too long.

   <p>In our example, Imenu created the groups &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Types</span></samp>&rsquo; and

<h3 class="section">3.2 Hidden Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-hidden-files-20"></a>
On GNU and Unix systems, a hidden file is a file whose name starts
with a period.  They are hidden from a regular directory listing
because the user is not generally interested in them.

   <p>In speedbar, a hidden file is a file which isn't very interesting and
might prove distracting to the user.  Any uninteresting files are
removed from the File display.  There are two levels of uninterest in
speedbar.  The first level of uninterest are files which have no
expansion method, or way of extracting tags.  The second level is any
file that matches the same pattern used for completion in
<code>find-file</code>.  This is derived from the variable
<code>completion-ignored-extensions</code>.

   <p>You can toggle the display of uninteresting files from the toggle menu
item &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Show All Files</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This will display all level one hidden files. 
These files will be shown with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; indicator.  Level 2 hidden
files will still not be shown.

   <p>Object files fall into the category of level 2 hidden files.  You can
determine their presence by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; file indicators. 
See <a href="#Directory-Display">Directory Display</a>.

<h3 class="section">3.3 File Key Bindings</h3>

<p><a name="index-file-key-bindings-21"></a>
File mode has key bindings permitting different file system operations
such as copy or rename.  These commands all operate on the <dfn>current
file</dfn>.  In this case, the current file is the file at point, or clicked
on when pulling up the menu.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>U</kbd><dd>Move the entire speedbar display up one directory. 
<br><dt><kbd>I</kbd><dd>Display information in the minibuffer about this line.  This is the same
information shown when navigating with <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd>, or moving
the mouse over an item. 
<br><dt><kbd>B</kbd><dd>Byte compile the Emacs Lisp file on this line. 
<br><dt><kbd>L</kbd><dd>Load the Emacs Lisp file on this line.  If a <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> file exists,
optionally load that. 
<br><dt><kbd>C</kbd><dd>Copy the current file to some other location. 
<br><dt><kbd>R</kbd><dd>Rename the current file, possibly moving it to some other location. 
<br><dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd>Delete the current file. 
<br><dt><kbd>O</kbd><dd>Delete the current file's object file.  Use the symbols &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; to determine if there is an object file available. 
</dl>

   <p>One menu item toggles the display of all available files.  By default,
only files which Emacs understands, and knows how to convert into a tag
list, are shown.  By showing all files, additional files such as text files are
also displayed, but they are prefixed with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[?]</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol.  This
means that it is a file, but Emacs doesn't know how to expand it.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Buffer Mode</h2>

<p><a name="index-buffer-mode-22"></a>
Buffer mode is very similar to File mode, except that instead of
tracking the current directory and all files available there, the
current list of Emacs buffers is shown.

   <p>These buffers can have their tags expanded in the same way as files,
and uses the same unknown file indicator (see <a href="#File-Mode">File Mode</a>).

   <p>Buffer mode does not have file operation bindings, but the following
buffer specific key bindings are available:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>k</kbd><dd>Kill this buffer.  Do not touch its file. 
<br><dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd>Revert this buffer, reloading from disk. 
</dl>

   <p>In addition to Buffer mode, there is also Quick Buffer mode.  In fact,
Quick Buffers is bound to the <kbd>b</kbd> key.  The only difference between
Buffers and Quick Buffers is that after one operation  is performed
which affects the attached frame, the display is immediately reverted to
the last displayed mode.

   <p>Thus, if you are in File mode, and you need quick access to a buffer,
press <kbd>b</kbd>, click on the buffer you want, and speedbar will revert
back to File mode.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Minor Display Modes</h2>

<p><a name="index-minor-display-modes-23"></a>
For some buffers, a list of files and tags makes no sense.  This could
be because files are not currently in reference (such as web pages), or
that the files you might be interested have special properties (such as
email folders.)

   <p>In these cases, a minor display mode is needed.  A minor display mode
will override any major display mode currently being displayed for the
duration of the specialized buffer's use.  Minor display modes
will follow the general rules of their major counterparts in terms of
key bindings and visuals, but will have specialized behaviors.

<h3 class="section">5.1 RMAIL</h3>

<p><a name="index-RMAIL-24"></a>
When using RMAIL, speedbar will display two sections.  The first is a
layer one reply button.  Clicking here will initialize a reply buffer
showing only this email address in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">To:</span></samp>&rsquo; field.

   <p>The second section lists all RMAIL folders in the same directory as your
main RMAIL folder.  The general rule is that RMAIL folders always appear
in all caps, or numbers.  It is possible to save mail in folders with
lower case letters, but there is no clean way of detecting such RMAIL folders
without opening them all.

   <p>Each folder can be visited by clicking the name.  You can move mail from
the current RMAIL folder into a different folder by clicking the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;M&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; button.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo; stands for Move.

   <p>In this way you can manage your existing RMAIL folders fairly easily
using the mouse.

When browsing Info files, all local relevant information is displayed in

All top-level info nodes are shown in the speedbar frame, and can be
jumped to by clicking the name.

   <p>You can open these nodes with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[+]</span></samp>&rsquo; button to see what sub-topics
are available.  Since these sub-topics are not examined until you click
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[+]</span></samp>&rsquo; button, sometimes a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[?]</span></samp>&rsquo; will appear when you click on
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[+]</span></samp>&rsquo;, indicating that there are no sub-topics.

   <p>If you are using graphical mode you can see how selected variables
change each time your program stops (see <a href="emacs.html#Watch-Expressions">Watch Expressions</a>).

   <p>If you are using text command mode, speedbar can show
you the current stack when the current buffer is the <samp><span class="file">*gdb*</span></samp>
buffer.  Usually, it will just report that there is no stack, but when
the application is stopped, the current stack will be shown.

   <p>You can click on any stack element and gdb will move to that stack
level.  You can then check variables local to that level at the GDB
prompt.

<p><a name="index-customizing-28"></a>
Speedbar is highly customizable, with a plethora of control elements. 
Since speedbar is so visual and reduces so much information, this is an
important aspect of its behavior.

   <p>In general, there are three custom groups you can use to quickly modify
speedbar's behavior.

     <dl>
<dt><code>speedbar</code><dd>Basic speedbar behaviors.

<h3 class="section">6.1 Frames and Faces</h3>

<p><a name="index-faces-29"></a><a name="index-frame-parameters-30"></a>
There are several faces speedbar generates to provide a consistent
color scheme across display types.  You can customize these faces using
your favorite method.  They are:

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dbutton_002dface_007d-31"></a>
<dl><dt>speedbar-button-face<dd>Face used on expand/contract buttons. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dfile_002dface_007d-32"></a><br><dt>speedbar-file-face<dd>Face used on Files.  Should also be used on non-directory like nodes. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002ddirectory_002dface_007d-33"></a><br><dt>speedbar-directory-face<dd>Face used for directories, or nodes which consist of groups of other nodes. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dtag_002dface_007d-34"></a><br><dt>speedbar-tag-face<dd>Face used for tags in a file, or for leaf items. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dselected_002dface_007d-35"></a><br><dt>speedbar-selected-face<dd>Face used to highlight the selected item.  This would be the current

<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dhighlight_002dface_007d-36"></a><br><dt>speedbar-highlight-face<dd>Face used when the mouse passes over a button. 
</dl>

   <p>You can also customize speedbar's initial frame parameters.  How this is
accomplished is dependent on your platform being Emacs or XEmacs.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dframe_002dparameters_007d_002c-Emacs-37"></a>In Emacs, change the alist <code>speedbar-frame-parameters</code>.  This
variable is used to set up initial details.  Height is also
automatically added when speedbar is created, though you can override
it.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dframe_002dplist_007d_002c-XEmacs-38"></a>In XEmacs, change the plist <code>speedbar-frame-plist</code>.  This is the
XEmacs way of doing the same thing.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Tag Hierarchy Methods</h3>

<p><a name="index-tag-hierarchy-39"></a><a name="index-tag-groups-40"></a><a name="index-tag-sorting-41"></a>
When listing tags within a file, it is possible to get an annoyingly
long list of entries.  Imenu (which generates the tag list in Emacs)
will group some classes of items automatically.   Even here, however,
some tag groups can be quite large.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dtag_002dhierarchy_002dmethod_007d-42"></a>To solve this problem, tags can be grouped into logical units through a
hierarchy processor.  The specific variable to use is
<code>speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method</code>.  There are several methods that
can be applied in any order.  They are:

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dtrim_002dwords_002dtag_002dhierarchy_007d-43"></a>
<dl><dt><code>speedbar-trim-words-tag-hierarchy</code><dd>Find a common prefix for all elements of a group, and trim it off. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dprefix_002dgroup_002dtag_002dhierarchy_007d-44"></a><br><dt><code>speedbar-prefix-group-tag-hierarchy</code><dd>If a group is too large, place sets of tags into bins based on common
prefixes. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dsimple_002dgroup_002dtag_002dhierarchy_007d-45"></a><br><dt><code>speedbar-simple-group-tag-hierarchy</code><dd>Take all items in the top level list not in a group, and stick them into
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Tags</span></samp>&rsquo; group. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dsort_002dtag_002dhierarchy_007d-46"></a><br><dt><code>speedbar-sort-tag-hierarchy</code><dd>Sort all items, leaving groups on top. 
</dl>

   <p>You can also add your own functions to reorganize tags as you see fit.

   <p>Some other control variables are:

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dtag_002dgroup_002dname_002dminimum_002dlength_007d-47"></a>
<dl><dt><code>speedbar-tag-group-name-minimum-length</code><dd>Default value: 4.

     <p>The minimum length of a prefix group name before expanding.  Thus, if
the <code>speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method</code> includes
<code>speedbar-prefix-group-tag-hierarchy</code> and one such group's common
characters is less than this number of characters, then the group name
will be changed to the form of:

     <pre class="example">          worda to wordb
</pre>
     <p>instead of just

     <pre class="example">          word
</pre>
     <p>This way we won't get silly looking listings.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dtag_002dsplit_002dminimum_002dlength_007d-48"></a><br><dt><code>speedbar-tag-split-minimum-length</code><dd>Default value: 20.

     <p>Minimum length before we stop trying to create sub-lists in tags. 
This is used by all tag-hierarchy methods that break large lists into
sub-lists.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dtag_002dregroup_002dmaximum_002dlength_007d-49"></a><br><dt><code>speedbar-tag-regroup-maximum-length</code><dd>Default value: 10.

     <p>Maximum length of submenus that are regrouped. 
If the regrouping option is used, then if two or more short subgroups
are next to each other, then they are combined until this number of
items is reached.

<h3 class="section">6.3 Version Control</h3>

<p><a name="index-version-control-50"></a><a name="index-vc-extensions-51"></a>
When using the file mode in speedbar, information regarding a version
control system adds small details to the display.  If a file is in a
version control system, and is &ldquo;checked out&rdquo; or &ldquo;locked&rdquo; locally, an
asterisk &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; appears at the end of the file name.  In addition,
the directory name for Version Control systems are left out of the
speedbar display.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002ddirectory_002dunshown_002dregexp_007d-52"></a>You can easily add new version control systems into speedbar's detection
scheme.  To make a directory &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; from the list, use the variable
<code>speedbar-directory-unshown-regexp</code>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dvc_002dpath_002denable_002dhook_007d-53"></a>Next, you need to write entries for two hooks.  The first is
<code>speedbar-vc-path-enable-hook</code> which will enable a VC check in the
current directory for the group of files being checked.  Your hook
function should take one parameter (the directory to check) and return
<code>t</code> if your VC method is in control here.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dvc_002din_002dcontrol_002dhook_007d-54"></a>The second function is <code>speedbar-vc-in-control-hook</code>.  This hook
takes two parameters, the <var>path</var> of the file to check, and the
<var>file</var> name.  Return <code>t</code> if you want to have the asterisk
placed near this file.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dvc_002dindicator_007d-55"></a>Lastly, you can change the VC indicator using the variable
<code>speedbar-vc-indicator</code>, and specify a single character string.

<h3 class="section">6.4 Hooks</h3>

<p><a name="index-hooks-56"></a>
There are several hooks in speedbar allowing custom behaviors to be

<h2 class="chapter">7 Extending</h2>

<p><a name="index-extending-66"></a>
Speedbar can run different types of Major display modes such as Files
(see <a href="#File-Mode">File Mode</a>), and Buffers (see <a href="#Buffer-Mode">Buffer Mode</a>).  It can also manage
different minor display modes for use with buffers handling specialized
data.

   <p>These major and minor display modes are handled through an extension
system which permits specialized keymaps and menu extensions, in
addition to a unique rendering function.  You can also specify a wide
range of tagging functions.  The default uses <code>imenu</code>, but new
tagging methods can be easily added.  In this chapter, you will
learn how to write your own major or minor display modes, and how to
create specialized tagging functions.

<h3 class="section">7.1 Minor Display Modes</h3>

<p><a name="index-create-minor-display-mode-67"></a>
A <dfn>minor display mode</dfn> is a mode useful when using a specific type of
buffer.  This mode might not be useful for any other kind of data or
mode, or may just be more useful that a files or buffers based mode when
working with a specialized mode.

   <p>Examples that already exist for speedbar include RMAIL, Info, and gdb. 
These modes display information specific to the major mode shown in the
attached frame.

   <p>To enable a minor display mode in your favorite Major mode, follow these
steps.  The string &lsquo;<samp><var>name</var></samp>&rsquo; is the name of the major mode being
augmented with speedbar.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Create the keymap variable <var>name</var><code>-speedbar-key-map</code>.

     <li>Create a function, named whatever you like, which assigns values into your
keymap.  Use this command to create the keymap before assigning
bindings:

     <pre class="smallexample">              (setq <var>name</var>-speedbar-key-map (speedbar-make-specialized-keymap))
</pre>
     <p>This function creates a special keymap for use in speedbar.

     <li>Call your install function, or assign it to a hook like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (if (featurep 'speedbar)
              (<var>name</var>-install-speedbar-variables)
            (add-hook 'speedbar-load-hook '<var>name</var>-install-speedbar-variables))
</pre>
     <li>Create an easymenu compatible vector named
<var>name</var><code>-speedbar-menu-items</code>.  This will be spliced into
speedbar's control menu.

     <li>Create a function called <var>name</var><code>-speedbar-buttons</code>.  This function
should take one variable, which is the buffer for which it will create
buttons.   At this time <code>(current-buffer)</code> will point to the
uncleared speedbar buffer.
        </ol>

   <p>When writing <var>name</var><code>-speedbar-buttons</code>, the first thing you will
want to do is execute a check to see if you need to re-create your
display.  If it needs to be cleared, you need to erase the speedbar
buffer yourself, and start drawing buttons.  See <a href="#Creating-a-display">Creating a display</a>.

<h3 class="section">7.2 Major Display Modes</h3>

<p><a name="index-create-major-display-mode-68"></a>
Creating a <dfn>Major Display Mode</dfn> for speedbar requires authoring a keymap,
an easy-menu segment, and writing several functions.  These items can be
given any name, and are made the same way as in a minor display mode
(see <a href="#Minor-Display-Modes">Minor Display Modes</a>).  Once this is done, these items need to be
registered.

   <p>Because this setup activity may or may not have speedbar available when
it is being loaded, it is necessary to create an install function.  This
function should create and initialize the keymap, and add your
expansions into the customization tables.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dmake_002dspecialized_002dkeymap_007d-69"></a>When creating the keymap, use the function
<code>speedbar-make-specialized-keymap</code> instead of other keymap making
functions.  This will provide you with the initial bindings needed. 
Some common speedbar functions you might want to bind are:

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dedit_002dline_007d-70"></a>
<dl><dt><code>speedbar-edit-line</code><dd>Edit the item on the current line. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dexpand_002dline_007d-71"></a><br><dt><code>speedbar-expand-line</code><dd>Expand the item under the cursor. 
With a numeric argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>), flush cached data before expanding. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dcontract_002dline_007d-72"></a><br><dt><code>speedbar-contract-line</code><dd>Contract the item under the cursor. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dline_002dpath_007d-73"></a>These function require that function <code>speedbar-line-path</code> be
correctly overloaded to work.

   <p>Next, register your extension like this;

<pre class="example">       (speedbar-add-expansion-list '("MyExtension"
                                      MyExtension-speedbar-menu-items
                                      MyExtension-speedbar-key-map
                                      MyExtension-speedbar-buttons))
</pre>
   <p>There are no limitations to the names you use.

   <p>The first parameter is the string representing your display mode. 
The second parameter is a variable name containing an easymenu compatible
menu definition.  This will be stuck in the middle of speedbar's menu. 
The third parameter is the variable name containing the keymap we
discussed earlier. 
The last parameter is a function which draws buttons for your mode. 
This function must take two parameters.  The directory currently being
displayed, and the depth at which you should start rendering buttons. 
The function will then draw (starting at the current cursor position)
any buttons deemed necessary based on the input parameters. 
See <a href="#Creating-a-display">Creating a display</a>.

   <p>Next, you need to register function overrides.  This may look something
like this:

<pre class="example">     (speedbar-add-mode-functions-list
      '("MYEXTENSION"
        (speedbar-item-info . MyExtension-speedbar-item-info)
        (speedbar-line-path . MyExtension-speedbar-line-path)))
</pre>
   <p>The first element in the list is the name of you extension.  The second
is an alist of functions to overload.  The function to overload is
first, followed by what you want called instead.

   <p>For <code>speedbar-line-path</code> your function should take an optional DEPTH
parameter.  This is the starting depth for heavily indented lines.  If
it is not provided, you can derive it like this:

<pre class="example">     (save-match-data
       (if (not depth)
           (progn
             (beginning-of-line)
             (looking-at "^\\([0-9]+\\):")
             (setq depth (string-to-int (match-string 1)))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where the depth is stored as invisible text at the beginning of each
line.

   <p>The path returned should be the full path name of the file associated
with that line.  If the cursor is on a tag, then the file containing
that tag should be returned.  This is critical for built in file based
functions to work (meaning less code for you to write).  If your display
does not deal in files, you do not need to overload this function.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002ditem_002dinfo_007d-74"></a>The function <code>speedbar-item-info</code>, however, is very likely to need
overloading.  This function takes no parameters and must derive a text
summary to display in the minibuffer.

   <p>There are several helper functions you can use if you are going to use
built in tagging.  These functions can be <code>or</code>ed since each one
returns non-<code>nil</code> if it displays a message.  They are:

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002ditem_002dinfo_002dfile_002dhelper_007d-75"></a>
<dl><dt><code>speedbar-item-info-file-helper</code><dd>This takes an optional <var>filename</var> parameter.  You can derive your own
filename, or it will derive it using a (possibly overloaded) function
<code>speedbar-line-file</code>.  It shows details about a file. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002ditem_002dinfo_002dtag_002dhelper_007d-76"></a><br><dt><code>speedbar-item-info-tag-helper</code><dd>If the current line is a tag, then display information about that tag,
such as its parent file, and location. 
</dl>

   <p>Your custom function might look like this:

<pre class="example">     (defun MyExtension-item-info ()
       "Display information about the current line."
       (or (speedbar-item-info-tag-helper)
           (message "Interesting detail.")))
</pre>
   <p>Once you have done all this, speedbar will show an entry in the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Displays</span></samp>&rsquo; menu declaring that your extension is available.

</div>

<h3 class="section">7.3 Tagging Extensions</h3>

<p>It is possible to create new methods for tagging files in speedbar. 
To do this, you need two basic functions, one function to fetch the
tags from a buffer, the other to insert them below the filename.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>my-fetch-dynamic-tags</b><var> file<a name="index-my_002dfetch_002ddynamic_002dtags-77"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Parse <var>file</var> for a list of tags.  Return the list, or <code>t</code> if there was
an error. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The non-error return value can be anything, as long as it can be
inserted by its paired function:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>my-insert-tag-list</b><var> level lst<a name="index-my_002dinsert_002dtag_002dlist-78"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Insert a list of tags <var>lst</var> started at indentation level
<var>level</var>.  Creates buttons for each tag, and provides any other
display information required. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002dcreate_002dtag_002dhierarchy_007d-79"></a>It is often useful to use <code>speedbar-create-tag-hierarchy</code> on your
token list.  See that function's documentation for details on what it
requires.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspeedbar_002ddynamic_002dtags_002dfunction_002dlist_007d-80"></a>Once these two functions are written, modify the variable
<code>speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list</code> to include your parser at the
beginning, like this:

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list
                  '(my-fetch-dynamic-tags . my-insert-tag-list))
</pre>
   <p>If your parser is only good for a few types of files, make sure that it
is either a buffer local modification, or that the tag generator returns
<code>t</code> for non valid buffers.

<h3 class="section">7.4 Creating a display</h3>

<p><a name="index-creating-a-display-81"></a>
Rendering a display in speedbar is completely flexible.  When your
button function is called, see <a href="#Minor-Display-Modes">Minor Display Modes</a>, and <a href="#Major-Display-Modes">Major Display Modes</a>, you have control to <code>insert</code> anything you want.

   <p>The conventions allow almost anything to be inserted, but several helper
functions are provided to make it easy to create the standardized
buttons.

   <p>To understand the built in functions, each &ldquo;button&rdquo; in speedbar consists
of four important pieces of data.  The text to be displayed, token
data to be associated with the text, a function to call, and some face to
display it in.

   <p>When a function is provided, then that text becomes mouse activated,
meaning the mouse will highlight the text.

   <p>Additionally, for data which can form deep trees, each line is given a
depth which indicates how far down the tree it is.  This information is
stored in invisible text at the beginning of each line, and is used by
the navigation commands.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>speedbar-insert-button</b><var> text face mouse function &amp;optional token prevline<a name="index-speedbar_002dinsert_002dbutton-82"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function inserts one button into the current location. 
<var>text</var> is the text to insert.  <var>face</var> is the face in which it
will be displayed.   <var>mouse</var> is the face to display over the text
when the mouse passes over it.  <var>function</var> is called whenever the
user clicks on the text.

        <p>The optional argument <var>token</var> is extra data to associated with the
text.  Lastly <var>prevline</var> should be non-<code>nil</code> if you want this line to
appear directly after the last button which was created instead of on
the next line. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>speedbar-make-tag-line</b><var> exp-button-type exp-button-char exp-button-function exp-button-data tag-button tag-button-function tag-button-data tag-button-face depth<a name="index-speedbar_002dmake_002dtag_002dline-83"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>Create a tag line with <var>exp-button-type</var> for the small expansion
button.  This is the button that expands or contracts a node (if
applicable), and <var>exp-button-char</var> the character in it (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc.).  <var>exp-button-function</var> is the function
to call if it's clicked on.  Button types are <code>bracket</code>,
<code>angle</code>, <code>curly</code>, <code>expandtag</code>, <code>statictag</code>, and
<code>nil</code>.  <var>exp-button-data</var> is extra data attached to the text
forming the expansion button.

        <p>Next, <var>tag-button</var> is the text of the tag. 
<var>tag-button-function</var> is the function to call if clicked on, and
<var>tag-button-data</var> is the data to attach to the text field (such a
tag positioning, etc.).  <var>tag-button-face</var> is a face used for this
type of tag.

        <p>Lastly, <var>depth</var> shows the depth of expansion.

        <p>This function assumes that the cursor is in the speedbar window at the
position to insert a new item, and that the new item will end with a CR. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>speedbar-insert-generic-list</b><var> level list expand-fun find-fun<a name="index-speedbar_002dinsert_002dgeneric_002dlist-84"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>At <var>level</var>, (the current indentation level desired) insert a generic
multi-level alist <var>list</var>.  Associations with lists get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{+}</span></samp>&rsquo;
tags (to expand into more nodes) and those with positions or other data
just get a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; as the indicator.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{+}</span></samp>&rsquo; buttons will have the
function <var>expand-fun</var> and the token is the <code>cdr</code> list.  The
token name will have the function <var>find-fun</var> and not token.

        <p>Each element of the list can have one of these forms:

          <dl>
<dt><code>(</code><var>name</var><code> . marker-or-number)</code><dd>One tag at this level. 
<br><dt><code>(</code><var>name</var><code> (</code><var>name</var><code> . marker-or-number) (</code><var>name</var><code> . marker-or-number) ... )</code><dd>One group of tags. 
<br><dt><code>(</code><var>name</var><code> marker-or-number (</code><var>name</var><code> . marker-or-number) ... )</code><dd>One Group of tags where the group has a starting position. 
</dl>

        <p>When you use <code>speedbar-insert-generic-list</code>, there are some
variables you can set buffer-locally to change the behavior.  The most
obvious is <code>speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method</code>. 
See <a href="#Tag-Hierarchy-Methods">Tag Hierarchy Methods</a>.

     <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>speedbar-generic-list-group-expand-button-type</b><var><a name="index-speedbar_002dgeneric_002dlist_002dgroup_002dexpand_002dbutton_002dtype-85"></a></var><br>
<blockquote> <p>This is the button type used for groups of tags, whether expanded
or added in via a hierarchy method.  Two good values are

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
