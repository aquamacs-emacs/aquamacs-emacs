  <h3 class="section">16.3 Assignments in Embedded Mode</h3>

  <p>The &lsquo;<samp>:=</samp>&rsquo; (assignment) and
  &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; (&ldquo;evaluates-to&rdquo;)
  operators are especially useful in Embedded mode. They allow you
  to make a definition in one formula, then refer to that
  definition in other formulas embedded in the same buffer.</p>

  <p>An embedded formula which is an assignment to a variable, as
  in</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
foo := 5
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>records &lsquo;<samp>5</samp>&rsquo; as the stored value of
  <code>foo</code> for the purposes of Embedded mode operations in
  the current buffer. It does <em>not</em> actually store
  &lsquo;<samp>5</samp>&rsquo; as the &ldquo;global&rdquo; value of
  <code>foo</code>, however. Regular Calc operations, and Embedded
  formulas in other buffers, will not see this assignment.</p>

  <p>One way to use this assigned value is simply to create an
  Embedded formula elsewhere that refers to <code>foo</code>, and
  to press <kbd>=</kbd> in that formula. However, this permanently
  replaces the <code>foo</code> in the formula with its current
  value. More interesting is to use
  &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; elsewhere:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
foo + 7 =&gt; 12
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>See <a href=
  "Evaluates_002dTo-Operator.html#Evaluates_002dTo-Operator">Evaluates-To
  Operator</a>, for a general discussion of
  &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If you move back and change the assignment to
  <code>foo</code>, any &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; formulas
  which refer to it are automatically updated.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
foo := 17

foo + 7 =&gt; 24
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The obvious question then is, <em>how</em> can one easily
  change the assignment to <code>foo</code>? If you simply select
  the formula in Embedded mode and type 17, the assignment itself
  will be replaced by the 17. The effect on the other formula will
  be that the variable <code>foo</code> becomes unassigned:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
17

foo + 7 =&gt; foo + 7
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The right thing to do is first to use a selection command
  (<kbd>j 2</kbd> will do the trick) to select the righthand side
  of the assignment. Then, <kbd>17 <span class="key">TAB</span>
  <span class="key">DEL</span></kbd> will swap the 17 into place
  (see <a href=
  "Selecting-Subformulas.html#Selecting-Subformulas">Selecting
  Subformulas</a>, to see how this works).</p><a name=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-j" id="index-C_002dx-_002a-j"></a> <a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dselect" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dselect"></a>

  <p>The <kbd>C-x * j</kbd> (<code>calc-embedded-select</code>)
  command provides an easy way to operate on assignments. It is
  just like <kbd>C-x * e</kbd>, except that if the enabled formula
  is an assignment, it uses <kbd>j 2</kbd> to select the righthand
  side. If the enabled formula is an evaluates-to, it uses <kbd>j
  1</kbd> to select the lefthand side. A formula can also be a
  combination of both:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
bar := foo + 3 =&gt; 20
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>in which case <kbd>C-x * j</kbd> will select the middle part
  (&lsquo;<samp>foo + 3</samp>&rsquo;).</p>

  <p>The formula is automatically deselected when you leave
  Embedded mode.</p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-u" id=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-u"></a> <a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dupdate_002dformula" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dupdate_002dformula"></a>

  <p>Another way to change the assignment to <code>foo</code> would
  simply be to edit the number using regular Emacs editing rather
  than Embedded mode. Then, we have to find a way to get Embedded
  mode to notice the change. The <kbd>C-x * u</kbd>
  (<code>calc-embedded-update-formula</code>) command is a
  convenient way to do this.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
foo := 6

foo + 7 =&gt; 13
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Pressing <kbd>C-x * u</kbd> is much like pressing <kbd>C-x * e
  = C-x * e</kbd>, that is, temporarily enabling Embedded mode for
  the formula under the cursor and then evaluating it with
  <kbd>=</kbd>. But <kbd>C-x * u</kbd> does not actually use
  <kbd>C-x * e</kbd>, and in fact another formula somewhere else
  can be enabled in Embedded mode while you use <kbd>C-x * u</kbd>
  and that formula will not be disturbed.</p>

  <p>With a numeric prefix argument, <kbd>C-x * u</kbd> updates all
  active &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; formulas in the buffer.
  Formulas which have not yet been activated in Embedded mode, and
  formulas which do not have &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; as
  their top-level operator, are not affected by this. (This is
  useful only if you have used <kbd>m C</kbd>; see below.)</p>

  <p>With a plain <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix, <kbd>C-u C-x * u</kbd>
  updates only in the region between mark and point rather than in
  the whole buffer.</p>

  <p><kbd>C-x * u</kbd> is also a handy way to activate a formula,
  such as an &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; formula that has
  freshly been typed in or loaded from a file.</p><a name=
  "index-C_002dx-_002a-a" id="index-C_002dx-_002a-a"></a> <a name=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dactivate" id=
  "index-calc_002dembedded_002dactivate"></a>

  <p>The <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> (<code>calc-embedded-activate</code>)
  command scans through the current buffer and activates all
  embedded formulas that contain &lsquo;<samp>:=</samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; symbols. This does not mean that
  Embedded mode is actually turned on, but only that the
  formulas&rsquo; positions are registered with Embedded mode so
  that the &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; values can be properly
  updated as assignments are changed.</p>

  <p>It is a good idea to type <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> right after
  loading a file that uses embedded
  &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; operators. Emacs includes a
  nifty &ldquo;buffer-local variables&rdquo; feature that you can
  use to do this automatically. The idea is to place near the end
  of your file a few lines that look like this:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
--- Local Variables: ---
--- eval:(calc-embedded-activate) ---
--- End: ---
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>where the leading and trailing &lsquo;<samp>---</samp>&rsquo;
  can be replaced by any suitable strings (which must be the same
  on all three lines) or omitted altogether; in a TeX or LaTeX
  file, &lsquo;<samp>%</samp>&rsquo; would be a good leading string
  and no trailing string would be necessary. In a C program,
  &lsquo;<samp>/*</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>*/</samp>&rsquo;
  would be good leading and trailing strings.</p>

  <p>When Emacs loads a file into memory, it checks for a Local
  Variables section like this one at the end of the file. If it
  finds this section, it does the specified things (in this case,
  running <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> automatically) before editing of the
  file begins. The Local Variables section must be within 3000
  characters of the end of the file for Emacs to find it, and it
  must be in the last page of the file if the file has any page
  separators. See <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">
  Local Variables in Files</a> in <cite>the Emacs
  manual</cite>.</p>

  <p>Note that <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> does not update the formulas it
  finds. To do this, type, say, <kbd>M-1 C-x * u</kbd> after
  <kbd><span class="nolinebreak">C-x</span>&nbsp;*&nbsp;a</kbd> 
  <!-- /@w -->. Generally this should not be a problem, though,
  because the formulas will have been up-to-date already when the
  file was saved.</p>

  <p>Normally, <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> activates all the formulas it
  finds, but any previous active formulas remain active as well.
  With a positive numeric prefix argument, <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> first
  deactivates all current active formulas, then actives the ones it
  finds in its scan of the buffer. With a negative prefix argument,
  <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> simply deactivates all formulas.</p>

  <p>Embedded mode has two symbols,
  &lsquo;<samp>Active</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>~Active</samp>&rsquo;, which it puts next to the
  major mode name in a buffer&rsquo;s mode line. It puts
  &lsquo;<samp>Active</samp>&rsquo; if it has reason to believe
  that all formulas in the buffer are active, because you have
  typed <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> and Calc has not since had to deactivate
  any formulas (which can happen if Calc goes to update an
  &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; formula somewhere because a
  variable changed, and finds that the formula is no longer there
  due to some kind of editing outside of Embedded mode). Calc puts
  &lsquo;<samp>~Active</samp>&rsquo; in the mode line if some, but
  probably not all, formulas in the buffer are active. This happens
  if you activate a few formulas one at a time but never use
  <kbd>C-x * a</kbd>, or if you used <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> but then
  Calc had to deactivate a formula because it lost track of it. If
  neither of these symbols appears in the mode line, no embedded
  formulas are active in the buffer (e.g., before Embedded mode has
  been used, or after a <kbd>M-- C-x * a</kbd>).</p>

  <p>Embedded formulas can refer to assignments both before and
  after them in the buffer. If there are several assignments to a
  variable, the nearest preceding assignment is used if there is
  one, otherwise the following assignment is used.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
x =&gt; 1

x := 1

x =&gt; 1

x := 2

x =&gt; 2
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>As well as simple variables, you can also assign to subscript
  expressions of the form
  &lsquo;<samp><var>var</var>_<var>number</var></samp>&rsquo; (as
  in <code>x_0</code>), or
  &lsquo;<samp><var>var</var>_<var>var</var></samp>&rsquo; (as in
  <code>x_max</code>). Assignments to other kinds of objects can be
  represented by Calc, but the automatic linkage between
  assignments and references works only for plain variables and
  these two kinds of subscript expressions.</p>

  <p>If there are no assignments to a given variable, the global
  stored value for the variable is used (see <a href=
  "Storing-Variables.html#Storing-Variables">Storing
  Variables</a>), or, if no value is stored, the variable is left
  in symbolic form. Note that global stored values will be lost
  when the file is saved and loaded in a later Emacs session,
  unless you have used the <kbd>s p</kbd>
  (<code>calc-permanent-variable</code>) command to save them; see
  <a href=
  "Operations-on-Variables.html#Operations-on-Variables">Operations
  on Variables</a>.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>m C</kbd> (<code>calc-auto-recompute</code>) command
  turns automatic recomputation of &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo;
  forms on and off. If you turn automatic recomputation off, you
  will have to use <kbd>C-x * u</kbd> to update these formulas
  manually after an assignment has been changed. If you plan to
  change several assignments at once, it may be more efficient to
  type <kbd>m C</kbd>, change all the assignments, then use
  <kbd>M-1 C-x * u</kbd> to update the entire buffer afterwards.
  The <kbd>m C</kbd> command also controls
  &lsquo;<samp>=&gt;</samp>&rsquo; formulas on the stack; see
  <a href=
  "Evaluates_002dTo-Operator.html#Evaluates_002dTo-Operator">Evaluates-To
  Operator</a>. When you turn automatic recomputation back on, the
  stack will be updated but the Embedded buffer will not; you must
  use <kbd>C-x * u</kbd> to update the buffer by hand.</p>
