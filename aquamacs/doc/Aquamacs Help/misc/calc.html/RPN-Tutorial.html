  <h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 RPN Calculations and the
  Stack</h4><a name="index-RPN-notation" id=
  "index-RPN-notation"></a>

  <p>Calc normally uses RPN notation. You may be familiar with the
  RPN system from Hewlett-Packard calculators, FORTH, or
  PostScript. (Reverse Polish Notation, RPN, is named after the
  Polish mathematician Jan Lukasiewicz.)</p>

  <p>The central component of an RPN calculator is the
  <em>stack</em>. A calculator stack is like a stack of dishes. New
  dishes (numbers) are added at the top of the stack, and numbers
  are normally only removed from the top of the stack.</p><a name=
  "index-Operators" id="index-Operators"></a> <a name=
  "index-Operands" id="index-Operands"></a>

  <p>In an operation like &lsquo;<samp>2+3</samp>&rsquo;, the 2 and
  3 are called the <em>operands</em> and the
  &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; is the <em>operator</em>. In an RPN
  calculator you always enter the operands first, then the
  operator. Each time you type a number, Calc adds or
  <em>pushes</em> it onto the top of the Stack. When you press an
  operator key like <kbd>+</kbd>, Calc <em>pops</em> the
  appropriate number of operands from the stack and pushes back the
  result.</p>

  <p>Thus we could add the numbers 2 and 3 in an RPN calculator by
  typing: <kbd>2 <span class="key">RET</span> 3 <span class=
  "key">RET</span> +</kbd>. (The <tt class="key">RET</tt> key,
  Return, corresponds to the <tt class="key">ENTER</tt> key on
  traditional RPN calculators.) Try this now if you wish; type
  <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> to switch into the Calc window (you can type
  <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> again or <kbd>C-x * o</kbd> to switch back to
  the Tutorial window). The first four keystrokes
  &ldquo;push&rdquo; the numbers 2 and 3 onto the stack. The
  <kbd>+</kbd> key &ldquo;pops&rdquo; the top two numbers from the
  stack, adds them, and pushes the result (5) back onto the stack.
  Here&rsquo;s how the stack will look at various points throughout
  the calculation:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
    .          1:  2          2:  2          1:  5              .
                   .          1:  3              .
                                  .

  C-x * c          2 <span class=
"key">RET</span>          3 <span class=
"key">RET</span>            +             <span class=
"key">DEL</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The &lsquo;<samp>.</samp>&rsquo; symbol is a marker that
  represents the top of the stack. Note that the &ldquo;top&rdquo;
  of the stack is really shown at the bottom of the Stack window.
  This may seem backwards, but it turns out to be less distracting
  in regular use.</p><a name="index-Stack-levels" id=
  "index-Stack-levels"></a> <a name="index-Levels-of-stack" id=
  "index-Levels-of-stack"></a>

  <p>The numbers &lsquo;<samp>1:</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>2:</samp>&rsquo; on the left are <em>stack level
  numbers</em>. Old RPN calculators always had four stack levels
  called &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>y</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;. Calc&rsquo;s stack can grow as
  large as you like, so it uses numbers instead of letters. Some
  stack-manipulation commands accept a numeric argument that says
  which stack level to work on. Normal commands like <kbd>+</kbd>
  always work on the top few levels of the stack.</p>

  <p>The Stack buffer is just an Emacs buffer, and you can move
  around in it using the regular Emacs motion commands. But no
  matter where the cursor is, even if you have scrolled the
  &lsquo;<samp>.</samp>&rsquo; marker out of view, most Calc
  commands always move the cursor back down to level 1 before doing
  anything. It is possible to move the &lsquo;<samp>.</samp>&rsquo;
  marker upwards through the stack, temporarily
  &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; some numbers from commands like
  <kbd>+</kbd>. This is called <em>stack truncation</em> and we
  will not cover it in this tutorial; see <a href=
  "Truncating-the-Stack.html#Truncating-the-Stack">Truncating the
  Stack</a>, if you are interested.</p>

  <p>You don&rsquo;t really need the second <tt class=
  "key">RET</tt> in <kbd>2 <span class="key">RET</span> 3
  <span class="key">RET</span> +</kbd>. That&rsquo;s because if you
  type any operator name or other non-numeric key when you are
  entering a number, the Calculator automatically enters that
  number and then does the requested command. Thus <kbd>2
  <span class="key">RET</span> 3 +</kbd> will work just as
  well.</p>

  <p>Examples in this tutorial will often omit <tt class=
  "key">RET</tt> even when the stack displays shown would only
  happen if you did press <tt class="key">RET</tt>:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  2          2:  2          1:  5
    .          1:  3              .
                   .

  2 <span class="key">RET</span>            3              +
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here, after pressing <kbd>3</kbd> the stack would really show
  &lsquo;<samp>1: 2</samp>&rsquo; with &lsquo;<samp>Calc:
  3</samp>&rsquo; in the minibuffer. In these situations, you can
  press the optional <tt class="key">RET</tt> to see the stack as
  the figure shows.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong> (This tutorial will
  include exercises at various points. Try them if you wish.
  Answers to all the exercises are located at the end of the
  Tutorial chapter. Each exercise will include a cross-reference to
  its particular answer. If you are reading with the Emacs Info
  system, press <kbd>f</kbd> and the exercise number to go to the
  answer, then the letter <kbd>l</kbd> to return to where you
  were.)</p>

  <p>Here&rsquo;s the first exercise: What will the keystrokes
  <kbd>1 <span class="key">RET</span> 2 <span class=
  "key">RET</span> 3 <span class="key">RET</span> 4 + * -</kbd>
  compute? (&lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; is the symbol for
  multiplication.) Figure it out by hand, then try it with Calc to
  see if you&rsquo;re right. See <a href=
  "RPN-Answer-1.html#RPN-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Compute &lsquo;<samp>2*4
  + 7*9.5 + 5/4</samp>&rsquo; using the stack. See <a href=
  "RPN-Answer-2.html#RPN-Answer-2">2</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>The <tt class="key">DEL</tt> key is called Backspace on some
  keyboards. It is whatever key you would use to correct a simple
  typing error when regularly using Emacs. The <tt class=
  "key">DEL</tt> key pops and throws away the top value on the
  stack. (You can still get that value back from the Trail if you
  should need it later on.) There are many places in this tutorial
  where we assume you have used <tt class="key">DEL</tt> to erase
  the results of the previous example at the beginning of a new
  example. In the few places where it is really important to use
  <tt class="key">DEL</tt> to clear away old results, the text will
  remind you to do so.</p>

  <p>(It won&rsquo;t hurt to let things accumulate on the stack,
  except that whenever you give a display-mode-changing command
  Calc will have to spend a long time reformatting such a large
  stack.)</p>

  <p>Since the <kbd>-</kbd> key is also an operator (it subtracts
  the top two stack elements), how does one enter a negative
  number? Calc uses the <kbd>_</kbd> (underscore) key to act like
  the minus sign in a number. So, typing <kbd>-5 <span class=
  "key">RET</span></kbd> won&rsquo;t work because the <kbd>-</kbd>
  key will try to do a subtraction, but <kbd>_5 <span class=
  "key">RET</span></kbd> works just fine.</p>

  <p>You can also press <kbd>n</kbd>, which means &ldquo;change
  sign.&rdquo; It changes the number at the top of the stack (or
  the number being entered) from positive to negative or
  vice-versa: <kbd>5 n <span class=
  "key">RET</span></kbd>.</p><a name=
  "index-Duplicating-a-stack-entry" id=
  "index-Duplicating-a-stack-entry"></a>

  <p>If you press <tt class="key">RET</tt> when you&rsquo;re not
  entering a number, the effect is to duplicate the top number on
  the stack. Consider this calculation:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  3          2:  3          1:  9          2:  9          1:  81
    .          1:  3              .          1:  9              .
                   .                             .

  3 <span class="key">RET</span>           <span class=
"key">RET</span>             *             <span class=
"key">RET</span>             *
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(Of course, an easier way to do this would be <kbd>3
  <span class="key">RET</span> 4 ^</kbd>, to raise 3 to the fourth
  power.)</p>

  <p>The space-bar key (denoted <tt class="key">SPC</tt> here)
  performs the same function as <tt class="key">RET</tt>; you could
  replace all three occurrences of <tt class="key">RET</tt> in the
  above example with <tt class="key">SPC</tt> and the effect would
  be the same.</p><a name="index-Exchanging-stack-entries" id=
  "index-Exchanging-stack-entries"></a>

  <p>Another stack manipulation key is <tt class="key">TAB</tt>.
  This exchanges the top two stack entries. Suppose you have
  computed <kbd>2 <span class="key">RET</span> 3 +</kbd> to get 5,
  and then you realize what you really wanted to compute was
  &lsquo;<samp>20 / (2+3)</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  5          2:  5          2:  20         1:  4
    .          1:  20         1:  5              .
                   .              .

 2 <span class=
"key">RET</span> 3 +         20            <span class=
"key">TAB</span>             /
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Planning ahead, the calculation would have gone like this:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  20         2:  20         3:  20         2:  20         1:  4
    .          1:  2          2:  2          1:  5              .
                   .          1:  3              .
                                  .

  20 <span class="key">RET</span>         2 <span class=
"key">RET</span>            3              +              /
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>A related stack command is <kbd>M-<span class=
  "key">TAB</span></kbd> (hold <tt class="key">META</tt> and type
  <tt class="key">TAB</tt>). It rotates the top three elements of
  the stack upward, bringing the object in level 3 to the top.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  10         2:  10         3:  10         3:  20         3:  30
    .          1:  20         2:  20         2:  30         2:  10
                   .          1:  30         1:  10         1:  20
                                  .              .              .

  10 <span class="key">RET</span>         20 <span class=
"key">RET</span>         30 <span class=
"key">RET</span>         M-<span class=
"key">TAB</span>          M-<span class="key">TAB</span>
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Suppose the numbers 10,
  20, and 30 are on the stack. Figure out how to add one to the
  number in level 2 without affecting the rest of the stack. Also
  figure out how to add one to the number in level 3. See <a href=
  "RPN-Answer-3.html#RPN-Answer-3">3</a>. (&bull;)</p>

  <p>Operations like <kbd>+</kbd>, <kbd>-</kbd>, <kbd>*</kbd>,
  <kbd>/</kbd>, and <kbd>^</kbd> pop two arguments from the stack
  and push a result. Operations like <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>Q</kbd>
  (square root) pop a single number and push the result. You can
  think of them as simply operating on the top element of the
  stack.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  3          1:  9          2:  9          1:  25         1:  5
    .              .          1:  16             .              .
                                  .

  3 <span class="key">RET</span>          <span class=
"key">RET</span> *        4 <span class=
"key">RET</span> <span class=
"key">RET</span> *        +              Q
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>(Note that capital <kbd>Q</kbd> means to hold down the Shift
  key while typing <kbd>q</kbd>. Remember, plain unshifted
  <kbd>q</kbd> is the Quit command.)</p><a name=
  "index-Pythagorean-Theorem" id="index-Pythagorean-Theorem"></a>

  <p>Here we&rsquo;ve used the Pythagorean Theorem to determine the
  hypotenuse of a right triangle. Calc actually has a built-in
  command for that called <kbd>f h</kbd>, but let&rsquo;s suppose
  we can&rsquo;t remember the necessary keystrokes. We can still
  enter it by its full name using <kbd>M-x</kbd> notation:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  3          2:  3          1:  5
    .          1:  4              .
                   .

  3 <span class="key">RET</span>          4 <span class=
"key">RET</span>      M-x calc-hypot
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>All Calculator commands begin with the word
  &lsquo;<samp>calc-</samp>&rsquo;. Since it gets tiring to type
  this, Calc provides an <kbd>x</kbd> key which is just like the
  regular Emacs <kbd>M-x</kbd> key except that it types the
  &lsquo;<samp>calc-</samp>&rsquo; prefix for you:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  3          2:  3          1:  5
    .          1:  4              .
                   .

  3 <span class="key">RET</span>          4 <span class=
"key">RET</span>         x hypot
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>What happens if you take the square root of a negative
  number?</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  4          1:  -4         1:  (0, 2)
    .              .              .

  4 <span class="key">RET</span>            n              Q
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The notation &lsquo;<samp>(a, b)</samp>&rsquo; represents a
  complex number. Complex numbers are more traditionally written
  &lsquo;<samp>a + b i</samp>&rsquo;; Calc can display in this
  format, too, but for now we&rsquo;ll stick to the
  &lsquo;<samp>(a, b)</samp>&rsquo; notation.</p>

  <p>If you don&rsquo;t know how complex numbers work, you can
  safely ignore this feature. Complex numbers only arise from
  operations that would be errors in a calculator that didn&rsquo;t
  have complex numbers. (For example, taking the square root or
  logarithm of a negative number produces a complex result.)</p>

  <p>Complex numbers are entered in the notation shown. The
  <kbd>(</kbd> and <kbd>,</kbd> and <kbd>)</kbd> keys manipulate
  &ldquo;incomplete complex numbers.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  ( ...      2:  ( ...      1:  (2, ...    1:  (2, ...    1:  (2, 3)
    .          1:  2              .              3              .
                   .                             .

    (              2              ,              3              )
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>You can perform calculations while entering parts of
  incomplete objects. However, an incomplete object cannot actually
  participate in a calculation:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">

  <p>Adding 5 to an incomplete object makes no sense, so the last
  command produces an error message and leaves the stack the
  same.</p>

  <p>Incomplete objects can&rsquo;t participate in arithmetic, but
  they can be moved around by the regular stack commands.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
2:  2          3:  2          3:  3          1:  ( ...      1:  (2, 3)
1:  3          2:  3          2:  ( ...          2              .
    .          1:  ( ...      1:  2              3
                   .              .              .

2 <span class="key">RET</span> 3 <span class=
"key">RET</span>        (            M-<span class=
"key">TAB</span>          M-<span class=
"key">TAB</span>            )
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Note that the <kbd>,</kbd> (comma) key did not have to be used
  here. When you press <kbd>)</kbd> all the stack entries between
  the incomplete entry and the top are collected, so there&rsquo;s
  never really a reason to use the comma. It&rsquo;s up to you.</p>

  <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 4.</strong> To enter the complex
  number &lsquo;<samp>(2, 3)</samp>&rsquo;, your friend Joe typed
  <kbd>( 2 , <span class="key">SPC</span> 3 )</kbd>. What happened?
  (Joe thought of a clever way to correct his mistake in only two
  keystrokes, but it didn&rsquo;t quite work. Try it to find out
  why.) See <a href="RPN-Answer-4.html#RPN-Answer-4">4</a>.

  <p>Vectors are entered the same way as complex numbers, but with
  square brackets in place of parentheses. We&rsquo;ll meet vectors
  again later in the tutorial.</p>

  <p>Any Emacs command can be given a <em>numeric prefix
  argument</em> by typing a series of <tt class=
  "key">META</tt>-digits beforehand. If <tt class="key">META</tt>
  is awkward for you, you can instead type <kbd>C-u</kbd> followed
  by the necessary digits. Numeric prefix arguments can be
  negative, as in <kbd>M-- M-3 M-5</kbd> or <kbd><span class=
  "nolinebreak">C-u</span>&nbsp;<span class=
  "nolinebreak">-</span>&nbsp;3&nbsp;5</kbd><!-- /@w -->. Calc
  commands use numeric prefix arguments in a variety of ways. For
  example, a numeric prefix on the <kbd>+</kbd> operator adds any
  number of stack entries at once:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  10         2:  10         3:  10         3:  10         1:  60
    .          1:  20         2:  20         2:  20             .
                   .          1:  30         1:  30
                                  .              .

  10 <span class="key">RET</span>         20 <span class=
"key">RET</span>         30 <span class=
"key">RET</span>         C-u 3            +
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>For stack manipulation commands like <tt class="key">RET</tt>,
  a positive numeric prefix argument operates on the top
  <var>n</var> stack entries at once. A negative argument operates
  on the entry in level <var>n</var> only. An argument of zero
  operates on the entire stack. In this example, we copy the
  second-to-top element of the stack:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  10         2:  10         3:  10         3:  10         4:  10
    .          1:  20         2:  20         2:  20         3:  20
                   .          1:  30         1:  30         2:  30
                                  .              .          1:  20
                                                                .

  10 <span class="key">RET</span>         20 <span class=
"key">RET</span>         30 <span class=
"key">RET</span>         C-u -2          <span class=
"key">RET</span>
</pre>
  </div><a name="index-Clearing-the-stack" id=
  "index-Clearing-the-stack"></a> <a name=
  "index-Emptying-the-stack" id="index-Emptying-the-stack"></a>

  <p>Another common idiom is <kbd>M-0 <span class=
  "key">DEL</span></kbd>, which clears the stack. (The
  <kbd>M-0</kbd> numeric prefix tells <tt class="key">DEL</tt> to
  operate on the entire stack.)</p>
