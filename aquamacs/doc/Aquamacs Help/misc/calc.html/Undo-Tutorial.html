  <h4 class="subsection">2.1.3 Undo and Redo</h4>

  <p>If you make a mistake, you can usually correct it by pressing
  shift-<kbd>U</kbd>, the &ldquo;undo&rdquo; command. First, clear
  the stack (<kbd>M-0 <span class="key">DEL</span></kbd>) and exit
  and restart Calc (<kbd>C-x * * C-x * *</kbd>) to make sure things
  start off with a clean slate. Now:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  2          2:  2          1:  8          2:  2          1:  6
    .          1:  3              .          1:  3              .
                   .                             .

   2 <span class=
"key">RET</span>           3              ^              U              *
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>You can undo any number of times. Calc keeps a complete record
  of all you have done since you last opened the Calc window. After
  the above example, you could type:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
1:  6          2:  2          1:  2              .              .
    .          1:  3              .
                   .
                                                             (error)
                   U              U              U              U
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>You can also type <kbd>D</kbd> to &ldquo;redo&rdquo; a command
  that you have undone mistakenly.</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
    .          1:  2          2:  2          1:  6          1:  6
                   .          1:  3              .              .
                                  .
                                                             (error)
                   D              D              D              D
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>It was not possible to redo past the
  &lsquo;<samp>6</samp>&rsquo;, since that was placed there by
  something other than an undo command.</p><a name=
  "index-Time-travel" id="index-Time-travel"></a>

  <p>You can think of undo and redo as a sort of &ldquo;time
  machine.&rdquo; Press <kbd>U</kbd> to go backward in time,
  <kbd>D</kbd> to go forward. If you go backward and do something
  (like <kbd>*</kbd>) then, as any science fiction reader knows,
  you have changed your future and you cannot go forward again.
  Thus, the inability to redo past the &lsquo;<samp>6</samp>&rsquo;
  even though there was an earlier undo command.</p>

  <p>You can always recall an earlier result using the Trail.
  We&rsquo;ve ignored the trail so far, but it has been faithfully
  recording everything we did since we loaded the Calculator. If
  the Trail is not displayed, press <kbd>t d</kbd> now to turn it
  on.</p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s try grabbing an earlier result. The
  &lsquo;<samp>8</samp>&rsquo; we computed was undone by a
  <kbd>U</kbd> command, and was lost even to Redo when we pressed
  <kbd>*</kbd>, but it&rsquo;s still there in the trail. There
  should be a little &lsquo;<samp>&gt;</samp>&rsquo; arrow (the
  <em>trail pointer</em>) resting on the last trail entry. If there
  isn&rsquo;t, press <kbd>t ]</kbd> to reset the trail pointer.
  Now, press <kbd>t&nbsp;p</kbd><!-- /@w --> to move the arrow onto
  the line containing &lsquo;<samp>8</samp>&rsquo;, and press
  <kbd>t&nbsp;y</kbd><!-- /@w --> to &ldquo;yank&rdquo; that number
  back onto the stack.</p>

  <p>If you press <kbd>t ]</kbd> again, you will see that even our
  Yank command went into the trail.</p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s go further back in time. Earlier in the tutorial
  we computed a huge integer using the formula
  &lsquo;<samp>2^3^4</samp>&rsquo;. We don&rsquo;t remember what it
  was, but the first digits were &ldquo;241&rdquo;. Press <kbd>t
  r</kbd> (which stands for trail-search-reverse), then type
  <kbd>241</kbd>. The trail cursor will jump back to the next
  previous occurrence of the string &ldquo;241&rdquo; in the trail.
  This is just a regular Emacs incremental search; you can now
  press <kbd>C-s</kbd> or <kbd>C-r</kbd> to continue the search
  forwards or backwards as you like.</p>

  <p>To finish the search, press <tt class="key">RET</tt>. This
  halts the incremental search and leaves the trail pointer at the
  thing we found. Now we can type <kbd>t y</kbd> to yank that
  number onto the stack. If we hadn&rsquo;t remembered the
  &ldquo;241&rdquo;, we could simply have searched for
  <kbd>2^3^4</kbd>, then pressed <kbd><span class="key">RET</span>
  t n</kbd> to halt and then move to the next item.</p>

  <p>You may have noticed that all the trail-related commands begin
  with the letter <kbd>t</kbd>. (The store-and-recall commands, on
  the other hand, all began with <kbd>s</kbd>.) Calc has so many
  commands that there aren&rsquo;t enough keys for all of them, so
  various commands are grouped into two-letter sequences where the
  first letter is called the <em>prefix</em> key. If you type a
  prefix key by accident, you can press <kbd>C-g</kbd> to cancel
  it. (In fact, you can press <kbd>C-g</kbd> to cancel almost
  anything in Emacs.) To get help on a prefix key, press that key
  followed by <kbd>?</kbd>. Some prefixes have several lines of
  help, so you need to press <kbd>?</kbd> repeatedly to see them
  all. You can also type <kbd>h h</kbd> to see all the help at
  once.</p>

  <p>Try pressing <kbd>t ?</kbd> now. You will see a line of the
  form,</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
trail/time: Display; Fwd, Back; Next, Prev, Here, [, ]; Yank:  [MORE]  t-
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The word &ldquo;trail&rdquo; indicates that the <kbd>t</kbd>
  prefix key contains trail-related commands. Each entry on the
  line shows one command, with a single capital letter showing
  which letter you press to get that command. We have used <kbd>t
  n</kbd>, <kbd>t p</kbd>, <kbd>t ]</kbd>, and <kbd>t y</kbd> so
  far. The &lsquo;<samp>[MORE]</samp>&rsquo; means you can press
  <kbd>?</kbd> again to see more <kbd>t</kbd>-prefix commands.
  Notice that the commands are roughly divided (by semicolons) into
  related groups.</p>

  <p>When you are in the help display for a prefix key, the prefix
  is still active. If you press another key, like <kbd>y</kbd> for
  example, it will be interpreted as a <kbd>t y</kbd> command. If
  all you wanted was to look at the help messages, press
  <kbd>C-g</kbd> afterwards to cancel the prefix.</p>

  <p>One more way to correct an error is by editing the stack
  entries. The actual Stack buffer is marked read-only and must not
  be edited directly, but you can press <kbd>`</kbd> (grave accent)
  to edit a stack entry.</p>

  <p>Try entering &lsquo;<samp>3.141439</samp>&rsquo; now. If this
  is supposed to represent &lsquo;<samp>pi</samp>&rsquo;,
  it&rsquo;s got several errors. Press <kbd>`</kbd> to edit this
  number. Now use the normal Emacs cursor motion and editing keys
  to change the second 4 to a 5, and to transpose the 3 and the 9.
  When you press <tt class="key">RET</tt>, the number on the stack
  will be replaced by your new number. This works for formulas,
  vectors, and all other types of values you can put on the stack.
  The <kbd>`</kbd> key also works during entry of a number or
  algebraic formula.</p>
