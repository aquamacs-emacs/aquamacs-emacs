  <p>Calc&rsquo;s standard interface acts like a traditional RPN
  calculator, operated by the normal Emacs keyboard. When you type
  <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> to start the Calculator, the Emacs screen
  splits into two windows with the file you were editing on top and
  Calc on the bottom.</p>

</pre>
  </div>

  <p>In this figure, the mode-line for <samp>myfile</samp> has
  moved up and the &ldquo;Calculator&rdquo; window has appeared
  below it. As you can see, Calc actually makes two windows
  side-by-side. The lefthand one is called the <em>stack
  window</em> and the righthand one is called the <em>trail
  window.</em> The stack holds the numbers involved in the
  calculation you are currently performing. The trail holds a
  complete record of all calculations you have done. In a desk
  calculator with a printer, the trail corresponds to the paper
  tape that records what you do.</p>

  <p>In this case, the trail shows that four numbers (17.3, 3, 2,
  and 4) were first entered into the Calculator, then the 2 and 4
  were multiplied to get 8, then the 3 and 8 were subtracted to get
  <i>-5</i>. (The &lsquo;<samp>&gt;</samp>&rsquo; symbol shows that
  this was the most recent calculation.) The net result is the two
  numbers 17.3 and <i>-5</i> sitting on the stack.</p>

  <p>Most Calculator commands deal explicitly with the stack only,
  but there is a set of commands that allow you to search back
  through the trail and retrieve any previous result.</p>

  <p>Calc commands use the digits, letters, and punctuation keys.
  Shifted (i.e., upper-case) letters are different from lowercase
  letters. Some letters are <em>prefix</em> keys that begin
  two-letter commands. For example, <kbd>e</kbd> means &ldquo;enter
  exponent&rdquo; and shifted <kbd>E</kbd> means
  &lsquo;<samp>e^x</samp>&rsquo;. With the <kbd>d</kbd>
  (&ldquo;display modes&rdquo;) prefix the letter &ldquo;e&rdquo;
  takes on very different meanings: <kbd>d e</kbd> means
  &ldquo;engineering notation&rdquo; and <kbd>d E</kbd> means
  &ldquo;<em>eqn</em> language mode.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There is nothing stopping you from switching out of the Calc
  window and back into your editing window, say by using the Emacs
  <kbd><span class="nolinebreak">C-x</span>&nbsp;o</kbd> 
  <!-- /@w --> (<code>other-window</code>) command. When the cursor
  is inside a regular window, Emacs acts just like normal. When the
  cursor is in the Calc stack or trail windows, keys are
  interpreted as Calc commands.</p>

  <p>When you quit by pressing <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> a second time,
  the Calculator windows go away but the actual Stack and Trail are
  not gone, just hidden. When you press <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> once
  again you will get the same stack and trail contents you had when
  you last used the Calculator.</p>

  <p>The Calculator does not remember its state between Emacs
  sessions. Thus if you quit Emacs and start it again, <kbd>C-x *
  c</kbd> will give you a fresh stack and trail. There is a command
  (<kbd>m m</kbd>) that lets you save your favorite mode settings
  between sessions, though. One of the things it saves is which
  user interface (standard or Keypad) you last used; otherwise, a
  freshly started Emacs will always treat <kbd>C-x * *</kbd> the
  same as <kbd>C-x * c</kbd>.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>q</kbd> key is another equivalent way to turn the
  Calculator off.</p>

  <p>If you type <kbd>C-x * b</kbd> first and then <kbd>C-x *
  c</kbd>, you get a full-screen version of Calc
  (<code>full-calc</code>) in which the stack and trail windows are
  still side-by-side but are now as tall as the whole Emacs screen.
  When you press <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> again to quit,
  the file you were editing before reappears. The <kbd>C-x *
  b</kbd> key switches back and forth between &ldquo;big&rdquo;
  full-screen mode and the normal partial-screen mode.</p>

  <p>Finally, <kbd>C-x * o</kbd> (<code>calc-other-window</code>)
  is like <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> except that the Calc window is not
  selected. The buffer you were editing before remains selected
  instead. If you are in a Calc window, then <kbd>C-x * o</kbd>
  will switch you out of it, being careful not to switch you to the
  Calc Trail window. So <kbd>C-x * o</kbd> is a handy way to switch
  out of Calc momentarily to edit your file; you can then type
  <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> to switch back into Calc when you are
  done.</p>
