Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

  <ol>
    <li>PREAMBLE

      <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
      or other functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the
      sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to
      copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it,
      either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this
      License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
      credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
      for modifications made by others.</p>

      <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which
      means that derivative works of the document must themselves
      be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General
      Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
      software.</p>

      <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for
      manuals for free software, because free software needs free
      documentation: a free program should come with manuals
      providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
      License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
      for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether
      it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
      principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
      reference.</p>
    </li>

    <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

      <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any
      medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
      saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License.
      Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license,
      unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions
      stated herein. The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below, refers to
      any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
      licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;. You accept
      the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
      way requiring permission under copyright law.</p>

      <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any
      work containing the Document or a portion of it, either
      copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into
      another language.</p>

      <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a
      front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively
      with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the
      Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall subject (or to
      related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
      directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document
      is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may
      not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
      matter of historical connection with the subject or with
      related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical,
      ethical or political position regarding them.</p>

      <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary
      Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
      Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document
      is released under this License. If a section does not fit the
      above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
      designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
      Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any
      Invariant Sections then there are none.</p>

      <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages
      of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover
      Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released
      under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
      words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</p>

      <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a
      machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose
      specification is available to the general public, that is
      suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
      generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels)
      generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
      available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
      text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
      formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in
      an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence
      of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An
      image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial
      amount of text. A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo;
      is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies
      include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format,
      LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
      DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF
      designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
      image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
      include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
      by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD
      and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
      machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some
      word processors for output purposes only.</p>

      <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book,
      the title page itself, plus such following pages as are
      needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires
      to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do
      not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo;
      means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
      work&rsquo;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of
      the text.</p>

      <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity
      that distributes copies of the Document to the public.</p>

      <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit
      of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or
      contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates
      XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific
      section name mentioned below, such as
      &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;,
      &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.) To
      &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo; of such a section when you
      modify the Document means that it remains a section
      &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.</p>

      <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the
      notice which states that this License applies to the
      Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be
      included by reference in this License, but only as regards
      disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these
      Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on
      the meaning of this License.</p>
    </li>

    <li>VERBATIM COPYING

      <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
      either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
      License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying
      this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all
      copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to
      those of this License. You may not use technical measures to
      obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
      copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
      compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a
      large enough number of copies you must also follow the
      conditions in section 3.</p>

      <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
      above, and you may publicly display copies.</p>
    </li>

    <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

      <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that
      commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more
      than 100, and the Document&rsquo;s license notice requires
      Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
      carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
      Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
      the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly
      identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
      cover must present the full title with all words of the title
      equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on
      the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the
      covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document
      and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
      copying in other respects.</p>

      <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous
      to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many
      as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest
      onto adjacent pages.</p>

      <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
      numbering more than 100, you must either include a
      machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque
      copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network
      location from which the general network-using public has
      access to download using public-standard network protocols a
      complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
      material. If you use the latter option, you must take
      reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of
      Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
      copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
      at least one year after the last time you distribute an
      Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of
      that edition to the public.</p>

      <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
      authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
      number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with
      an updated version of the Document.</p>
    </li>

    <li>MODIFICATIONS

      <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
      Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above,
      provided that you release the Modified Version under
      precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
      role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
      modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a
      copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
      Modified Version:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a
        title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
        previous versions (which should, if there were any, be
        listed in the History section of the Document). You may use
        the same title as a previous version if the original
        publisher of that version gives permission.</li>

        <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons
        or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications
        in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
        principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
        authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release
        you from this requirement.</li>

        <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of
        the Modified Version, as the publisher.</li>

        <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the
        Document.</li>

        <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
        modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.</li>

        <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a
        license notice giving the public permission to use the
        Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the
        form shown in the Addendum below.</li>

        <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of
        Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the
        Document&rsquo;s license notice.</li>

        <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.</li>

        <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;,
        Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least
        the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified
        Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
        Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
        stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
        Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
        describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
        sentence.</li>

        <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
        Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the
        Document, and likewise the network locations given in the
        Document for previous versions it was based on. These may
        be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. You may
        omit a network location for a work that was published at
        least four years before the Document itself, or if the
        original publisher of the version it refers to gives
        permission.</li>

        <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;
        or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve the Title of the
        section, and preserve in the section all the substance and
        tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
        dedications given therein.</li>

        <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
        unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section
        numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the
        section titles.</li>

        <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.
        Such a section may not be included in the Modified
        Version.</li>

        <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
        &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or to conflict in title with any
        Invariant Section.</li>

        <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
      or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain
      no material copied from the Document, you may at your option
      designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do
      this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in
      the Modified Version&rsquo;s license notice. These titles
      must be distinct from any other section titles.</p>

      <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;,
      provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your
      Modified Version by various parties&mdash;for example,
      statements of peer review or that the text has been approved
      by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
      standard.</p>

      <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
      Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text,
      to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified
      Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of
      Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
      by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover
      text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
      arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf
      of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
      on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
      the old one.</p>

      <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
      this License give permission to use their names for publicity
      for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified
      Version.</p>
    </li>

    <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

      <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released
      under this License, under the terms defined in section 4
      above for modified versions, provided that you include in the
      combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the
      original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
      Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
      notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty
      Disclaimers.</p>

      <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
      License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be
      replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant
      Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
      title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it,
      in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher
      of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the
      same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
      Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined
      work.</p>

      <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
      &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the various original documents,
      forming one section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise
      combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
      and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;. You must
      delete all sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;</p>
    </li>

    <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

      <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
      other documents released under this License, and replace the
      individual copies of this License in the various documents
      with a single copy that is included in the collection,
      provided that you follow the rules of this License for
      verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
      respects.</p>

      <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
      and distribute it individually under this License, provided
      you insert a copy of this License into the extracted
      document, and follow this License in all other respects
      regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p>
    </li>

    <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

      <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with
      other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a
      volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
      &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright resulting from the
      compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
      compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works
      permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
      License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate
      which are not themselves derivative works of the
      Document.</p>

      <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable
      to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less
      than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s
      Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document
      within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
      if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must
      appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
      aggregate.</p>
    </li>

    <li>TRANSLATION

      <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you
      may distribute translations of the Document under the terms
      of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations
      requires special permission from their copyright holders, but
      you may include translations of some or all Invariant
      Sections in addition to the original versions of these
      Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this
      License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any
      Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the
      original English version of this License and the original
      versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
      disagreement between the translation and the original version
      of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original
      version will prevail.</p>

      <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled
      &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or
      &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to
      Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require
      changing the actual title.</p>
    </li>

    <li>TERMINATION

      <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
      Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any
      attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
      it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
      under this License.</p>

      <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then
      your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
      (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder
      explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
      permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of
      the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after
      the cessation.</p>

      <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder
      is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies
      you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the
      first time you have received notice of violation of this
      License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you
      cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
      notice.</p>

      <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not
      terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or
      rights from you under this License. If your rights have been
      terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy
      of some or all of the same material does not give you any
      rights to use it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

      <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
      versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to
      time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
      present version, but may differ in detail to address new
      problems or concerns. See <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.</p>

      <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
      version number. If the Document specifies that a particular
      numbered version of this License &ldquo;or any later
      version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
      following the terms and conditions either of that specified
      version or of any later version that has been published (not
      as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
      does not specify a version number of this License, you may
      choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
      Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a
      proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be
      used, that proxy&rsquo;s public statement of acceptance of a
      version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
      the Document.</p>
    </li>

    <li>RELICENSING

      <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or
      &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any World Wide Web server that
      publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent
      facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki
      that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
      &ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or
      &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the site means any set of
      copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons
      Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative
      Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a
      principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as
      well as future copyleft versions of that license published by
      that same organization.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a
      Document, in whole or in part, as part of another
      Document.</p>

      <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is
      licensed under this License, and if all works that were first
      published under this License somewhere other than this MMC,
      and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the
      MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2)
      were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.</p>

      <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained
      in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time
      before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for
      relicensing.</p>

  <h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your
  documents</h3>

  <p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a
  copy of the License in the document and put the following
  copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and
  Back-Cover Texts, replace the &ldquo;with&hellip;Texts.&rdquo;
  line with this:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some
  other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to
  suit the situation.</p>

  <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code,
  we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
  choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
  License, to permit their use in free software.</p><a name=
