  <h3 class="section">7.4 Score File Format</h3><a name=
  "index-score-file-format" id="index-score-file-format"></a>

  <p>A score file is an <code>emacs-lisp</code> file that normally
  contains just a single form. Casual users are not expected to
  edit these files; everything can be changed from the summary
  buffer.</p>

  <p>Anyway, if you&rsquo;d like to dig into it yourself,
  here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

  <div class="lisp">
    <pre class="lisp">
(("from"
  ("Lars Ingebrigtsen" -10000)
  ("Per Abrahamsen")
  ("larsi\\|lmi" -50000 nil R))
 ("subject"
  ("Ding is Badd" nil 728373))
 ("xref"
  ("alt.politics" -1000 728372 s))
 ("lines"
  (2 -100 nil &lt;))
 (mark 0)
 (expunge -1000)
 (mark-and-expunge -10)
 (read-only nil)
 (orphan -10)
 (adapt t)
 (files "/hom/larsi/News/gnu.SCORE")
 (exclude-files "all.SCORE")
 (local (gnus-newsgroup-auto-expire t)
        (gnus-summary-make-false-root empty))
 (eval (ding)))
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>This example demonstrates most score file elements. See
  <a href="Advanced-Scoring.html#Advanced-Scoring">Advanced
  Scoring</a>, for a different approach.</p>

  <p>Even though this looks much like Lisp code, nothing here is
  actually <code>eval</code>ed. The Lisp reader is used to read
  this form, though, so it has to be valid syntactically, if not
  semantically.</p>

  <p>Six keys are supported by this alist:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt><code>STRING</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>If the key is a string, it is the name of the header to
      perform the match on. Scoring can only be performed on these
      eight headers: <code>From</code>, <code>Subject</code>,
      <code>References</code>, <code>Message-ID</code>,
      <code>Xref</code>, <code>Lines</code>, <code>Chars</code> and
      <code>Date</code>. In addition to these headers, there are
      three strings to tell Gnus to fetch the entire article and do
      the match on larger parts of the article: <code>Body</code>
      will perform the match on the body of the article,
      <code>Head</code> will perform the match on the head of the
      article, and <code>All</code> will perform the match on the
      entire article. Note that using any of these last three keys
      will slow down group entry <em>considerably</em>. The final
      &ldquo;header&rdquo; you can score on is
      <code>Followup</code>. These score entries will result in new
      score entries being added for all follow-ups to articles that
      matches these score entries.</p>

      <p>Following this key is an arbitrary number of score
      entries, where each score entry has one to four elements.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The first element is the <em>match element</em>. On
        most headers this will be a string, but on the Lines and
        Chars headers, this must be an integer.</li>

        <li>If the second element is present, it should be a
        number&mdash;the <em>score element</em>. This number should
        be an integer in the neginf to posinf interval. This number
        is added to the score of the article if the match is
        successful. If this element is not present, the
        <code>gnus-score-interactive-default-score</code> number
        will be used instead. This is 1000 by default.</li>

        <li>If the third element is present, it should be a
        number&mdash;the <em>date element</em>. This date says when
        the last time this score entry matched, which provides a
        mechanism for expiring the score entries. It this element
        is not present, the score entry is permanent. The date is
        represented by the number of days since December 31, 1
        BCE.</li>

        <li>If the fourth element is present, it should be a
        symbol&mdash;the <em>type element</em>. This element
        specifies what function should be used to see whether this
        score entry matches the article. What match types that can
        be used depends on what header you wish to perform the
        match on.

          <dl compact="compact">
            <dt><em>From, Subject, References, Xref,
            Message-ID</em></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>For most header types, there are the
              <code>r</code> and <code>R</code> (regexp), as well
              as <code>s</code> and <code>S</code> (substring)
              types, and <code>e</code> and <code>E</code> (exact
              match), and <code>w</code> (word match) types. If
              this element is not present, Gnus will assume that
              substring matching should be used. <code>R</code>,
              <code>S</code>, and <code>E</code> differ from the
              others in that the matches will be done in a
              case-sensitive manner. All these one-letter types are
              really just abbreviations for the
              <code>regexp</code>, <code>string</code>,
              <code>exact</code>, and <code>word</code> types,
              which you can use instead, if you feel like.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><em>Extra</em></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Just as for the standard string overview headers,
              if you are using gnus-extra-headers, you can score on
              these headers&rsquo; values. In this case, there is a
              5th element in the score entry, being the name of the
              header to be scored. The following entry is useful in
              your <samp>all.SCORE</samp> file in case of spam
              attacks from a single origin host, if your
              <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server tracks
              &lsquo;<samp>NNTP-Posting-Host</samp>&rsquo; in
              overviews:</p>

              <div class="lisp">
                <pre class="lisp">
("111.222.333.444" -1000 nil s
 "NNTP-Posting-Host")
</pre>
              </div>
            </dd>

            <dt><em>Lines, Chars</em></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>These two headers use different match types:
              <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>=</code>,
              <code>&gt;=</code> and <code>&lt;=</code>.</p>

              <p>These predicates are true if</p>

              <div class="example">
                <pre class="example">
(PREDICATE HEADER MATCH)
</pre>
              </div>

              <p>evaluates to non-<code>nil</code>. For instance,
              the advanced match <code>("lines" 4 &lt;)</code> (see
              <a href=
              "Advanced-Scoring.html#Advanced-Scoring">Advanced
              Scoring</a>) will result in the following form:</p>

              <div class="lisp">
                <pre class="lisp">
(&lt; header-value 4)
</pre>
              </div>

              <p>Or to put it another way: When using
              <code>&lt;</code> on <code>Lines</code> with 4 as the
              match, we get the score added if the article has less
              than 4 lines. (It&rsquo;s easy to get confused and
              think it&rsquo;s the other way around. But it&rsquo;s
              not. I think.)</p>

              <p>When matching on <code>Lines</code>, be careful
              because some back ends (like <code>nndir</code>) do
              not generate <code>Lines</code> header, so every
              article ends up being marked as having 0 lines. This
              can lead to strange results if you happen to lower
              score of the articles with few lines.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><em>Date</em></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>For the Date header we have three kinda silly
              match types: <code>before</code>, <code>at</code> and
              <code>after</code>. I can&rsquo;t really imagine this
              ever being useful, but, like, it would feel kinda
              silly not to provide this function. Just in case. You
              never know. Better safe than sorry. Once burnt, twice
              shy. Don&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover. Never not
              have sex on a first date. (I have been told that at
              least one person, and I quote, &ldquo;found this
              function indispensable&rdquo;, however.)</p><a name=
              "index-ISO8601" id="index-ISO8601"></a> <a name=
              "index-date" id="index-date"></a>

              <p>A more useful match type is <code>regexp</code>.
              With it, you can match the date string using a
              regular expression. The date is normalized to ISO8601
              compact format
              first&mdash;<var>YYYYMMDD</var><code>T</code><var>HHMMSS</var>.
              If you want to match all articles that have been
              posted on April 1st in every year, you could use
              &lsquo;<samp>....0401.........</samp>&rsquo; as a
              match string, for instance. (Note that the date is
              kept in its original time zone, so this will match
              articles that were posted when it was April 1st where
              the article was posted from. Time zones are such
              wholesome fun for the whole family, eh?)</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><em>Head, Body, All</em></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>These three match keys use the same match types as
              the <code>From</code> (etc.) header uses.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><em>Followup</em></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This match key is somewhat special, in that it
              will match the <code>From</code> header, and affect
              the score of not only the matching articles, but also
              all followups to the matching articles. This allows
              you to increase the score of followups to your own
              articles, or decrease the score of followups to the
              articles of some known trouble-maker. Uses the same
              match types as the <code>From</code> header uses.
              (Using this match key will lead to creation of
              <samp>ADAPT</samp> files.)</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><em>Thread</em></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This match key works along the same lines as the
              <code>Followup</code> match key. If you say that you
              want to score on a (sub-)thread started by an article
              with a <code>Message-ID</code> <var>x</var>, then you
              add a &lsquo;<samp>thread</samp>&rsquo; match. This
              will add a new &lsquo;<samp>thread</samp>&rsquo;
              match for each article that has <var>x</var> in its
              <code>References</code> header. (These new
              &lsquo;<samp>thread</samp>&rsquo; matches will use
              the <code>Message-ID</code>s of these matching
              articles.) This will ensure that you can raise/lower
              the score of an entire thread, even though some
              articles in the thread may not have complete
              <code>References</code> headers. Note that using this
              may lead to nondeterministic scores of the articles
              in the thread. (Using this match key will lead to
              creation of <samp>ADAPT</samp> files.)</p>

    <dd>
      <p>Read-only score files will not be updated or saved. Global
      score files should feature this atom (see <a href=
      "Global-Score-Files.html#Global-Score-Files">Global Score
      Files</a>). (Note: <em>Global</em> here really means
      <em>global</em>; not your personal apply-to-all-groups score
      files.)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>orphan</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The value of this entry should be a number. Articles that
      do not have parents will get this number added to their
      scores. Imagine you follow some high-volume newsgroup, like
      &lsquo;<samp>comp.lang.c</samp>&rsquo;. Most likely you will
      only follow a few of the threads, also want to see any new
      threads.</p>

      <p>You can do this with the following two score file
      entries:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
        (orphan -500)
        (mark-and-expunge -100)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>When you enter the group the first time, you will only see
      the new threads. You then raise the score of the threads that
      you find interesting (with <kbd>I T</kbd> or <kbd>I S</kbd>),
      and ignore (<kbd>c y</kbd>) the rest. Next time you enter the
      group, you will see new articles in the interesting threads,
      plus any new threads.</p>

      <p>I.e., the orphan score atom is for high-volume groups
      where a few interesting threads which can&rsquo;t be found
      automatically by ordinary scoring rules exist.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>adapt</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This entry controls the adaptive scoring. If it is
      <code>t</code>, the default adaptive scoring rules will be
      used. If it is <code>ignore</code>, no adaptive scoring will
      be performed on this group. If it is a list, this list will
      be used as the adaptive scoring rules. If it isn&rsquo;t
      present, or is something other than <code>t</code> or
      <code>ignore</code>, the default adaptive scoring rules will
      be used. If you want to use adaptive scoring on most groups,
      you&rsquo;d set <code>gnus-use-adaptive-scoring</code> to
      <code>t</code>, and insert an <code>(adapt ignore)</code> in
      the groups where you do not want adaptive scoring. If you
      only want adaptive scoring in a few groups, you&rsquo;d set
      <code>gnus-use-adaptive-scoring</code> to <code>nil</code>,
      and insert <code>(adapt t)</code> in the score files of the
      groups where you want it.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>adapt-file</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>All adaptive score entries will go to the file named by
      this entry. It will also be applied when entering the group.
      This atom might be handy if you want to adapt on several
      groups at once, using the same adaptive file for a number of
      groups.</p>
    </dd>

      <code>(<var>var</var> <var>value</var>)</code> pairs. Each
      <var>var</var> will be made buffer-local to the current
      summary buffer, and set to the value specified. This is a
      convenient, if somewhat strange, way of setting variables in
      some groups if you don&rsquo;t like hooks much. Note that the
      <var>value</var> won&rsquo;t be evaluated.</p>
