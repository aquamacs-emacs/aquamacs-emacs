     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">5.41 How can I go to a certain line given its number?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Going-to-a-line-by-number-303"></a><a name="index-Compilation-error-messages-304"></a><a name="index-Recompilation-305"></a>
Are you sure you indeed need to go to a line by its number?  Perhaps all
you want is to display a line in your source file for which a compiler
printed an error message?  If so, compiling from within Emacs using the
<kbd>M-x compile</kbd> and <kbd>M-x recompile</kbd> commands is a much more
effective way of doing that.  Emacs automatically intercepts the compile
error messages, inserts them into a special buffer called
<code>*compilation*</code>, and lets you visit the locus of each message in
the source.  Type <kbd>C-x `</kbd> to step through the offending lines one by
one (starting with Emacs 22, you can also use <kbd>M-g M-p</kbd> and
<kbd>M-g M-n</kbd> to go to the previous and next matches directly).  Click
<kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> or press &lt;RET&gt; on a message text in the
<code>*compilation*</code> buffer to go to the line whose number is mentioned
in that message.

   <p>But if you indeed need to go to a certain text line, type <kbd>M-g M-g</kbd>
(which is the default binding of the <code>goto-line</code> function starting
with Emacs 22).  Emacs will prompt you for the number of the line and go
to that line.

   <p>You can do this faster by invoking <code>goto-line</code> with a numeric
argument that is the line's number.  For example, <kbd>C-u 286 M-g M-g</kbd>
will jump to line number 286 in the current buffer.
