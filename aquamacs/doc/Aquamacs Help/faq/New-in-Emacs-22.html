     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">4.4 What is different about Emacs 22?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Differences-between-Emacs-21-and-Emacs-22-140"></a><a name="index-Emacs-22_002c-new-features-in-141"></a>
     
<a name="index-GTK_002b-Toolkit-142"></a>
<a name="index-Drag_002dand_002ddrop-143"></a>
<ul><li>Emacs can be built with GTK+ widgets, and supports drag-and-drop
operation on X.

     <p><a name="index-Supported-systems-144"></a><li>Emacs 22 features support for GNU/Linux systems on S390 and x86-64
machines, as well as support for the Mac OS X and Cygwin operating
systems.

     <li>The native MS-Windows, and Mac OS X builds include full support
for images, toolbar, and tooltips.

     <li>Font Lock mode, Auto Compression mode, and File Name Shadow Mode are
enabled by default.

     <li>The maximum size of buffers is increased: on 32-bit machines, it is
256 MBytes for Emacs 23.1, and 512 MBytes for Emacs 23.2 and above.

     <li>Links can be followed with <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>, in addition to <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>.

     <p><a name="index-Mouse-wheel-145"></a><li>Mouse wheel support is enabled by default.

     <li>Window fringes are customizable.

     <li>The mode line of the selected window is now highlighted.

     <li>The minibuffer prompt is displayed in a distinct face.

     <li>Abbrev definitions are read automatically at startup.

     <li>Grep mode is separate from Compilation mode and has many new options and
commands specific to grep.

     <li>The original Emacs macro system has been replaced by the new Kmacro
package, which provides many new commands and features and a simple
interface that uses the function keys F3 and F4.  Macros are stored in a
macro ring, and can be debugged and edited interactively.

     <li>The Grand Unified Debugger (GUD) can be used with a full graphical user
interface to GDB; this provides many features found in traditional
development environments, making it easy to manipulate breakpoints, add
watch points, display the call stack, etc.  Breakpoints are visually
indicated in the source buffer.

     <li><a name="index-New-modes-146"></a>Many new modes and packages have been included in Emacs, such as Calc,
TRAMP, URL, IDO, CUA, ERC, rcirc, Table, Image-Dired, SES, Ruler, Org,
PGG, Flymake, Password, Printing, Reveal, wdired, t-mouse, longlines,
savehist, Conf mode, Python mode, DNS mode, etc.

     <p><a name="index-Multilingual-Environment-147"></a><li>Leim is now part of Emacs.  Unicode support has been much improved, and
the following input methods have been added: belarusian, bulgarian-bds,
bulgarian-phonetic, chinese-sisheng, croatian, dutch, georgian,
latin-alt-postfix, latin-postfix, latin-prefix, latvian-keyboard,
lithuanian-numeric, lithuanian-keyboard, malayalam-inscript, rfc1345,
russian-computer, sgml, slovenian, tamil-inscript, ucs,
ukrainian-computer, vietnamese-telex, and welsh.

     <p>The following language environments have also been added: Belarusian,
Bulgarian, Chinese-EUC-TW, Croatian, French, Georgian, Italian, Latin-6,
Latin-7, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Russian, Slovenian, Swedish,
Tajik, Tamil, UTF-8, Ukrainian, Welsh, and Windows-1255.

     <p><a name="index-Documentation-148"></a><a name="index-Emacs-Lisp-Manual-149"></a><li>In addition, Emacs 22 now includes the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual
(see <a href="Emacs-Lisp-documentation.html#Emacs-Lisp-documentation">Emacs Lisp documentation</a>) and the Emacs Lisp Intro. 
</ul>
