     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">10.6 Why does the &lt;Backspace&gt; key invoke help?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Backspace-key-invokes-help-459"></a><a name="index-Help-invoked-by-Backspace-460"></a><a name="index-DEL-key-does-not-delete-461"></a>
The &lt;Backspace&gt; key (on most keyboards) generates <acronym>ASCII</acronym> code 8. 
<kbd>C-h</kbd> sends the same code.  In Emacs by default <kbd>C-h</kbd> invokes
help-command.  This is intended to be easy to remember since the first
letter of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">help</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The easiest solution to this problem
is to use <kbd>C-h</kbd> (and &lt;Backspace&gt;) for help and &lt;DEL&gt; (the
&lt;Delete&gt; key) for deleting the previous character.

   <p>For many people this solution may be problematic:

     <ul>
<li>They normally use &lt;Backspace&gt; outside of Emacs for deleting the
previous character.  This can be solved by making &lt;DEL&gt; the command
for deleting the previous character outside of Emacs.  On many Unix
systems, this command will remap &lt;DEL&gt;:

     <pre class="example">          stty erase `^?'
</pre>
     <li>The user may prefer the &lt;Backspace&gt; key for deleting the
previous character because it is more conveniently located on their
keyboard or because they don't even have a separate &lt;Delete&gt; key. 
In this case, the &lt;Backspace&gt; key should be made to behave like
&lt;Delete&gt;.  There are several methods.

          <ul>
<li>Some terminals (e.g., VT3## terminals) and terminal emulators (e.g.,
TeraTerm) allow the character generated by the &lt;Backspace&gt; key to be
changed from a setup menu.

          <li>You may be able to get a keyboard that is completely programmable, or a
terminal emulator that supports remapping of any key to any other key.

          <li>With Emacs 21.1 and later, you can control the effect of the
&lt;Backspace&gt; and &lt;Delete&gt; keys, on both dumb terminals and a
windowed displays, by customizing the option
<code>normal-erase-is-backspace-mode</code>, or by invoking <kbd>M-x
normal-erase-is-backspace</kbd>.  See the documentation of these symbols
(see <a href="Emacs-Lisp-documentation.html#Emacs-Lisp-documentation">Emacs Lisp documentation</a>) for more info.

          <li>It is possible to swap the &lt;Backspace&gt; and &lt;DEL&gt; keys inside
Emacs:

          <pre class="lisp">               (keyboard-translate ?\C-h ?\C-?)
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">This is the recommended method of forcing &lt;Backspace&gt; to act as
&lt;DEL&gt;, because it works even in modes which bind &lt;DEL&gt; to
something other than <code>delete-backward-char</code>.

          <p>Similarly, you could remap &lt;DEL&gt; to act as <kbd>C-d</kbd>, which by
default deletes forward:

          <pre class="lisp">               (keyboard-translate ?\C-? ?\C-d)
</pre>
          <p>See <a href="Swapping-keys.html#Swapping-keys">Swapping keys</a>, for further details about <code>keyboard-translate</code>.

          <li>Another approach is to switch key bindings and put help on <kbd>C-x h</kbd>
instead:

          <pre class="lisp">               (global-set-key "\C-h" 'delete-backward-char)
               
               ;; overrides mark-whole-buffer
               (global-set-key "\C-xh" 'help-command)
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">This method is not recommended, though: it only solves the problem for
those modes which bind &lt;DEL&gt; to <code>delete-backward-char</code>.  Modes
which bind &lt;DEL&gt; to something else, such as <code>view-mode</code>, will
not work as you expect when you press the &lt;Backspace&gt; key.  For this
reason, we recommend the <code>keyboard-translate</code> method, shown
above.

          <p>Other popular key bindings for help are <kbd>M-?</kbd> and <kbd>C-x ?</kbd>. 
</ul>

     <p>Don't try to bind &lt;DEL&gt; to <code>help-command</code>, because there are
many modes that have local bindings of &lt;DEL&gt; that will interfere.

   </ul>

   <p>When Emacs 21 or later runs on a windowed display, it binds the
&lt;Delete&gt; key to a command which deletes the character at point, to
make Emacs more consistent with keyboard operation on these systems.
