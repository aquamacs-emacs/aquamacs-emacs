     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">4.2 What is the latest version of Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Version_002c-latest-120"></a><a name="index-Latest-version-of-Emacs-121"></a><a name="index-Development_002c-Emacs-122"></a><a name="index-Repository_002c-Emacs-123"></a><a name="index-Bazaar-repository_002c-Emacs-124"></a>
Aquamacs is based on GNU Emacs.

   <p>Emacs 23.2.50 is the current version as of this writing.  A version
number with two components (e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">22.1</span></samp>&rsquo;) indicates a released
version; three components indicate a development
version (e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">23.0.50</span></samp>&rsquo; is what will eventually become &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">23.1</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p>Emacs is under active development, hosted at
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/">Savannah</a>.  The source
code can be retrieved anonymously following the
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/bzr/?group=emacs">instructions</a>. 
The repository is GNU Bazaar.

   <p>Because Emacs undergoes many changes before a release, the version
number of a development version is not especially meaningful.  It is
better to refer to the date on which the sources were retrieved from the
development repository.  The development version is usually quite robust
for every-day use, but if stability is more important to you than the
latest features, you may want to stick to the releases.

   <p>The following sections list some of the major new features in the last
few Emacs releases.  For full details of the changes in any version of
Emacs, type <kbd>C-h C-n</kbd> (<kbd>M-x view-emacs-news</kbd>).  As of Emacs 22,
you can give this command a prefix argument to read about which features
were new in older versions.

   <p>Changes in Aquamacs can be found on the <a href="http://aquamacs.org">Aquamacs Web Site</a>
as well as in the Change Log included with the distributed DMG packet;
or type <kbd>M-x aquamacs-show-change-log</kbd>.
