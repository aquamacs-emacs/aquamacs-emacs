     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">8.5 What is the difference between Emacs and XEmacs (formerly Lucid Emacs)?</h3>

<p><a name="index-XEmacs-396"></a><a name="index-Difference-Emacs-and-XEmacs-397"></a><a name="index-Lucid-Emacs-398"></a><a name="index-Epoch-399"></a>
XEmacs is a branch version of Emacs.  It was first called Lucid Emacs,
and was initially derived from a prerelease version of Emacs 19.  In
this FAQ, we use the name &ldquo;Emacs&rdquo; only for the official version.

   <p>Emacs and XEmacs each come with Lisp packages that are lacking in the
other.  The two versions have some significant differences at the Lisp
programming level.  Their current features are roughly comparable,
though the support for some operating systems, character sets and
specific packages might be quite different.

   <p>Some XEmacs code has been contributed to Emacs, and we would like to
use other parts, but the earlier XEmacs maintainers did not always
keep track of the authors of contributed code, which makes it
impossible for the FSF to get copyright papers signed for that code. 
(The FSF requires these papers for all the code included in the Emacs
release, aside from generic C support packages that retain their
separate identity and are not integrated into the code of Emacs
proper.)

   <p>If you want to talk about these two versions and distinguish them,
please call them &ldquo;Emacs&rdquo; and &ldquo;XEmacs.&rdquo;  To contrast &ldquo;XEmacs&rdquo;
with &ldquo;GNU Emacs&rdquo; would be misleading, since XEmacs too has its
origin in the work of the GNU Project.  Terms such as &ldquo;Emacsen&rdquo; and
&ldquo;(X)Emacs&rdquo; are not wrong, but they are not very clear, so it
is better to write &ldquo;Emacs and XEmacs.&rdquo;
