     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">4.1 Where does the name &ldquo;Emacs&rdquo; come from?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Origin-of-the-term-_0060_0060Emacs_0027_0027-115"></a><a name="index-Emacs-name-origin-116"></a><a name="index-TECO-117"></a><a name="index-Original-version-of-Emacs-118"></a>
Emacs originally was an acronym for Editor MACroS.  RMS says he &ldquo;picked
the name Emacs because &lt;E&gt; was not in use as an abbreviation on ITS at
the time.&rdquo;  The first Emacs was a set of macros written in 1976 at MIT
by RMS for the editor TECO (Text Editor and COrrector, originally Tape
Editor and COrrector) under ITS (the Incompatible Timesharing System) on
a PDP-10.  RMS had already extended TECO with a &ldquo;real-time&rdquo;
full-screen mode with reprogrammable keys.  Emacs was started by
<a href="mailto:gls@east.sun.com">Guy Steele</a> as a project to unify the many
divergent TECO command sets and key bindings at MIT, and completed by
RMS.

   <p>Many people have said that TECO code looks a lot like line noise; you
can read more at <a href="news:alt.lang.teco">news:alt.lang.teco</a>.  Someone has written a TECO
implementation in Emacs Lisp (to find it, see <a href="Packages-that-do-not-come-with-Emacs.html#Packages-that-do-not-come-with-Emacs">Packages that do not come with Emacs</a>); it would be an interesting project to run the
original TECO Emacs inside of Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-Why-Emacs_003f-119"></a>For some not-so-serious alternative reasons for Emacs to have that
name, check out the file <samp><span class="file">etc/JOKES</span></samp> (see <a href="File_002dname-conventions.html#File_002dname-conventions">File-name conventions</a>).
