     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">6.11 Dired says, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">no file on this line</span></samp>&rsquo; when I try to do something.</h3>

<p><a name="index-Dired-does-not-see-a-file-369"></a>
Dired uses a regular expression to find the beginning of a file name. 
In a long Unix-style directory listing (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls -l</span></samp>&rsquo;), the file name
starts after the date.  The regexp has thus been written to look for the
date.  By default, it should understand dates and times regardless of
the language, but if your directory listing has an unusual format, Dired
may get confused.

   <p>There are two approaches to solving this.  The first one involves
setting things up so that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls -l</span></samp>&rsquo; outputs a more standard format. 
See your OS manual for more information.

   <p>The second approach involves changing the regular expression used by
dired, <code>directory-listing-before-filename-regexp</code>.
