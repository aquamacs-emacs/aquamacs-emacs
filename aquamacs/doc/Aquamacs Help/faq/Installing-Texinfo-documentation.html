     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">3.5 How do I install a piece of Texinfo documentation?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Texinfo-documentation_002c-installing-90"></a><a name="index-Installing-Texinfo-documentation-91"></a><a name="index-New-Texinfo-files_002c-installing-92"></a><a name="index-Documentation_002c-installing-new-Texinfo-files-93"></a><a name="index-Info-files_002c-how-to-install-94"></a>
Emacs releases come with pre-built Info files, and the normal install
process places them in the correct location.  This is true for most
applications that provide Info files.  The following section is only
relevant if you want to install extra Info files by hand.

   <p>First, you must turn the Texinfo source files into Info files.  You may
do this using the stand-alone <samp><span class="file">makeinfo</span></samp> program, available as part
of the Texinfo package at

   <p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/">http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/</a>

   <p>For information about the Texinfo format, read the Texinfo manual which
comes with the Texinfo package.  This manual also comes installed in
Info format, so you can read it from Emacs; type <kbd>C-h i m texinfo
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

<!-- FIXME is this a complete alternative? -->
<!-- Probably not, given that we require makeinfo to build Emacs. -->
   <p>Alternatively, you could use the Emacs command <kbd>M-x
texinfo-format-buffer</kbd>, after visiting the Texinfo source file of the
manual you want to convert.

   <p>Neither <code>texinfo-format-buffer</code> nor <samp><span class="file">makeinfo</span></samp> installs the
resulting Info files in Emacs's Info tree.  To install Info files,
perform these steps:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Move the files to the <samp><span class="file">info</span></samp> directory in the installed Emacs
distribution.  See <a href="File_002dname-conventions.html#File_002dname-conventions">File-name conventions</a>, if you don't know where that
is.

     <li>Run the <code>install-info</code> command, which is part of the Texinfo
distribution, to update the main Info directory menu, like this:

     <pre class="example">           install-info --info-dir=<var>dir-path</var> <var>dir-path</var>/<var>file</var>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">where <var>dir-path</var> is the full path to the directory where you copied
the produced Info file(s), and <var>file</var> is the name of the Info file
you produced and want to install.

     <p>If you don't have the <code>install-info</code> command installed, you can
edit the file <samp><span class="file">info/dir</span></samp> in the installed Emacs distribution, and
add a line for the top level node in the Info package that you are
installing.  Follow the examples already in this file.  The format is:

     <pre class="example">          * Topic: (relative-pathname).  Short description of topic.
</pre>
        </ol>

   <p>If you want to install Info files and you don't have the necessary
privileges, you have several options:

     <ul>
<li>Info files don't actually need to be installed before being used. 
You can use a prefix argument for the <code>info</code> command and specify
the name of the Info file in the minibuffer.  This goes to the node
named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo; in that file.  For example, to view a Info file named
<samp><var>info-file</var></samp> in your home directory, you can type this:

     <pre class="example">          <kbd>C-u C-h i ~/</kbd><var>info-file</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
</pre>
     <p>Alternatively, you can feed a file name to the <code>Info-goto-node</code>
command (invoked by pressing &lt;g&gt; in Info mode) by typing the name
of the file in parentheses, like this:

     <pre class="example">          <kbd>C-h i g (~/</kbd><var>info-file</var><kbd>) &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
</pre>
     <li>You can create your own Info directory.  You can tell Emacs where that
Info directory is by adding its pathname to the value of the variable
<code>Info-default-directory-list</code>.  For example, to use a private Info
directory which is a subdirectory of your home directory named <samp><span class="file">Info</span></samp>,
you could put this in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:

     <pre class="lisp">          (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "~/Info")
</pre>
     <p>You will need a top-level Info file named <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp> in this directory
which has everything the system <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp> file has in it, except it
should list only entries for Info files in that directory.  You might
not need it if (fortuitously) all files in this directory were
referenced by other <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp> files.  The node lists from all
<samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp> files in <code>Info-default-directory-list</code> are merged by the
Info system.

   </ul>
