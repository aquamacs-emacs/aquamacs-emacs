     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">2.5 Where should I report bugs and other problems with Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Bug-reporting-54"></a><a name="index-Good-bug-reports-55"></a><a name="index-How-to-submit-a-bug-report-56"></a><a name="index-Reporting-bugs-57"></a>
The correct way to report Emacs bugs is to use the command
<kbd>M-x report-emacs-bug</kbd>.  It sets up a mail buffer with the
essential information and the correct e-mail address, which is
<a href="mailto:bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org">bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org</a> for the released versions of Emacs. 
Anything sent to <a href="mailto:bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org">bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org</a> also appears in the
newsgroup <a href="news:gnu.emacs.bug">news:gnu.emacs.bug</a>, but please use e-mail instead of
news to submit the bug report.  This ensures a reliable return address
so you can be contacted for further details.

   <p>Be sure to read the &ldquo;Bugs&rdquo; section of the Emacs manual before reporting
a bug!  The manual describes in detail how to submit a useful bug
report (see <a href="../emacs/Bugs.html#Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a>). 
(See <a href="Emacs-manual.html#Emacs-manual">Emacs manual</a>, if you don't know how to read the manual.)

   <p>RMS says:

   <blockquote>
Sending bug reports to <a href="mailto:help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org">help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org</a> (which has the
effect of posting on <a href="news:gnu.emacs.help">news:gnu.emacs.help</a>) is undesirable because
it takes the time of an unnecessarily large group of people, most of
whom are just users and have no idea how to fix these problem. 
<a href="mailto:bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org">bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org</a> reaches a much smaller group of people
who are more likely to know what to do and have expressed a wish to
receive more messages about Emacs than the others. 
</blockquote>

   <p>RMS says it is sometimes fine to post to <a href="news:gnu.emacs.help">news:gnu.emacs.help</a>:

   <blockquote>
If you have reported a bug and you don't hear about a possible fix,
then after a suitable delay (such as a week) it is okay to post on
<code>gnu.emacs.help</code> asking if anyone can help you. 
</blockquote>

   <p>If you are unsure whether you have found a bug, consider the following
non-exhaustive list, courtesy of RMS:

   <blockquote>
If Emacs crashes, that is a bug.  If Emacs gets compilation errors
while building, that is a bug.  If Emacs crashes while building, that
is a bug.  If Lisp code does not do what the documentation says it
does, that is a bug.
