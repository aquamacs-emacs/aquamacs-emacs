     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">6.10 Are there any security risks in Emacs?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Security-with-Emacs-364"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bmovemail_007d-and-security-365"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfile_002dlocal_002dvariable_007d-and-security-366"></a><a name="index-Synthetic-X-events-and-security-367"></a><a name="index-X-events-and-security-368"></a>
     <ul>
<li>The <samp><span class="file">movemail</span></samp> incident.  (No, this is not a risk.)

     <p>In his book <cite>The Cuckoo's Egg</cite>, Cliff Stoll describes this in
chapter 4.  The site at LBL had installed the <samp><span class="file">/etc/movemail</span></samp>
program setuid root.  (As of version 19, <samp><span class="file">movemail</span></samp> is in your
architecture-specific directory; type <kbd>C-h v exec-directory
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to see what it is.)  Since <code>movemail</code> had not been
designed for this situation, a security hole was created and users could
get root privileges.

     <p><code>movemail</code> has since been changed so that this security hole will
not exist, even if it is installed setuid root.  However,
<code>movemail</code> no longer needs to be installed setuid root, which
should eliminate this particular risk.

     <p>We have heard unverified reports that the 1988 Internet worm took
advantage of this configuration problem.

     <li>The <code>file-local-variable</code> feature.  (Yes, a risk, but easy to
change.)

     <p>There is an Emacs feature that allows the setting of local values for
variables when editing a file by including specially formatted text near
the end of the file.  This feature also includes the ability to have
arbitrary Emacs Lisp code evaluated when the file is visited. 
Obviously, there is a potential for Trojan horses to exploit this
feature.

     <p>As of Emacs 22, Emacs has a list of local variables that are known to
be safe to set.  If a file tries to set any variable outside this
list, it asks the user to confirm whether the variables should be set. 
You can also tell Emacs whether to allow the evaluation of Emacs Lisp
code found at the bottom of files by setting the variable
<code>enable-local-eval</code>.

     <p>For more information, see <a href="../emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>.

     <li>Synthetic X events.  (Yes, a risk; use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</span></samp>&rsquo; or
better.)

     <p>Emacs accepts synthetic X events generated by the <code>SendEvent</code>
request as though they were regular events.  As a result, if you are
using the trivial host-based authentication, other users who can open X
connections to your X workstation can make your Emacs process do
anything, including run other processes with your privileges.

     <p>The only fix for this is to prevent other users from being able to open
X connections.  The standard way to prevent this is to use a real
authentication mechanism, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If using
the <code>xauth</code> program has any effect, then you are probably using
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Your site may be using a superior
authentication method; ask your system administrator.

     <p>If real authentication is not a possibility, you may be satisfied by
just allowing hosts access for brief intervals while you start your X
programs, then removing the access.  This reduces the risk somewhat by
narrowing the time window when hostile users would have access, but
<em>does not eliminate the risk</em>.

     <p>On most computers running Unix and X, you enable and disable
access using the <code>xhost</code> command.  To allow all hosts access to
your X server, use

     <pre class="example">          xhost +
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">at the shell prompt, which (on an HP machine, at least) produces the
following message:

     <pre class="example">          access control disabled, clients can connect from any host
</pre>
     <p>To deny all hosts access to your X server (except those explicitly
allowed by name), use

     <pre class="example">          xhost -
</pre>
     <p>On the test HP computer, this command generated the following message:

     <pre class="example">          access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect
</pre>
     </ul>

   </body></html>
