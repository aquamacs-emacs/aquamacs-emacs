     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">2.2 What is the real legal meaning of the GNU copyleft?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Copyleft_002c-real-meaning-of-41"></a><a name="index-GPL_002c-real-meaning-of-42"></a><a name="index-General-Public-License_002c-real-meaning-of-43"></a><a name="index-Discussion-of-the-GPL-44"></a>
The real legal meaning of the GNU General Public License (copyleft) will
only be known if and when a judge rules on its validity and scope. 
There has never been a copyright infringement case involving the GPL to
set any precedents.  Although legal actions have been brought against
companies for violating the terms of the GPL, so far all have been
settled out of court (in favour of the plaintiffs).  Please take any
discussion regarding this issue to the newsgroup
<a href="news:gnu.misc.discuss">news:gnu.misc.discuss</a>, which was created to hold the extensive
flame wars on the subject.

   <blockquote>
The legal meaning of the GNU copyleft is less important than the spirit,
which is that Emacs is a free software project and that work pertaining
to Emacs should also be free software.  &ldquo;Free&rdquo; means that all users
have the freedom to study, share, change and improve Emacs.  To make
sure everyone has this freedom, pass along source code when you
distribute any version of Emacs or a related program, and give the
recipients the same freedom that you enjoyed.
