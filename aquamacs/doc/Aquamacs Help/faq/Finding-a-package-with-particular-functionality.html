     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">8.2 How do I find a Emacs Lisp package that does XXX?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Package_002c-finding-381"></a><a name="index-Finding-an-Emacs-Lisp-package-382"></a><a name="index-Functionality_002c-finding-a-particular-package-383"></a>
First of all, you should check to make sure that the package isn't
already available.  For example, typing <kbd>M-x apropos &lt;RET&gt;
wordstar &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> lists all functions and variables containing the
string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wordstar</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>It is also possible that the package is on your system, but has not been
loaded.  To see which packages are available for loading, look through
your computer's lisp directory (see <a href="File_002dname-conventions.html#File_002dname-conventions">File-name conventions</a>).  The Lisp
source to most packages contains a short description of how they
should be loaded, invoked, and configured&mdash;so before you use or
modify a Lisp package, see if the author has provided any hints in the
source code.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-h p</kbd> (<code>finder-by-keyword</code>) allows you to browse
the constituent Emacs packages.

   <p>For advice on how to find extra packages that are not part of Emacs,
see <a href="Packages-that-do-not-come-with-Emacs.html#Packages-that-do-not-come-with-Emacs">Packages that do not come with Emacs</a>.
