     This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
     answers (``FAQ'') may be translated into other languages,
     transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
     and updated with new information.

     The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
     the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
     an approved translation, information on who is currently
     maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
     e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
     the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

     The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
     except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
     unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.

     [This version has been heavily edited since it was included in the
     Emacs distribution.]

<h3 class="section">10.2 Why does Emacs say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Key sequence XXX uses invalid prefix characters</span></samp>&rsquo;?</h3>

<p><a name="index-Prefix-characters_002c-invalid-447"></a><a name="index-Invalid-prefix-characters-448"></a><a name="index-Misspecified-key-sequences-449"></a>
Usually, one of two things has happened.  In one case, the control
character in the key sequence has been misspecified (e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-f</span></samp>&rsquo;
used instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\C-f</span></samp>&rsquo; within a Lisp expression).  In the other
case, a <dfn>prefix key</dfn> in the keystroke sequence you were trying to bind
was already bound as a <dfn>complete key</dfn>.  Historically, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ESC [</span></samp>&rsquo;
prefix was usually the problem, in which case you should evaluate either
of these forms before attempting to bind the key sequence:

<pre class="lisp">     (global-unset-key [?\e ?[])  ;;  or
     (global-unset-key "\e[")
</pre>
   </body></html>
