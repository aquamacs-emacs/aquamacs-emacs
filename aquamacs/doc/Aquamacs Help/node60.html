Changes--0.9.7</A>
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><I>S</I>ummary: New functions: Mac-style printing, Export to PDF and
	HTML, Spelling suggestions, New buffer in mode / change major mode
	menus, a context menu (right mouse click), speed improvements,
	nXML and AUCTeX included text display improved (international
	characters and proportional fonts), "wrong command-p" bug fixed
	and much more.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Printing: Aquamacs now supports full What-you-see-is-what-
	you-get printing. Choose 'Preview and Print' from the File menu,
	and the current buffer (or the current region, if one is marked)
	is typeset using the color theme and the syntax coloring that is
	active. You can then preview or print it with the standard Mac OS
	X printing dialogs, selecting a standard Mac printer. (Output to
	US Letter format only at this point. Sorry!)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Export to PDF and HTML: The current buffer (or a region if
	selected) can now be exported to a PDF or HTML file. Syntax
	coloring (and the chosen color theme except for the background
	color) are respected.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>LaTeX: Aquamacs now comes with the latest version of
	AUCTeX, which will allow you to most comfortably edit LaTeX source
	code and even preview some of the results (e.g. formulas) directly
	in your document.  No need to install an additional AUCTeX
	package. 	AUCTeX already works out-of-the box.

<P>
It is recommended that you remove any previous installations of
	AUCTeX. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>nXML: Edit XML code more comfortably with the included
	nxml-mode. It validates the document as you type. If you don't
	like the mode, the following in your Preferences.el file will
	bring the old XML mode back:

<P>
<PRE> 	
(assq-set-equal "&lt;\\?xml " 'xml-mode 
                           'magic-mode-alist)
</PRE>

<P>
Suggestion from Tim Bray.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Speed: Aquamacs is a little faster now when opening new frames,
	when frame appearance styles have been defined. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Right-Mouse-clicks in text now bring up a context menu which
	allows you to copy/paste, search the word under the mouse in
	Google or look it up in the system dictionary and switch the buffer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Control-Mouse-click is always mapped to mouse-3 (right mouse
	button) now so Apple mouse and laptop users will consistently get the same
	functionality. To do mouse-2, just hold down the Command key while
	clicking. (This does mouse-yank-at-click, a useful functionality that you
	might be used to from Linux / X11 machines!)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Alt-Mouse-click&amp;drag allows you to select a secondary
	selection. (This used to be on Command-mouse-1-drag.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Spelling correction (flyspell) will make suggestions upon
	right-clicking on a misspelled word.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fonts/Display: Aquamacs Emacs can now display an even wider
	range of characters with any font available on OS X. Some
	characters will look nicer.  
	Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Text Display: Aquamacs now displays text in variable-width fonts
	with much better letter-spacing. It'll look like in other OS X
	apps, and reading and editing long texts is much more fun now.
	Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Navigation in wrapped lines (not word wrap) is easier now: arrow
	keys will jump to the next visual line, not to the next
	buffer/file line. Also, navigation is visual now for variable
	width fonts like Lucida: jumping up or down moves to roughly the
	same place in the adjacent line going after what's displayed on
	the screen rather than counting characters (jumping to the same
	row number in the next line).  If you don't like the behavior, you
	can turn it off with this code in your Preferences.el / .emacs
	file:

<P>
<PRE> 
(define-key osx-key-mode-map [remap previous-line]
            'previous-line)

(define-key osx-key-mode-map [remap next-line] 
            'next-line)
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Scrolling and setting the point with the mouse has improved:
	`scroll-margin' defaults to 0 now, so scrolling won't happen until
	you've reached the first or last line in the window - except when
	you use the cursor up/down keys (and osx-key-mode is on). Then,
	scrolling takes place a few lines before you reach the
	boundary. You can configure this via Aquamacs' customization
	variable `visual-scroll-margin'.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Command-{ comments the line or the region (in programming modes)
</LI>
<LI>Command-} uncomments the line or the region (in programming
	modes) 
</LI>
<LI>Command-' comments or uncomments (toggling) the line or
	the region (in programming modes)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Command-Delete kills (erases) the rest of the current
	line. (Command-Backspace kills the whole line.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Filenames with spaces can now be entered without hassle.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Modifier-Key configuration: Several previously deprecated
	variables have been removed: `mac-reverse-ctrl-meta' and
	'mac-command-key-is-meta'. Use the much simpler, yet
	equally powerful variables `mac-command-modifier', 
	`mac-option-modifier', `mac-control-modifier' and 
	`mac-function-modifier' (experimental) instead.
	Additionally, `mac-pass-option-to-system' is deprecated now:
	instead, set `mac-option-modifier' to nil to reach the same
	effect. The use of the Option menu is recommended. 

<P>
To set the Apple key to Meta (not recommended), add this to your
	Preferences.el file:

<P>
tt (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fn-key can act as Meta. If you have an Fn key on your laptop,
	you can use it as Meta key now. Add this to your Preferences.el
	file:

<P>
<TT>(setq mac-function-modifier 'meta)</TT>

<P>
Note that support of the Fn key is experimental. Rare
	combinations may fail on non-English keyboard layouts,
	and some keys will not work correctly in combination with Fn and Shift.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Modifier keys such as Command or Shift show up correctly in the
	shortcuts (menu)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>New-Buffer menu contains many more modes now, such as modes for
	Fortran, ObjectiveC, C++, PHP, CSS, JavaScript...
	You can add your own in the customization variable
	`aquamacs-known-major-modes'. The menu is updated automatically.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change-Buffer-Mode menu (in File menu) allows to change the mode
	of the current buffer to something hopefully more useful.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Recently used major modes are now displayed in New-Buffer and
	Change-Buffer-Mode menus .

<P>
</LI>
<LI>M-w (kill-ring-save) will now deactivate the mark after saving
	the region, that is deselect the region, just like on standard
	Emacs. Apple-C will not deselect the region, just like it's done
	on the Mac. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Run executables from within Emacs that lie in your PATH as
        set in shell init files. Aquamacs will set `exec-path'
        automatically from PATH.  We don't add paths to exec-path any
        more (except one default tetex path for AUCTeX).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Questions like "Save to file before closing?" will be asked with
	a proper dialog and not with a menu appearing out of nothing - if
	the last action was carried out with the mouse.           

<P>
Thanks to CarbonEmacsJP project for part of this.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Info mode: C-h i  will bring up not only up-to-date info nodes
	for Emacs, but also info on installed packages on the system.
 	(unless you have an INFOPATH environment variable set)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Mode-specific styles: With a new menu function, you can now
	apply the style assigned to some other mode, effectively copying
	it over.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Mode-specific styles are not applied any more for the major-mode
	of buffers shown in temporary windows inside frames such as the
</LI>
<LI>Completions* buffer. This prevents ugly font-switching etc. for
	the whole frame when just a small window is opened inside the frame.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>New Packages: findr, htmlize, ruby's friends, auctex
 	(latex-mode), nxml-mode, matlab-mode, javascript-mode, 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Notable Updated external packages: ruby-mode, ruby-*, carbon-font

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Apple/Command key is now called 'A-' internally because it looks
	like "Apple-" (while it's really the otherwise unused "Alt" key). 
	It used to be "H-" (or: hyper), so change your configuration code
	in case you've defined your own shortcuts.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>One-Buffer-One-Frame is a minor mode now (called
	one-buffer-one-frame-mode). Use the Options menu (and Save
	Options) to turn it on/off, as before.
	In this minor mode, you have some additional key bindings now:

<P>
C-x B, C-x C-B, C-x S-left, C-x S-right
	they all do the same as their corresponding functions without the
	Shift key, but they will show the buffer that they are switching
	to in the same window, even though one-buffer-one-frame-mode is on.

<P>
The mode has been revised to open fewer extra windows when their
	content is related to a specific frame - for example version
	control checkin comments.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Manual: The Emacs Manual that comes with Aquamacs (as an Apple
	Help document) has been updated to reflect the basis of Aquamacs,
	namely the upcoming Emacs 22.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Command-p-Bugfix: For some users, Emacs locked up at random
	times, showing a message like (wrong command-p ...) in the echo
	area of a frame on every input. This bug in the underlying GNU
	Emacs should be fixed now.
	Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu, Richard Stallman, et al.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Aquamacs now correctly remembers the positions of frames
	with specific files, so they open again on the same screen
	position if the file is re-loaded (in the same session, or after
	"Save Options" in the next session).
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Bookmarks did not work with `one-buffer-one-frame'
	turned on.  
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Some Show/Hide options weren't saved by
	"Save Options".
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: links from describe-variable/function help buffers to the 
	source files are correct now for the Aquamacs-specific objects
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Aquamacs works fine now on systems where, in the default
	shell (e.g. via .bash profile), functions have been defined and
	exported.
	Reported by Terry Jones 
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: RefTeX mode does't give constant audio signals (errors) 
	any more in certain situations
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Allout mode should work again (saving files)
	Reported by Gerry Brush
	Patch by Ken Mannheimer
