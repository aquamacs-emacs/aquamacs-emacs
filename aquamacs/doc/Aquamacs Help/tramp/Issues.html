<h2 class="chapter">10 Debatable Issues and What Was Decided</h2>

     <ul>
<li>The uuencode method does not always work.

     <p>Due to the design of <span class="sc">tramp</span>, the encoding and decoding programs
need to read from stdin and write to stdout.  On some systems,
<samp><span class="command">uudecode -o -</span></samp> will read stdin and write the decoded file to
stdout, on other systems <samp><span class="command">uudecode -p</span></samp> does the same thing. 
But some systems have uudecode implementations which cannot do this at
all&mdash;it is not possible to call these uudecode implementations with
suitable parameters so that they write to stdout.

     <p>Of course, this could be circumvented: the <code>begin foo 644</code> line
could be rewritten to put in some temporary file name, then
<samp><span class="command">uudecode</span></samp> could be called, then the temp file could be
printed and deleted.

     <p>But I have decided that this is too fragile to reliably work, so on some
systems you'll have to do without the uuencode methods.

     <li>The <span class="sc">tramp</span> filename syntax differs between GNU Emacs and XEmacs.

     <p>The GNU Emacs maintainers wish to use a unified filename syntax for
Ange-FTP and <span class="sc">tramp</span> so that users don't have to learn a new
syntax.  It is sufficient to learn some extensions to the old syntax.

     <p>For the XEmacs maintainers, the problems caused from using a unified
filename syntax are greater than the gains.  The XEmacs package system
uses EFS for downloading new packages.  So, obviously, EFS has to be
installed from the start.  If the filenames were unified, <span class="sc">tramp</span>
would have to be installed from the start, too.

</ul>
