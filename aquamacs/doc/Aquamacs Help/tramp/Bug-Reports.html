<h2 class="chapter">6 Reporting Bugs and Problems</h2>

<p><a name="index-bug-reports-192"></a>
Bugs and problems with <span class="sc">tramp</span> are actively worked on by the
development team.  Feature requests and suggestions are also more than
welcome.

   <p>The <span class="sc">tramp</span> mailing list is a great place to get information on
working with <span class="sc">tramp</span>, solving problems and general discussion
and advice on topics relating to the package.  It is moderated so
non-subscribers can post but messages will be delayed, possibly up to
48 hours (or longer in case of holidays), until the moderator approves
your message.

   <p>The mailing list is at <a href="mailto:tramp-devel@gnu.org">tramp-devel@gnu.org</a>.  Messages sent to
this address go to all the subscribers.  This is <em>not</em> the address
to send subscription requests to.

   <p>Subscribing to the list is performed via
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/tramp-devel/">the <span class="sc">tramp</span> Mail Subscription Page</a>.

   <p><a name="index-tramp_002dbug-193"></a>To report a bug in <span class="sc">tramp</span>, you should execute <kbd>M-x
tramp-bug</kbd>.  This will automatically generate a buffer with the details
of your system and <span class="sc">tramp</span> version.

   <p>When submitting a bug report, please try to describe in excruciating
detail the steps required to reproduce the problem, the setup of the
remote machine and any special conditions that exist.  You should also
check that your problem is not described already in See <a href="Frequently-Asked-Questions.html#Frequently-Asked-Questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.

   <p>If you can identify a minimal test case that reproduces the problem,
include that with your bug report.  This will make it much easier for
the development team to analyze and correct the problem.

   <p>Before reporting the bug, you should set the verbosity level to 6
(see <a href="Traces-and-Profiles.html#Traces-and-Profiles">Traces</a>) in the <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file and
repeat the bug.  Then, include the contents of the <samp><span class="file">*tramp/foo*</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">*debug tramp/foo*</span></samp> buffers in your bug report.  A verbosity
level greater than 6 will produce a very huge debug buffer, which is
mostly not necessary for the analysis.

   <p>Please be aware that, with a verbosity level of 6 or greater, the
contents of files and directories will be included in the debug
buffer.  Passwords you've typed will never be included there.
