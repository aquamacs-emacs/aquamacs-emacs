<h2 class="chapter">1 An overview of <span class="sc">tramp</span></h2>

<p><a name="index-overview-1"></a>
After the installation of <span class="sc">tramp</span> into your GNU Emacs, you
will be able to access files on remote machines as though they were
local.  Access to the remote file system for editing files, version
control, and <code>dired</code> are transparently enabled.

   <p>Your access to the remote machine can be with the <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">rlogin</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp> programs or with any similar
connection method.  This connection must pass <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
successfully to be usable but need not be 8-bit clean.

   <p>The package provides support for <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> connections out of the
box, one of the more common uses of the package.  This allows
relatively secure access to machines, especially if <samp><span class="command">ftp</span></samp>
access is disabled.

   <p>Under Windows, <span class="sc">tramp</span> is integrated with the PuTTY package,
using the <samp><span class="command">plink</span></samp> program.

   <p>The majority of activity carried out by <span class="sc">tramp</span> requires only that
the remote login is possible and is carried out at the terminal.  In
order to access remote files <span class="sc">tramp</span> needs to transfer their content
to the local machine temporarily.

   <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> can transfer files between the machines in a variety of ways. 
The details are easy to select, depending on your needs and the
machines in question.

   <p>The fastest transfer methods for large files rely on a remote file
transfer package such as <samp><span class="command">rcp</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp>
or (under Windows) <samp><span class="command">pscp</span></samp>.

   <p>If the remote copy methods are not suitable for you, <span class="sc">tramp</span> also
supports the use of encoded transfers directly through the shell. 
This requires that the <samp><span class="command">mimencode</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">uuencode</span></samp> tools
are available on the remote machine.  These methods are generally
faster for small files.

   <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> is still under active development and any problems you encounter,
trivial or major, should be reported to the <span class="sc">tramp</span> developers. 
See <a href="Bug-Reports.html#Bug-Reports">Bug Reports</a>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Behind the scenes</h5>

<p><a name="index-behind-the-scenes-2"></a><a name="index-details-of-operation-3"></a><a name="index-how-it-works-4"></a>
This section tries to explain what goes on behind the scenes when you
access a remote file through <span class="sc">tramp</span>.

   <p>Suppose you type <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> and enter part of an <span class="sc">tramp</span> file name,
then hit <kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> for completion.  Suppose further that this is
the first time that <span class="sc">tramp</span> is invoked for the host in question.  Here's
what happens:

     <ul>
<li><span class="sc">tramp</span> discovers that it needs a connection to the host.  So it
invokes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">telnet </span><var>host</var></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rsh </span><var>host</var><span class="samp"> -l
</span><var>user</var></samp>&rsquo; or a similar tool to connect to the remote host. 
Communication with this process happens through an
GNU Emacs buffer, that is, the output from the remote end
goes into a buffer.

     <li>The remote host may prompt for a login name (for <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp>). 
The login name is given in the file name, so <span class="sc">tramp</span> sends the
login name and a newline.

     <li>The remote host may prompt for a password or pass phrase (for
<samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp> or for <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp> after sending the login name). 
<span class="sc">tramp</span> displays the prompt in the minibuffer, asking you for the
password or pass phrase.

     <p>You enter the password or pass phrase.  <span class="sc">tramp</span> sends it to the remote
host, followed by a newline.

     <li><span class="sc">tramp</span> now waits for the shell prompt or for a message that the login
failed.

     <p>If <span class="sc">tramp</span> sees neither of them after a certain period of time
(a minute, say), then it issues an error message saying that it
couldn't find the remote shell prompt and shows you what the remote
host has sent.

     <p>If <span class="sc">tramp</span> sees a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">login failed</span></samp>&rsquo; message, it tells you so,
aborts the login attempt and allows you to try again.

     <li>Suppose that the login was successful and <span class="sc">tramp</span> sees the shell prompt
from the remote host.  Now <span class="sc">tramp</span> invokes <samp><span class="command">/bin/sh</span></samp> because
Bourne shells and C shells have different command
syntaxes.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

     <p>After the Bourne shell has come up, <span class="sc">tramp</span> sends a few commands to
ensure a good working environment.  It turns off echoing, it sets the
shell prompt, and a few other things.

     <li>Now the remote shell is up and it good working order.  Remember, what
was supposed to happen is that <span class="sc">tramp</span> tries to find out what files exist
on the remote host so that it can do filename completion.

     <p>So, <span class="sc">tramp</span> basically issues <samp><span class="command">cd</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> commands and
also sometimes <samp><span class="command">echo</span></samp> with globbing.  Another command that is
often used is <samp><span class="command">test</span></samp> to find out whether a file is writable or a
directory or the like.  The output of each command is parsed for the
necessary operation.

     <li>Suppose you are finished with filename completion, have entered <kbd>C-x
C-f</kbd>, a full file name and hit <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  Now comes the time to
transfer the file contents from the remote host to the local host so
that you can edit them.

     <p>See above for an explanation of how <span class="sc">tramp</span> transfers the file contents.

     <p>For inline transfers, <span class="sc">tramp</span> issues a command like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mimencode -b
/path/to/remote/file</span></samp>&rsquo;, waits until the output has accumulated in the
buffer that's used for communication, then decodes that output to
produce the file contents.

     <p>For external transfers, <span class="sc">tramp</span> issues a command like the
following:
     <pre class="example">          rcp user@host:/path/to/remote/file /tmp/tramp.4711
</pre>
     <p>It then reads the local temporary file <samp><span class="file">/tmp/tramp.4711</span></samp> into a
buffer and deletes the temporary file.

     <li>You now edit the buffer contents, blithely unaware of what has happened
behind the scenes.  (Unless you have read this section, that is.)  When
you are finished, you type <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> to save the buffer.

     <li>Again, <span class="sc">tramp</span> transfers the file contents to the remote host
either inline or external.  This is the reverse of what happens when
reading the file. 
</ul>

   <p>I hope this has provided you with a basic overview of what happens
behind the scenes when you open a file with <span class="sc">tramp</span>.
