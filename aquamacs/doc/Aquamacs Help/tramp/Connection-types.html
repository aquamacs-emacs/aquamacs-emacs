<h3 class="section">4.1 Types of connections made to remote machines.</h3>

<p><a name="index-connection-types_002c-overview-10"></a>
There are two basic types of transfer methods, each with its own
advantages and limitations.  Both types of connection make use of a
remote shell access program such as <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp> to connect to the remote machine.

   <p>This connection is used to perform many of the operations that <span class="sc">tramp</span>
requires to make the remote file system transparently accessible from
the local machine.  It is only when visiting files that the methods
differ.

   <p><a name="index-inline-methods-11"></a><a name="index-external-methods-12"></a><a name="index-methods_002c-inline-13"></a><a name="index-methods_002c-external-14"></a>Loading or saving a remote file requires that the content of the file
be transfered between the two machines.  The content of the file can
be transfered using one of two methods: the <dfn>inline method</dfn> over
the same connection used to log in to the remote machine, or the
<dfn>external method</dfn> through another connection using a remote copy
program such as <samp><span class="command">rcp</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp>.

   <p>The performance of the external methods is generally better than that
of the inline methods, at least for large files.  This is caused by
the need to encode and decode the data when transferring inline.

   <p>The one exception to this rule are the <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp> based transfer
methods.  While these methods do see better performance when actually
transferring files, the overhead of the cryptographic negotiation at
startup may drown out the improvement in file transfer times.

   <p>External methods should be configured such a way that they don't
require a password (with <samp><span class="command">ssh-agent</span></samp>, or such alike).  Modern
<samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp> implementations offer options to reuse existing
<samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> connections, see method <samp><span class="command">scpc</span></samp>.  If it isn't
possible, you should consider <a href="Password-handling.html#Password-handling">Password handling</a>, otherwise you
will be prompted for a password every copy action.
