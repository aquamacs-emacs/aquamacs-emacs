<h2 class="chapter">3 History of <span class="sc">tramp</span></h2>

<p><a name="index-history-6"></a><a name="index-development-history-7"></a>
Development was started end of November 1998.  The package was called
<samp><span class="file">rssh.el</span></samp>, back then.  It only provided one method to access a
file, using <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> to log in to a remote host and using
<samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp> to transfer the file contents.  After a while, the name
was changed to <samp><span class="file">rcp.el</span></samp>, and now it's <span class="sc">tramp</span>.  Along the way,
many more methods for getting a remote shell and for transferring the
file contents were added.  Support for VC was added.

   <p>After that, there were added the multi-hop methods in April 2000 and
the unification of <span class="sc">tramp</span> and Ange-FTP filenames in July 2002. 
In July 2004, multi-hop methods have been replaced by proxy hosts. 
Running commands on remote hosts was introduced in December 2005. 
Support of gateways exists since April 2007. 
GVFS integration started in February 2009. 
Storing files into IMAP mailboxes has been added in September 2009.

   <p>In December 2001, <span class="sc">tramp</span> has been added to the XEmacs package
repository.  Being part of the GNU Emacs repository happened in June
2002, the first release including <span class="sc">tramp</span> was GNU Emacs 22.1.

   <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> is also a GNU/Linux Debian package since February 2001.
