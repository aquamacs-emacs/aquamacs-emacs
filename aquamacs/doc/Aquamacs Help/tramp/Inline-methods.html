<h3 class="section">4.2 Inline methods</h3>

<p><a name="index-inline-methods-15"></a><a name="index-methods_002c-inline-16"></a>
The inline methods in <span class="sc">tramp</span> are quite powerful and can work in
situations where you cannot use an external transfer program to connect. 
Inline methods are the only methods that work when connecting to the
remote machine via telnet.  (There are also strange inline methods which
allow you to transfer files between <em>user identities</em> rather than
hosts, see below.)

   <p>These methods depend on the existence of a suitable encoding and
decoding command on remote machine.  Locally, <span class="sc">tramp</span> may be able to
use features of GNU Emacs to decode and encode the files or
it may require access to external commands to perform that task.

   <p><a name="index-uuencode-17"></a><a name="index-mimencode-18"></a><a name="index-base_002d64-encoding-19"></a><span class="sc">tramp</span> checks the availability and usability of commands like
<samp><span class="command">mimencode</span></samp> (part of the <samp><span class="command">metamail</span></samp> package) or
<samp><span class="command">uuencode</span></samp> on the remote host.  The first reliable command
will be used.  The search path can be customized, see <a href="Remote-Programs.html#Remote-Programs">Remote Programs</a>.

   <p>If both commands aren't available on the remote host, <span class="sc">tramp</span>
transfers a small piece of Perl code to the remote host, and tries to
apply it for encoding and decoding.

   <p>The variable <var>tramp-inline-compress-start-size</var> controls, whether
a file shall be compressed before encoding.  This could increase
transfer speed for large text files.

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">rsh</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-rsh-20"></a><a name="index-rsh-method-21"></a>
Connect to the remote host with <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp>.  Due to the unsecure
connection it is recommended for very local host topology only.

     <p>On operating systems which provide the command <samp><span class="command">remsh</span></samp> instead
of <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp>, you can use the method <samp><span class="option">remsh</span></samp>.  This is true
for HP-UX or Cray UNICOS, for example.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-ssh-22"></a><a name="index-ssh-method-23"></a>
Connect to the remote host with <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>.  This is identical to
the previous option except that the <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> package is used,
making the connection more secure.

     <p>There are also two variants, <samp><span class="option">ssh1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">ssh2</span></samp>, that
call &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh -1</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh -2</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively.  This way, you can
explicitly select whether you want to use the SSH protocol version 1
or 2 to connect to the remote host.  (You can also specify in
<samp><span class="file">~/.ssh/config</span></samp>, the SSH configuration file, which protocol
should be used, and use the regular <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp> method.)

     <p>Two other variants, <samp><span class="option">ssh1_old</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">ssh2_old</span></samp>, use the
<samp><span class="command">ssh1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ssh2</span></samp> commands explicitly.  If you don't
know what these are, you do not need these options.

     <p>All the methods based on <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> have an additional feature: you
can specify a host name which looks like <samp><span class="file">host#42</span></samp> (the real host
name, then a hash sign, then a port number).  This means to connect to
the given host but to also pass <code>-p 42</code> as arguments to the
<samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> command.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">telnet</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-telnet-24"></a><a name="index-telnet-method-25"></a>
Connect to the remote host with <samp><span class="command">telnet</span></samp>.  This is as unsecure
as the <samp><span class="option">rsh</span></samp> method.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">su</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-su-26"></a><a name="index-su-method-27"></a>
This method does not connect to a remote host at all, rather it uses
the <samp><span class="command">su</span></samp> program to allow you to edit files as another user. 
That means, the specified host name in the file name must be either
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">localhost</span></samp>&rsquo; or the host name as returned by the function
<samp><span class="command">(system-name)</span></samp>.  For an exception of this rule see
<a href="Multi_002dhops.html#Multi_002dhops">Multi-hops</a>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">sudo</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-sudo-28"></a><a name="index-sudo-method-29"></a>
This is similar to the <samp><span class="option">su</span></samp> method, but it uses <samp><span class="command">sudo</span></samp>
rather than <samp><span class="command">su</span></samp> to become a different user.

     <p>Note that <samp><span class="command">sudo</span></samp> must be configured to allow you to start a
shell as the user.  It would be nice if it was sufficient if
<samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">mimencode</span></samp> were allowed, but that is not
easy to implement, so I haven't got around to it, yet.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">sshx</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-sshx-30"></a><a name="index-sshx-method-31"></a>
As you would expect, this is similar to <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp>, only a little
different.  Whereas <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp> opens a normal interactive shell on
the remote host, this option uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh -t -t </span><var>host</var><span class="samp"> -l
</span><var>user</var><span class="samp"> /bin/sh</span></samp>&rsquo; to open a connection.  This is useful for users
where the normal login shell is set up to ask them a number of
questions when logging in.  This procedure avoids these questions, and
just gives <span class="sc">tramp</span> a more-or-less `standard' login shell to work
with.

     <p>Note that this procedure does not eliminate questions asked by
<samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> itself.  For example, <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> might ask &ldquo;Are you
sure you want to continue connecting?&rdquo; if the host key of the remote
host is not known.  <span class="sc">tramp</span> does not know how to deal with such a
question (yet), therefore you will need to make sure that you can log
in without such questions.

     <p>This is also useful for Windows users where <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>, when
invoked from an GNU Emacs buffer, tells them that it is not
allocating a pseudo tty.  When this happens, the login shell is wont
to not print any shell prompt, which confuses <span class="sc">tramp</span> mightily.

     <p>This supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">krlogin</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-krlogin-32"></a><a name="index-krlogin-method-33"></a><a name="index-Kerberos-_0028with-krlogin-method_0029-34"></a>
This method is also similar to <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp>.  It only uses the
<samp><span class="command">krlogin -x</span></samp> command to log in to the remote host.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">plink</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-plink-35"></a><a name="index-plink-method-36"></a>
This method is mostly interesting for Windows users using the PuTTY
implementation of SSH.  It uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plink -ssh</span></samp>&rsquo; to log in to the
remote host.

     <p>This supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-P</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.

     <p>Additionally, the methods <samp><span class="option">plink1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">plink2</span></samp> are
provided, which call &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plink -1 -ssh</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plink -2 -ssh</span></samp>&rsquo; in
order to use SSH protocol version 1 or 2 explicitly.

     <p>CCC: Do we have to connect to the remote host once from the command
line to accept the SSH key?  Maybe this can be made automatic?

     <p>CCC: Say something about the first shell command failing.  This might
be due to a wrong setting of <code>tramp-rsh-end-of-line</code>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">plinkx</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-plinkx-37"></a><a name="index-plinkx-method-38"></a>
Another method using PuTTY on Windows.  Instead of host names, it
expects PuTTY session names, calling &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plink -load </span><var>session</var><span class="samp">
-t"</span></samp>&rsquo;.  User names are relevant only in case the corresponding session
hasn't defined a user name.  Different port numbers must be defined in
the session.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">fish</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-fish-39"></a><a name="index-fish-method-40"></a>
This is an experimental implementation of the fish protocol, known from
the GNU Midnight Commander or the KDE Konqueror.  <span class="sc">tramp</span> expects
the fish server implementation from the KDE kioslave.  That means, the
file <samp><span class="file">~/.fishsrv.pl</span></samp> is expected to reside on the remote host.

     <p>The implementation lacks good performance.  The code is offered anyway,
maybe somebody can improve the performance.
