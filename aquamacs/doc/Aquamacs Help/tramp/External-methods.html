<h3 class="section">4.3 External methods</h3>

<p><a name="index-methods_002c-external-41"></a><a name="index-external-methods-42"></a>
The external methods operate through multiple channels, using the
remote shell connection for many actions while delegating file
transfers to an external transfer utility.

   <p>This saves the overhead of encoding and decoding that multiplexing the
transfer through the one connection has with the inline methods.

   <p>Since external methods need their own overhead opening a new channel,
all files which are smaller than <var>tramp-copy-size-limit</var> are still
transferred with the corresponding inline method.  It should provide a
fair trade-off between both approaches.

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">rcp</span></samp>  &mdash;  <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">rcp</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-rcp-43"></a><a name="index-rcp-method-44"></a><a name="index-rcp-_0028with-rcp-method_0029-45"></a><a name="index-rsh-_0028with-rcp-method_0029-46"></a>
This method uses the <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">rcp</span></samp> commands to connect
to the remote machine and transfer files.  This is probably the fastest
connection method available.

     <p>The alternative method <samp><span class="option">remcp</span></samp> uses the <samp><span class="command">remsh</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">rcp</span></samp> commands.  It should be applied on machines where
<samp><span class="command">remsh</span></samp> is used instead of <samp><span class="command">rsh</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp>  &mdash;  <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-scp-47"></a><a name="index-scp-method-48"></a><a name="index-scp-_0028with-scp-method_0029-49"></a><a name="index-ssh-_0028with-scp-method_0029-50"></a>
Using <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> to connect to the remote host and <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp> to
transfer files between the machines is the best method for securely
connecting to a remote machine and accessing files.

     <p>The performance of this option is also quite good.  It may be slower than
the inline methods when you often open and close small files however. 
The cost of the cryptographic handshake at the start of an <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp>
session can begin to absorb the advantage that the lack of encoding and
decoding presents.

     <p>There are also two variants, <samp><span class="option">scp1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">scp2</span></samp>, that
call &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh -1</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh -2</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively.  This way, you can
explicitly select whether you want to use the SSH protocol version 1
or 2 to connect to the remote host.  (You can also specify in
<samp><span class="file">~/.ssh/config</span></samp>, the SSH configuration file, which protocol
should be used, and use the regular <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp> method.)

     <p>Two other variants, <samp><span class="option">scp1_old</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">scp2_old</span></samp>, use the
<samp><span class="command">ssh1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ssh2</span></samp> commands explicitly.  If you don't
know what these are, you do not need these options.

     <p>All the <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> based methods support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; feature
where you can specify a port number to connect to in the host name. 
For example, the host name <samp><span class="file">host#42</span></samp> tells <span class="sc">tramp</span> to
specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p 42</span></samp>&rsquo; in the argument list for <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>, and to
specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-P 42</span></samp>&rsquo; in the argument list for <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">sftp</span></samp>  &mdash;  <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">sftp</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-sftp-51"></a><a name="index-sftp-method-52"></a><a name="index-sftp-_0028with-sftp-method_0029-53"></a><a name="index-ssh-_0028with-sftp-method_0029-54"></a>
That is mostly the same method as <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp>, but using
<samp><span class="command">sftp</span></samp> as transfer command.  So the same remarks are valid.

     <p>This command does not work like Ange-FTP, where
<samp><span class="command">ftp</span></samp> is called interactively, and all commands are send from
within this session.  Instead of, <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> is used for login.

     <p>This method supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">rsync</span></samp>  &mdash;  <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-rsync-55"></a><a name="index-rsync-method-56"></a><a name="index-rsync-_0028with-rsync-method_0029-57"></a><a name="index-ssh-_0028with-rsync-method_0029-58"></a>
Using the <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> command to connect securely to the remote
machine and the <samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp> command to transfer files is almost
identical to the <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp> method.

     <p>While <samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp> performs much better than <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp> when
transferring files that exist on both hosts, this advantage is lost if
the file exists only on one side of the connection.  A file can exists
on both the remote and local host, when you copy a file from/to a
remote host.  When you just open a file from the remote host (or write
a file there), a temporary file on the local side is kept as long as
the corresponding buffer, visiting this file, is alive.

     <p>This method supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">scpx</span></samp> &mdash; <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-scpx-59"></a><a name="index-scpx-method-60"></a><a name="index-scp-_0028with-scpx-method_0029-61"></a><a name="index-ssh-_0028with-scpx-method_0029-62"></a>
As you would expect, this is similar to <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp>, only a little
different.  Whereas <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp> opens a normal interactive shell on
the remote host, this option uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh -t -t </span><var>host</var><span class="samp"> -l
</span><var>user</var><span class="samp"> /bin/sh</span></samp>&rsquo; to open a connection.  This is useful for users
where the normal login shell is set up to ask them a number of
questions when logging in.  This procedure avoids these questions, and
just gives <span class="sc">tramp</span> a more-or-less `standard' login shell to work
with.

     <p>This is also useful for Windows users where <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>, when
invoked from an GNU Emacs buffer, tells them that it is not
allocating a pseudo tty.  When this happens, the login shell is wont
to not print any shell prompt, which confuses <span class="sc">tramp</span> mightily.

     <p>This method supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">scpc</span></samp> &mdash; <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-scpc-63"></a><a name="index-scpc-method-64"></a><a name="index-scp-_0028with-scpc-method_0029-65"></a><a name="index-ssh-_0028with-scpc-method_0029-66"></a>
Newer versions of <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp> (for example OpenSSH 4) offer an option
<samp><span class="option">ControlMaster</span></samp>.  This allows <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp> to reuse an existing
<samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp> channel, which increases performance.

     <p>Before you use this method, you shall check whether your <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp>
implementation does support this option.  Try from the command line

     <pre class="example">          ssh localhost -o ControlMaster=yes
</pre>
     <p>This method supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">rsyncc</span></samp>  &mdash;  <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-rsyncc-67"></a><a name="index-rsyncc-method-68"></a><a name="index-rsync-_0028with-rsyncc-method_0029-69"></a><a name="index-ssh-_0028with-rsyncc-method_0029-70"></a>
Like the <samp><span class="option">scpc</span></samp> method, <samp><span class="option">rsyncc</span></samp> improves the underlying
<samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> connection by the option <samp><span class="option">ControlMaster</span></samp>.  This
allows <samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp> to reuse an existing <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> channel,
which increases performance.

     <p>This method supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">pscp</span></samp> &mdash; <samp><span class="command">plink</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">pscp</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-pscp-71"></a><a name="index-pscp-method-72"></a><a name="index-pscp-_0028with-pscp-method_0029-73"></a><a name="index-plink-_0028with-pscp-method_0029-74"></a><a name="index-PuTTY-_0028with-pscp-method_0029-75"></a>
This method is similar to <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp>, but it uses the
<samp><span class="command">plink</span></samp> command to connect to the remote host, and it uses
<samp><span class="command">pscp</span></samp> for transferring the files.  These programs are part
of PuTTY, an SSH implementation for Windows.

     <p>This method supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-P</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">psftp</span></samp> &mdash; <samp><span class="command">plink</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">psftp</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-psftp-76"></a><a name="index-psftp-method-77"></a><a name="index-psftp-_0028with-psftp-method_0029-78"></a><a name="index-plink-_0028with-psftp-method_0029-79"></a><a name="index-PuTTY-_0028with-psftp-method_0029-80"></a>
As you would expect, this method is similar to <samp><span class="option">sftp</span></samp>, but it
uses the <samp><span class="command">plink</span></samp> command to connect to the remote host, and it
uses <samp><span class="command">psftp</span></samp> for transferring the files.  These programs are
part of PuTTY, an SSH implementation for Windows.

     <p>This method supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-P</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">fcp</span></samp> &mdash; <samp><span class="command">fsh</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">fcp</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-fcp-81"></a><a name="index-fcp-method-82"></a><a name="index-fsh-_0028with-fcp-method_0029-83"></a><a name="index-fcp-_0028with-fcp-method_0029-84"></a>
This method is similar to <samp><span class="option">scp</span></samp>, but it uses the <samp><span class="command">fsh</span></samp>
command to connect to the remote host, and it uses <samp><span class="command">fcp</span></samp> for
transferring the files.  <samp><span class="command">fsh/fcp</span></samp> are a front-end for
<samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> which allow for reusing the same <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> session
for submitting several commands.  This avoids the startup overhead of
<samp><span class="command">scp</span></samp> (which has to establish a secure connection whenever it
is called).  Note, however, that you can also use one of the inline
methods to achieve a similar effect.

     <p>This method uses the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fsh </span><var>host</var><span class="samp"> -l </span><var>user</var><span class="samp">
/bin/sh -i</span></samp>&rsquo; to establish the connection, it does not work to just say
<samp><span class="command">fsh </span><var>host</var><span class="command"> -l </span><var>user</var></samp>.

     <p><a name="index-method-fsh-85"></a><a name="index-fsh-method-86"></a>
There is no inline method using <samp><span class="command">fsh</span></samp> as the multiplexing
provided by the program is not very useful in our context.  <span class="sc">tramp</span>
opens just one connection to the remote host and then keeps it open,
anyway.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">ftp</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-ftp-87"></a><a name="index-ftp-method-88"></a>
This is not a native <span class="sc">tramp</span> method.  Instead of, it forwards all
requests to Ange-FTP.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">smb</span></samp> &mdash; <samp><span class="command">smbclient</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-smb-89"></a><a name="index-smb-method-90"></a>
This is another not natural <span class="sc">tramp</span> method.  It uses the
<samp><span class="command">smbclient</span></samp> command on different Unices in order to connect to
an SMB server.  An SMB server might be a Samba (or CIFS) server on
another UNIX host or, more interesting, a host running MS Windows.  So
far, it is tested towards MS Windows NT, MS Windows 2000, and MS
Windows XP.

     <p>The first directory in the localname must be a share name on the remote
host.  Remember, that the <code>$</code> character in which default shares
usually end, must be written <code>$$</code> due to environment variable
substitution in file names.  If no share name is given (i.e. remote
directory <code>/</code>), all available shares are listed.

     <p>Since authorization is done on share level, you will be prompted
always for a password if you access another share on the same host. 
This can be suppressed by <a href="Password-handling.html#Password-handling">Password handling</a>.

     <p>MS Windows uses for authorization both a user name and a domain name. 
Because of this, the <span class="sc">tramp</span> syntax has been extended: you can
specify a user name which looks like <code>user%domain</code> (the real user
name, then a percent sign, then the domain name).  So, to connect to
the machine <code>melancholia</code> as user <code>daniel</code> of the domain
<code>BIZARRE</code>, and edit <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> in the home directory (share
<code>daniel$</code>) I would specify the filename <samp><span class="file">/smb<!-- /@w -->:daniel%BIZARRE<!-- /@w -->@melancholia:/daniel$$/.emacs</span></samp>.

     <p>Depending on the Windows domain configuration, a Windows user might be
considered as domain user per default.  In order to connect as local
user, the WINS name of that machine must be given as domain name. 
Usually, it is the machine name in capital letters.  In the example
above, the local user <code>daniel</code> would be specified as
<samp><span class="file">/smb<!-- /@w -->:daniel%MELANCHOLIA<!-- /@w -->@melancholia:/daniel$$/.emacs</span></samp>.

     <p>The domain name as well as the user name are optional.  If no user
name is specified at all, the anonymous user (without password
prompting) is assumed.  This is different from all other <span class="sc">tramp</span>
methods, where in such a case the local user name is taken.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">smb</span></samp> method supports the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.

     <p><strong>Please note:</strong> If GNU Emacs runs locally under MS
Windows, this method isn't available.  Instead of, you can use UNC
file names like <samp><span class="file">//melancholia/daniel$$/.emacs</span></samp>.  The only
disadvantage is that there's no possibility to specify another user
name.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">imap</span></samp><dd><a name="index-method-imap-91"></a><a name="index-method-imaps-92"></a><a name="index-imap-method-93"></a><a name="index-imaps-method-94"></a>
Accessing an IMAP mailbox is intended to save files there as encrypted
message.  It could be used in case there are no other remote file
storages available.

     <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> supports both <samp><span class="option">imap</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">imaps</span></samp> methods. 
The latter one accesses the IMAP server over ssl.

     <p>Both methods support the port number specification.

     <p>Note, that special handling is needed for declaring a passphrase for
encryption / decryption of the messages (see <a href="Using-an-authentication-file.html#Using-an-authentication-file">Using an authentication file</a>).
