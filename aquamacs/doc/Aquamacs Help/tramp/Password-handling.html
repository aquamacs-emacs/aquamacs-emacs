<h3 class="section">4.12 Reusing passwords for several connections.</h3>

<p><a name="index-passwords-141"></a>
Sometimes it is necessary to connect to the same remote host several
times.  Reentering passwords again and again would be annoying, when
the chosen method does not support access without password prompt
through own configuration.

   <p>The best recommendation is to use the method's own mechanism for
password handling. Consider <samp><span class="command">ssh-agent</span></samp> for <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp>-like
methods, or <samp><span class="command">pageant</span></samp> for <samp><span class="option">plink</span></samp>-like methods.

   <p>However, if you cannot apply such native password handling,
<span class="sc">tramp</span> offers altenatives.

   <p><a name="Using-an-authentication-file"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.12.1 Using an authentication file</h4>

<p><a name="index-auth_002dsources-142"></a>The package <samp><span class="file">auth-source.el</span></samp>, originally developed in No Gnus,
offers the possibility to read passwords from a file, like FTP does it
from <samp><span class="file">~/.netrc</span></samp>.  The default authentication file is
<samp><span class="file">~/.authinfo.gpg</span></samp>, this can be changed via the variable
<code>auth-sources</code>.

<p class="noindent">A typical entry in the authentication file would be

<pre class="example">     machine melancholia port scp login daniel password geheim
</pre>
   <p>The port can be any <span class="sc">tramp</span> method (see <a href="Inline-methods.html#Inline-methods">Inline methods</a>,
see <a href="External-methods.html#External-methods">External methods</a>), to match only this method.  When you omit
the port, you match all <span class="sc">tramp</span> methods.

   <p>A special case are <samp><span class="option">imap</span></samp>-like methods.  Authentication with
the IMAP server is performed via <samp><span class="file">imap.el</span></samp>, there is no special
need from <span class="sc">tramp</span> point of view.  An additional passphrase, used
for symmetric encryption and decryption of the stored messages, should
be given with the special port indication <samp><span class="option">tramp-imap</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     machine melancholia port tramp-imap login daniel password ultrageheim
</pre>
   <p><a name="Caching-passwords"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">4.12.2 Caching passwords</h4>

<p>If there is no authentication file, <span class="sc">tramp</span> caches the passwords
entered by you.  They will be reused next time if a connection needs
them for the same user name and host name, independently of the
connection method.

   <p><a name="index-password_002dcache_002dexpiry-143"></a>Passwords are not saved permanently, that means the password caching
is limited to the lifetime of your GNU Emacs session.  You
can influence the lifetime of password caching by customizing the
variable <code>password-cache-expiry</code>.  The value is the number of
seconds how long passwords are cached.  Setting it to <code>nil</code>
disables the expiration.

   <p><a name="index-password_002dcache-144"></a>If you don't like this feature for security reasons, password caching
can be disabled totally by customizing the variable
<code>password-cache</code> (setting it to <code>nil</code>).

   <p>Implementation Note: password caching is based on the package
<samp><span class="file">password-cache.el</span></samp>.  For the time being, it is activated only
when this package is seen in the <code>load-path</code> while loading
<span class="sc">tramp</span>.
