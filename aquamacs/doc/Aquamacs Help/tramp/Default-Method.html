<h3 class="section">4.6 Selecting a default method</h3>

<p><a name="index-default-method-113"></a>
<a name="index-tramp_002ddefault_002dmethod-114"></a>When you select an appropriate transfer method for your typical usage
you should set the variable <code>tramp-default-method</code> to reflect that
choice.  This variable controls which method will be used when a method
is not specified in the <span class="sc">tramp</span> file name.  For example:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq tramp-default-method "ssh")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-tramp_002ddefault_002dmethod_002dalist-115"></a>You can also specify different methods for certain user/host
combinations, via the variable <code>tramp-default-method-alist</code>.  For
example, the following two lines specify to use the <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp>
method for all user names matching &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">john</span></samp>&rsquo; and the <samp><span class="option">rsync</span></samp>
method for all host names matching &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lily</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The third line
specifies to use the <samp><span class="option">su</span></samp> method for the user &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">root</span></samp>&rsquo; on
the machine &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">localhost</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<pre class="lisp">     (add-to-list 'tramp-default-method-alist '("" "john" "ssh"))
     (add-to-list 'tramp-default-method-alist '("lily" "" "rsync"))
     (add-to-list 'tramp-default-method-alist
                  '("\\`localhost\\'" "\\`root\\'" "su"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">See the documentation for the variable
<code>tramp-default-method-alist</code> for more details.

   <p>External methods are normally preferable to inline methods, giving
better performance.

   <p>See <a href="Inline-methods.html#Inline-methods">Inline methods</a>. 
See <a href="External-methods.html#External-methods">External methods</a>.

   <p>Another consideration with the selection of transfer methods is the
environment you will use them in and, especially when used over the
Internet, the security implications of your preferred method.

   <p>The <samp><span class="option">rsh</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">telnet</span></samp> methods send your password as
plain text as you log in to the remote machine, as well as
transferring the files in such a way that the content can easily be
read from other machines.

   <p>If you need to connect to remote systems that are accessible from the
Internet, you should give serious thought to using <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp> based
methods to connect.  These provide a much higher level of security,
making it a non-trivial exercise for someone to obtain your password
or read the content of the files you are editing.

<h4 class="subsection">4.6.1 Which method is the right one for me?</h4>

<p><a name="index-choosing-the-right-method-116"></a>
Given all of the above, you are probably thinking that this is all fine
and good, but it's not helping you to choose a method!  Right you are. 
As a developer, we don't want to boss our users around but give them
maximum freedom instead.  However, the reality is that some users would
like to have some guidance, so here I'll try to give you this guidance
without bossing you around.  You tell me whether it works <small class="dots">...</small>

   <p>My suggestion is to use an inline method.  For large files, external
methods might be more efficient, but I guess that most people will
want to edit mostly small files.  And if you access large text files,
compression (driven by <var>tramp-inline-compress-start-size</var>) shall
still result in good performance.

   <p>I guess that these days, most people can access a remote machine by
using <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>.  So I suggest that you use the <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp>
method.  So, type <kbd>C-x C-f /ssh<!-- /@w -->:root<!-- /@w -->@otherhost:/etc/motd &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to edit the <samp><span class="file">/etc/motd</span></samp> file on the other
host.

   <p>If you can't use <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp> to log in to the remote host, then
select a method that uses a program that works.  For instance, Windows
users might like the <samp><span class="option">plink</span></samp> method which uses the PuTTY
implementation of <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>.  Or you use Kerberos and thus like
<samp><span class="option">krlogin</span></samp>.

   <p>For the special case of editing files on the local host as another
user, see the <samp><span class="option">su</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">sudo</span></samp> methods.  They offer
shortened syntax for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">root</span></samp>&rsquo; account, like
<samp><span class="file">/su<!-- /@w -->::/etc/motd</span></samp>.

   <p>People who edit large files may want to consider <samp><span class="option">scpc</span></samp> instead
of <samp><span class="option">ssh</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">pscp</span></samp> instead of <samp><span class="option">plink</span></samp>.  These
external methods are faster than inline methods for large files. 
Note, however, that external methods suffer from some limitations. 
Please try first whether you really get a noticeable speed advantage
from using an external method!  Maybe even for large files, inline
methods are fast enough.
