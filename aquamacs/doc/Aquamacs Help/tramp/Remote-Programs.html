<h3 class="section">4.14 How <span class="sc">tramp</span> finds and uses programs on the remote machine.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">tramp</span> depends on a number of programs on the remote host in order to
function, including <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">test</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">cat</span></samp>.

   <p>In addition to these required tools, there are various tools that may be
required based on the connection method.  See <a href="Inline-methods.html#Inline-methods">Inline methods</a> and
<a href="External-methods.html#External-methods">External methods</a> for details on these.

   <p>Certain other tools, such as <samp><span class="command">perl</span></samp> (or <samp><span class="command">perl5</span></samp>) and
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> will be used if they can be found.  When they are
available, they are used to improve the performance and accuracy of
remote file access.

   <p><a name="index-tramp_002dremote_002dpath-147"></a><a name="index-tramp_002ddefault_002dremote_002dpath-148"></a><a name="index-tramp_002down_002dremote_002dpath-149"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>tramp-remote-path</b><var><a name="index-tramp_002dremote_002dpath-150"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>When <span class="sc">tramp</span> connects to the remote machine, it searches for the
programs that it can use.  The variable <code>tramp-remote-path</code>
controls the directories searched on the remote machine.

        <p>By default, this is set to a reasonable set of defaults for most
machines.  The symbol <code>tramp-default-remote-path</code> is a place
holder, it is replaced by the list of directories received via the
command <samp><span class="command">getconf PATH</span></samp> on your remote machine.  For example,
on GNU Debian this is <samp><span class="file">/bin:/usr/bin</span></samp>, whereas on Solaris this is
<samp><span class="file">/usr/xpg4/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/SUNWspro/bin</span></samp>.  It is
recommended to apply this symbol on top of <code>tramp-remote-path</code>.

        <p>It is possible, however, that your local (or remote ;) system
administrator has put the tools you want in some obscure local
directory.

        <p>In this case, you can still use them with <span class="sc">tramp</span>.  You simply
need to add code to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> to add the directory to the
remote path.  This will then be searched by <span class="sc">tramp</span> when you
connect and the software found.

        <p>To add a directory to the remote search path, you could use code such
as:

     <pre class="lisp">          <i>;; We load </i><span class="sc">tramp</span><i> to define the variable.</i>
          (require 'tramp)
          <i>;; We have </i><samp><span class="command">perl</span></samp><i> in "/usr/local/perl/bin"</i>
          (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/usr/local/perl/bin")
</pre>
        <p>Another possibility is to reuse the path settings of your remote
account, when you log in.  Usually, these settings are overwritten,
because they might not be useful for <span class="sc">tramp</span>.  The place holder
<code>tramp-own-remote-path</code> preserves these settings.  You can
activate it via

     <pre class="lisp">          (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path 'tramp-own-remote-path)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> caches several information, like the Perl binary
location.  The changed remote search path wouldn't affect these
settings.  In order to force <span class="sc">tramp</span> to recompute these values,
you must exit GNU Emacs, remove your persistency file
(see <a href="Connection-caching.html#Connection-caching">Connection caching</a>), and restart GNU Emacs.
