<h2 class="chapter">7 Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><a name="index-frequently-asked-questions-194"></a><a name="index-FAQ-195"></a>
     <ul>
<li>Where can I get the latest <span class="sc">tramp</span>?

     <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> is available under the URL below.

     <p class="noindent"><a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tramp/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tramp/</a>

     <p class="noindent">There is also a Savannah project page.

     <p class="noindent"><a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tramp/">http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tramp/</a>

     <li>Which systems does it work on?

     <p>The package has been used successfully on GNU Emacs 22, GNU Emacs 23,
XEmacs 21 (starting with 21.4), and SXEmacs 22.

     <p>The package was intended to work on Unix, and it really expects a
Unix-like system on the remote end (except the <samp><span class="option">smb</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">imap</span></samp> methods), but some people seemed to have some success
getting it to work on MS Windows XP/Vista/7 GNU Emacs.

     <li>How could I speed up <span class="sc">tramp</span>?

     <p>In the backstage, <span class="sc">tramp</span> needs a lot of operations on the
remote host.  The time for transferring data from and to the remote
host as well as the time needed to perform the operations there count. 
In order to speed up <span class="sc">tramp</span>, one could either try to avoid some
of the operations, or one could try to improve their performance.

     <p>Use an external method, like <samp><span class="option">scpc</span></samp>.

     <p>Use caching.  This is already enabled by default.  Information about
the remote host as well as the remote files are cached for reuse.  The
information about remote hosts is kept in the file specified in
<code>tramp-persistency-file-name</code>.  Keep this file.

     <p>Disable version control.  If you access remote files which are not
under version control, a lot of check operations can be avoided by
disabling VC.  This can be achieved by

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq vc-ignore-dir-regexp
                (format "\\(%s\\)\\|\\(%s\\)"
                        vc-ignore-dir-regexp
                        tramp-file-name-regexp))
</pre>
     <p>Disable excessive traces.  The default trace level of <span class="sc">tramp</span>,
defined in the variable <code>tramp-verbose</code>, is 3.  You should
increase this level only temporarily, hunting bugs.

     <li><span class="sc">tramp</span> does not connect to the remote host

     <p>When <span class="sc">tramp</span> does not connect to the remote host, there are three
reasons heading the bug mailing list:

          <ul>
<li>Unknown characters in the prompt

          <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> needs to recognize the prompt on the remote machine
after execution any command.  This is not possible, when the prompt
contains unknown characters like escape sequences for coloring.  This
should be avoided on the remote side.  See <a href="Remote-shell-setup.html#Remote-shell-setup">Remote shell setup</a>. for
setting the regular expression detecting the prompt.

          <p>You can check your settings after an unsuccessful connection by
switching to the <span class="sc">tramp</span> connection buffer <samp><span class="file">*tramp/foo*</span></samp>,
setting the cursor at the top of the buffer, and applying the expression

          <pre class="example">               <kbd>M-: (re-search-forward (concat tramp-shell-prompt-pattern "$"))</kbd>
</pre>
          <p>If it fails, or the cursor is not moved at the end of the buffer, your
prompt is not recognized correctly.

          <p>A special problem is the zsh, which uses left-hand side and right-hand
side prompts in parallel.  Therefore, it is necessary to disable the
zsh line editor on the remote host.  You shall add to <samp><span class="file">~/.zshrc</span></samp>
the following command:

          <pre class="example">               [ $TERM = "dumb" ] &amp;&amp; unsetopt zle &amp;&amp; PS1='$ '
</pre>
          <li>Echoed characters after login

          <p>When the remote machine opens an echoing shell, there might be control
characters in the welcome message.  <span class="sc">tramp</span> tries to suppress
such echoes via the <code>stty -echo</code> command, but sometimes this
command is not reached, because the echoed output has confused
<span class="sc">tramp</span> already.  In such situations it might be helpful to use
the <samp><span class="option">sshx</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">scpx</span></samp> methods, which allocate a pseudo tty. 
See <a href="Inline-methods.html#Inline-methods">Inline methods</a>.

          <li><span class="sc">tramp</span> doesn't transfer strings with more than 500 characters
correctly

          <p>On some few systems, the implementation of <code>process-send-string</code>
seems to be broken for longer strings.  It is reported for HP-UX,
FreeBSD and Tru64 Unix, for example.  This case, you should customize
the variable <code>tramp-chunksize</code> to 500.  For a description how to
determine whether this is necessary see the documentation of
<code>tramp-chunksize</code>.

          <p>Additionally, it will be useful to set <code>file-precious-flag</code> to
<code>t</code> for <span class="sc">tramp</span> files.  Then the file contents will be
written into a temporary file first, which is checked for correct
checksum.

          <pre class="lisp">               (add-hook
                'find-file-hooks
                '(lambda ()
                   (when (file-remote-p default-directory)
                     (set (make-local-variable 'file-precious-flag) t))))
</pre>
          </ul>

     <li><span class="sc">tramp</span> does not recognize hung <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> sessions

     <p>When your network connection is down, <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> sessions might
hang.  <span class="sc">tramp</span> cannot detect it safely, because it still sees a
running <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> process.  Timeouts cannot be used as well,
because it cannot be predicted, how long a remote command will last,
for example when copying very large files.

     <p>Therefore, you must configure the <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp> process to die
in such a case.  The following entry in <samp><span class="file">~/.ssh/config</span></samp> would do
the job:

     <pre class="example">          Host *
               ServerAliveInterval 5
</pre>
     <li>File name completion does not work with <span class="sc">tramp</span>

     <p>When you log in to the remote machine, do you see the output of
<samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> in color? If so, this may be the cause of your problems.

     <p><samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> outputs <acronym>ANSI</acronym> escape sequences that your terminal
emulator interprets to set the colors.  These escape sequences will
confuse <span class="sc">tramp</span> however.

     <p>In your <samp><span class="file">.bashrc</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.profile</span></samp> or equivalent on the remote
machine you probably have an alias configured that adds the option
<samp><span class="option">--color=yes</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--color=auto</span></samp>.

     <p>You should remove that alias and ensure that a new login <em>does not</em>
display the output of <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> in color.  If you still cannot use
filename completion, report a bug to the <span class="sc">tramp</span> developers.

     <li>File name completion does not work in large directories

     <p><span class="sc">tramp</span> uses globbing for some operations.  (Globbing means to use the
shell to expand wildcards such as `*.c'.)  This might create long
command lines, especially in directories with many files.  Some shells
choke on long command lines, or don't cope well with the globbing
itself.

     <p>If you have a large directory on the remote end, you may wish to execute
a command like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls -d * ..?* &gt; /dev/null</span></samp>&rsquo; and see if it hangs. 
Note that you must first start the right shell, which might be
<samp><span class="command">/bin/sh</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">ksh</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp>, depending on which
of those supports tilde expansion.

     <li>How can I get notified when <span class="sc">tramp</span> file transfers are complete?

     <p>The following snippet can be put in your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file.  It
makes GNU Emacs beep after reading from or writing to the
remote host.

     <pre class="lisp">          (defadvice tramp-handle-write-region
            (after tramp-write-beep-advice activate)
            "Make tramp beep after writing a file."
            (interactive)
            (beep))
          
          (defadvice tramp-handle-do-copy-or-rename-file
            (after tramp-copy-beep-advice activate)
            "Make tramp beep after copying a file."
            (interactive)
            (beep))
          
          (defadvice tramp-handle-insert-file-contents
            (after tramp-insert-beep-advice activate)
            "Make tramp beep after inserting a file."
            (interactive)
            (beep))
</pre>
     <li>I'ld like to get a Visual Warning when working in a sudo:ed context

     <p>When you are working with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">root</span></samp>&rsquo; privileges, it might be useful
to get an indication in the buffer's modeline.  The following code,
tested with GNU Emacs 22.1, does the job.  You should put it
into your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp>:

     <pre class="lisp">          (defun my-mode-line-function ()
            (when (string-match "^/su\\(do\\)?:" default-directory)
              (setq mode-line-format
                    (format-mode-line mode-line-format 'font-lock-warning-face))))
          
          (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'my-mode-line-function)
          (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'my-mode-line-function)
</pre>
     <li>I'ld like to see a host indication in the mode line when I'm remote

     <p>The following code has been tested with GNU Emacs 22.1.  You
should put it into your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp>:

     <pre class="lisp">          (defconst my-mode-line-buffer-identification
            (list
             '(:eval
               (let ((host-name
                      (if (file-remote-p default-directory)
                          (tramp-file-name-host
                           (tramp-dissect-file-name default-directory))
                        (system-name))))
                 (if (string-match "^[^0-9][^.]*\\(\\..*\\)" host-name)
                     (substring host-name 0 (match-beginning 1))
                   host-name)))
             ": %12b"))
          
          (setq-default
           mode-line-buffer-identification
           my-mode-line-buffer-identification)
          
          (add-hook
           'dired-mode-hook
           '(lambda ()
              (setq
               mode-line-buffer-identification
               my-mode-line-buffer-identification)))
</pre>
     <p>Since GNU Emacs 23.1, the mode line contains an indication if
<code>default-directory</code> for the current buffer is on a remote host. 
The corresponding tooltip includes the name of that host.  If you
still want the host name as part of the mode line, you can use the
example above, but the <code>:eval</code> clause can be simplified:

     <pre class="lisp">             '(:eval
               (let ((host-name
                      (or (file-remote-p default-directory 'host)
                          (system-name))))
                 (if (string-match "^[^0-9][^.]*\\(\\..*\\)" host-name)
                     (substring host-name 0 (match-beginning 1))
                   host-name)))
</pre>
     <li>My remote host does not understand default directory listing options

     <p>GNU Emacs computes the <samp><span class="command">dired</span></samp> options depending on
the local host you are working.  If your <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp> command on the
remote host does not understand those options, you can change them
like this:

     <pre class="lisp">          (add-hook
           'dired-before-readin-hook
           '(lambda ()
              (when (file-remote-p default-directory)
                (setq dired-actual-switches "-al"))))
</pre>
     <li>There's this <samp><span class="file">~/.sh_history</span></samp> file on the remote host which keeps
growing and growing.  What's that?

     <p>Sometimes, <span class="sc">tramp</span> starts <samp><span class="command">ksh</span></samp> on the remote host for
tilde expansion.  Maybe <samp><span class="command">ksh</span></samp> saves the history by default. 
<span class="sc">tramp</span> tries to turn off saving the history, but maybe you have
to help.  For example, you could put this in your <samp><span class="file">.kshrc</span></samp>:

     <pre class="example">          if [ -f $HOME/.sh_history ] ; then
             /bin/rm $HOME/.sh_history
          fi
          if [ "${HISTFILE-unset}" != "unset" ] ; then
             unset HISTFILE
          fi
          if [ "${HISTSIZE-unset}" != "unset" ] ; then
             unset HISTSIZE
          fi
</pre>
     <li>There are longish file names to type.  How to shorten this?

     <p>Let's say you need regularly access to <samp><span class="file">/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc</span></samp>, which is boring to type again and
again.  The following approaches can be mixed:

          <ol type=1 start=1>

          <li>Use default values for method and user name:

          <p>You can define default methods and user names for hosts,
(see <a href="Default-Method.html#Default-Method">Default Method</a>, see <a href="Default-User.html#Default-User">Default User</a>):

          <pre class="lisp">               (setq tramp-default-method "ssh"
                     tramp-default-user "news")
</pre>
          <p>The file name left to type would be
<kbd>C-x C-f /news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc</kbd>.

          <p>Note, that there are some useful settings already.  Accessing your
local host as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">root</span></samp>&rsquo; user, is possible just by <kbd>C-x C-f
/su<!-- /@w -->::</kbd>.

          <li>Use configuration possibilities of your method:

          <p>Several connection methods (i.e. the programs used) offer powerful
configuration possibilities (see <a href="Customizing-Completion.html#Customizing-Completion">Customizing Completion</a>).  In the
given case, this could be <samp><span class="file">~/.ssh/config</span></samp>:

          <pre class="example">               Host xy
                    HostName news.my.domain
                    User news
</pre>
          <p>The file name left to type would be <kbd>C-x C-f /ssh<!-- /@w -->:xy:/opt/news/etc</kbd>.  Depending on files in your directories, it is even
possible to complete the host name with <kbd>C-x C-f
/ssh:x &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.

          <li>Use environment variables:

          <p>File names typed in the minibuffer can be expanded by environment
variables.  You can set them outside GNU Emacs, or even with
Lisp:

          <pre class="lisp">               (setenv "xy" "/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/")
</pre>
          <p>Then you need simply to type <kbd>C-x C-f $xy &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, and here you
are.  The disadvantage is, that you cannot edit the file name, because
environment variables are not expanded during editing in the
minibuffer.

          <li>Define own keys:

          <p>You can define your own key sequences in GNU Emacs, which can
be used instead of <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>:

          <pre class="lisp">               (global-set-key
                [(control x) (control y)]
                (lambda ()
                  (interactive)
                  (find-file
                   (read-file-name
                    "Find Tramp file: "
                    "/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/"))))
</pre>
          <p>Simply typing <kbd>C-x C-y</kbd> would initialize the minibuffer for
editing with your beloved file name.

          <p>See also <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/TrampMode">the Emacs Wiki</a> for a more comprehensive example.

          <li>Define own abbreviation (1):

          <p>It is possible to define an own abbreviation list for expanding file
names:

          <pre class="lisp">               (add-to-list
                'directory-abbrev-alist
                '("^/xy" . "/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/"))
</pre>
          <p>This shortens the file openening command to <kbd>C-x C-f /xy
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  The disadvantage is, again, that you cannot edit the file
name, because the expansion happens after entering the file name only.

          <li>Define own abbreviation (2):

          <p>The <code>abbrev-mode</code> gives more flexibility for editing the
minibuffer:

          <pre class="lisp">               (define-abbrev-table 'my-tramp-abbrev-table
                 '(("xy" "/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/")))
               
               (add-hook
                'minibuffer-setup-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   (abbrev-mode 1)
                   (setq local-abbrev-table my-tramp-abbrev-table)))
               
               (defadvice minibuffer-complete
                 (before my-minibuffer-complete activate)
                 (expand-abbrev))
               
               ;; If you use partial-completion-mode
               (defadvice PC-do-completion
                 (before my-PC-do-completion activate)
                 (expand-abbrev))
</pre>
          <p>After entering <kbd>C-x C-f xy &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>, the minibuffer is
expanded, and you can continue editing.

          <li>Use bookmarks:

          <p>Bookmarks can be used to visit Tramp files or directories.

          <p>When you have opened <samp><span class="file">/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/</span></samp>, you should save the bookmark via
<kbd>&lt;menu-bar&gt; &lt;edit&gt; &lt;bookmarks&gt; &lt;set&gt;</kbd>.

          <p>Later on, you can always navigate to that bookmark via
<kbd>&lt;menu-bar&gt; &lt;edit&gt; &lt;bookmarks&gt; &lt;jump&gt;</kbd>.

          <li>Use recent files:

          <p><samp><span class="file">recentf</span></samp>
remembers visited places.

          <p>You could keep remote file names in the recent list without checking
their readability through a remote access:

          <pre class="lisp">               (recentf-mode 1)
</pre>
          <p>The list of files opened recently is reachable via
<kbd>&lt;menu-bar&gt; &lt;file&gt; &lt;Open Recent&gt;</kbd>.

          <li>Use filecache:

          <p><samp><span class="file">filecache</span></samp> remembers visited places.  Add the directory into
the cache:

          <pre class="lisp">               (eval-after-load "filecache"
                 '(file-cache-add-directory
                   "/ssh<!-- /@w -->:news<!-- /@w -->@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/"))
</pre>
          <p>Whenever you want to load a file, you can enter <kbd>C-x C-f
C-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> in the minibuffer.  The completion is done for the given
directory.

          <li>Use bbdb:

          <p><samp><span class="file">bbdb</span></samp> has a built-in feature for Ange-FTP files,
which works also for <span class="sc">tramp</span>.

          <p>You need to load <samp><span class="file">bbdb</span></samp>:

          <pre class="lisp">               (require 'bbdb)
               (bbdb-initialize)
</pre>
          <p>Then you can create a BBDB entry via <kbd>M-x bbdb-create-ftp-site</kbd>. 
Because BBDB is not prepared for <span class="sc">tramp</span> syntax, you must
specify a method together with the user name, when needed. Example:

          <pre class="example">               <kbd>M-x bbdb-create-ftp-site &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
               <b>Ftp Site:</b> news.my.domain &lt;RET&gt;
               <b>Ftp Directory:</b> /opt/news/etc/ &lt;RET&gt;
               <b>Ftp Username:</b> ssh:news &lt;RET&gt;
               <b>Company:</b> &lt;RET&gt;
               <b>Additional Comments:</b> &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
          <p>When you have opened your BBDB buffer, you can access such an entry by
pressing the key &lt;F&gt;.

          </ol>

     <p>I would like to thank all <span class="sc">tramp</span> users, who have contributed to
the different recipes!

     <li>How can I use <span class="sc">tramp</span> to connect to a remote GNU Emacs
session?

     <p>You can configure Emacs Client doing this.

     <p>On the remote host, you start the Emacs Server:

     <pre class="lisp">          (require 'server)
          (setq server-host (system-name)
                server-use-tcp t)
          (server-start)
</pre>
     <p>Make sure, that the result of <code>(system-name)</code> can be resolved on
your local host; otherwise you might use a hard coded IP address.

     <p>The resulting file <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/server/server</span></samp> must be copied to
your local host, at the same location.  You can call then the Emacs
Client from the command line:

     <pre class="example">          emacsclient /ssh<!-- /@w -->:user<!-- /@w -->@host:/file/to/edit
</pre>
     <p><code>user</code> and <code>host</code> shall be related to your local host.

     <p>If you want to use Emacs Client also as editor for other programs, you
could write a script <samp><span class="file">emacsclient.sh</span></samp>:

     <pre class="example">          #!/bin/sh
          emacsclient /ssh<!-- /@w -->:$(whoami)<!-- /@w -->@$(hostname --fqdn):$1
</pre>
     <p>Then you must set the environment variable <code>EDITOR</code> pointing to
that script:

     <pre class="example">          export EDITOR=/path/to/emacsclient.sh
</pre>
     <li>How can I disable <span class="sc">tramp</span>?

     <p>Shame on you, why did you read until now?

          <ul>
<li>If you just want to have Ange-FTP as default remote
files access package, you should apply the following code:

          <pre class="lisp">               (setq tramp-default-method "ftp")
</pre>
          <li>In order to disable
<span class="sc">tramp</span> (and Ange-FTP),
you must set <code>tramp-mode</code> to <code>nil</code>:

          <pre class="lisp">               (setq tramp-mode nil)
</pre>
          <li>Unloading <span class="sc">tramp</span> can be achieved by applying <kbd>M-x
tramp-unload-tramp</kbd>. 
This resets also the Ange-FTP plugins. 
</ul>
     </ul>
