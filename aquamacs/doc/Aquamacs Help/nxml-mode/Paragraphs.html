<h2 class="chapter">3 Paragraphs</h2>

<p>Emacs has several commands that operate on paragraphs, most
notably <kbd>M-q</kbd>. nXML mode redefines these to work in a way
that is useful for XML.  The exact rules that are used to find the
beginning and end of a paragraph are complicated; they are designed
mainly to ensure that <kbd>M-q</kbd> does the right thing.

   <p>A paragraph consists of one or more complete, consecutive lines. 
A group of lines is not considered a paragraph unless it contains some
non-whitespace characters between tags or inside comments.  A blank
line separates paragraphs.  A single tag on a line by itself also
separates paragraphs.  More precisely, if one tag together with any
leading and trailing whitespace completely occupy one or more lines,
then those lines will not be included in any paragraph.

   <p>A start-tag at the beginning of the line (possibly indented) may
be treated as starting a paragraph.  Similarly, an end-tag at the end
of the line may be treated as ending a paragraph. The following rules
are used to determine whether such a tag is in fact treated as a
paragraph boundary:

     <ul>
<li>If the schema does not allow text at that point, then it
is a paragraph boundary. 
<li>If the end-tag corresponding to the start-tag is not at
the end of its line, or the start-tag corresponding to the end-tag is
not at the beginning of its line, then it is not a paragraph
boundary. For example, in

     <pre class="example">          &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph with an
          &lt;emph&gt;emphasized&lt;/emph&gt; phrase.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;emph&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; start-tag would not be considered as
starting a paragraph, because its corresponding end-tag is not at the
end of the line. 
<li>If there is text that is a sibling in element tree, then
it is not a paragraph boundary.  For example, in

     <pre class="example">          &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph with an
          &lt;emph&gt;emphasized phrase that takes one source line&lt;/emph&gt;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;emph&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; start-tag would not be considered as
starting a paragraph, even though its end-tag is at the end of its
line, because there the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">This is a paragraph with an</span></samp>&rsquo;
is a sibling of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emph</span></samp>&rsquo; element. 
<li>Otherwise, it is a paragraph boundary. 
</ul>
