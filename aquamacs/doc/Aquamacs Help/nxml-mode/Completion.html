<h2 class="chapter">1 Completion</h2>

<p>Apart from real-time validation, the most important feature that
nxml-mode provides for assisting in document creation is "completion". 
Completion assists the user in inserting characters at point, based on
knowledge of the schema and on the contents of the buffer before
point.

   <p>The traditional GNU Emacs key combination for completion in a
buffer is <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>. However, many window systems
and window managers use this key combination themselves (typically for
switching between windows) and do not pass it to applications. It's
hard to find key combinations in GNU Emacs that are both easy to type
and not taken by something else.  <kbd>C-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (i.e. 
pressing the Enter or Return key, while the Ctrl key is held down) is
available.  It won't be available on a traditional terminal (because
it is indistinguishable from Return), but it will work with a window
system.  Therefore we adopt the following solution by default: use
<kbd>C-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> when there's a window system and
<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> when there's not.  In the following, I
will assume that a window system is being used and will therefore
refer to <kbd>C-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>Completion works by examining the symbol preceding point.  This
is the symbol to be completed. The symbol to be completed may be the
empty. Completion considers what symbols starting with the symbol to
be completed would be valid replacements for the symbol to be
completed, given the schema and the contents of the buffer before
point.  These symbols are the possible completions.  An example may
make this clearer.  Suppose the buffer looks like this (where -!-
indicates point):

<pre class="example">     &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
     &lt;h-!-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and the schema is XHTML.  In this context, the symbol to be completed
is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The possible completions consist of just
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">head</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Another example, is

<pre class="example">     &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
     &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;-!-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this case, the symbol to be completed is empty, and the possible
completions are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">base</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">isindex</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">link</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">meta</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">script</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">style</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">title</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Another example is:

<pre class="example">     &lt;html xmlns="-!-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this case, the symbol to be completed is empty, and the possible
completions are just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>When you type <kbd>C-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, what happens depends
on what the set of possible completions are.

     <ul>
<li>If the set of completions is empty, nothing
happens. 
<li>If there is one possible completion, then that completion is
inserted, together with any following characters that are
required. For example, in this case:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
          &lt;-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><kbd>C-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> will yield

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
          &lt;head-!-
</pre>
     <li>If there is more than one possible completion, but all
possible completions share a common non-empty prefix, then that prefix
is inserted. For example, suppose the buffer is:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html x-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The symbol to be completed is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. The possible completions
are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xmlns</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xml:lang</span></samp>&rsquo;.  These share a
common prefix of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xml</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Thus, <kbd>C-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
will yield:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html xml-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Typically, you would do <kbd>C-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> again, which would
have the result described in the next item. 
<li>If there is more than one possible completion, but the
possible completions do not share a non-empty prefix, then Emacs will
prompt you to input the symbol in the minibuffer, initializing the
minibuffer with the symbol to be completed, and popping up a buffer
showing the possible completions.  You can now input the symbol to be
inserted.  The symbol you input will be inserted in the buffer instead
of the symbol to be completed.  Emacs will then insert any required
characters after the symbol.  For example, if it contains:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html xml-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Emacs will prompt you in the minibuffer with

     <pre class="example">          Attribute: xml-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and the buffer showing possible completions will contain

     <pre class="example">          Possible completions are:
          xml:lang                           xmlns
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If you input <kbd>xmlns</kbd>, the result will be:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;html xmlns="-!-
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">(If you do <kbd>C-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> again, the namespace URI will
be inserted. Should that happen automatically?) 
</ul>
