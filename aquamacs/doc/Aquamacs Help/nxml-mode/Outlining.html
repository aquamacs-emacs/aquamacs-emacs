<h2 class="chapter">4 Outlining</h2>

<p>nXML mode allows you to display all or part of a buffer as an
outline, in a similar way to Emacs' outline mode.  An outline in nXML
mode is based on recognizing two kinds of element: sections and
headings.  There is one heading for every section and one section for
every heading.  A section contains its heading as or within its first
child element.  A section also contains its subordinate sections (its
subsections).  The text content of a section consists of anything in a
section that is neither a subsection nor a heading.

   <p>Note that this is a different model from that used by XHTML. 
nXML mode's outline support will not be useful for XHTML unless you
adopt a convention of adding a <code>div</code> to enclose each
section, rather than having sections implicitly delimited by different
<code>h</code><var>n</var> elements.  This limitation may be removed
in a future version.

   <p>The variable <code>nxml-section-element-name-regexp</code> gives
a regexp for the local names (i.e. the part of the name following any
prefix) of section elements. The variable
<code>nxml-heading-element-name-regexp</code> gives a regexp for the
local names of heading elements. For an element to be recognized
as a section

     <ul>
<li>its start-tag must occur at the beginning of a line
(possibly indented);
<li>its local name must match
<code>nxml-section-element-name-regexp</code>;
<li>either its first child element or a descendant of that
first child element must have a local name that matches
<code>nxml-heading-element-name-regexp</code>; the first such element
is treated as the section's heading. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">You can customize these variables using <kbd>M-x
customize-variable</kbd>.

   <p>There are three possible outline states for a section:

     <ul>
<li>normal, showing everything, including its heading, text
content and subsections; each subsection is displayed according to the
state of that subsection;
<li>showing just its heading, with both its text content and
its subsections hidden; all subsections are hidden regardless of their
state;
<li>showing its heading and its subsections, with its text
content hidden; each subsection is displayed according to the state of
that subsection. 
</ul>

   <p>In the last two states, where the text content is hidden, the
heading is displayed specially, in an abbreviated form. An element
like this:

<pre class="example">     &lt;section&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Food&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;para&gt;There are many kinds of food.&lt;/para&gt;
     &lt;/section&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would be displayed on a single line like this:

<pre class="example">     &lt;-section&gt;Food...&lt;/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If there are hidden subsections, then a <code>+</code> will be used
instead of a <code>-</code> like this:

<pre class="example">     &lt;+section&gt;Food...&lt;/&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If there are non-hidden subsections, then the section will instead be
displayed like this:

<pre class="example">     &lt;-section&gt;Food...
       &lt;-section&gt;Delicious Food...&lt;/&gt;
       &lt;-section&gt;Distasteful Food...&lt;/&gt;
     &lt;/-section&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The heading is always displayed with an indent that corresponds to its
depth in the outline, even it is not actually indented in the buffer. 
The variable <code>nxml-outline-child-indent</code> controls how much
a subheading is indented with respect to its parent heading when the
heading is being displayed specially.

   <p>Commands to change the outline state of sections are bound to
key sequences that start with <kbd>C-c C-o</kbd> (<kbd>o</kbd> is
mnemonic for outline).  The third and final key has been chosen to be
consistent with outline mode.  In the following descriptions
current section means the section containing point, or, more precisely,
the innermost section containing the character immediately following
point.

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-a</kbd> shows all sections in the buffer
normally. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-t</kbd> hides the text content
of all sections in the buffer. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-c</kbd> hides the text content
of the current section. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-e</kbd> shows the text content
of the current section. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-d</kbd> hides the text content
and subsections of the current section. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-s</kbd> shows the current section
and all its direct and indirect subsections normally. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-k</kbd> shows the headings of the
direct and indirect subsections of the current section. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-l</kbd> hides the text content of the
current section and of its direct and indirect
subsections. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-i</kbd> shows the headings of the
direct subsections of the current section. 
<li><kbd>C-c C-o C-o</kbd> hides as much as possible without
hiding the current section's text content; the headings of ancestor
sections of the current section and their child section sections will
not be hidden. 
</ul>

   <p>When a heading is displayed specially, you can use
&lt;RET&gt; in that heading to show the text content of the section
in the same way as <kbd>C-c C-o C-e</kbd>.

   <p>You can also use the mouse to change the outline state:
<kbd>S-mouse-2</kbd> hides the text content of a section in the same
way as<kbd>C-c C-o C-c</kbd>; <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> on a specially
displayed heading shows the text content of the section in the same
way as <kbd>C-c C-o C-e</kbd>; <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> on a specially
displayed start-tag toggles the display of subheadings on and
off.

   <p>The outline state for each section is stored with the first
character of the section (as a text property). Every command that
changes the outline state of any section updates the display of the
buffer so that each section is displayed correctly according to its
outline state.  If the section structure is subsequently changed, then
it is possible for the display to no longer correctly reflect the
stored outline state. <kbd>C-c C-o C-r</kbd> can be used to refresh
the display so it is correct again.
