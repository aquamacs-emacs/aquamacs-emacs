<h3 class="section">5.1 Commands for locating a schema</h3>

<p>The command <kbd>C-c C-s C-w</kbd> will tell you what schema
is currently being used.

   <p>The rules for locating a schema are applied automatically when
you visit a file in nXML mode. However, if you have just created a new
file and the schema cannot be inferred from the file-name, then this
will not locate the right schema.  In this case, you should insert the
start-tag of the root element and then use the command <kbd>C-c C-s
C-a</kbd>, which reapplies the rules based on the current content of
the document.  It is usually not necessary to insert the complete
start-tag; often just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span><var>name</var></samp>&rsquo; is
enough.

   <p>If you want to use a schema that has not yet been added to the
schema locating files, you can use the command <kbd>C-c C-s C-f</kbd>
to manually select the file containing the schema for the document in
current buffer.  Emacs will read the file-name of the schema from the
minibuffer. After reading the file-name, Emacs will ask whether you
wish to add a rule to a schema locating file that persistently
associates the document with the selected schema.  The rule will be
added to the first file in the list specified
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rng-schema-locating-files</span></samp>&rsquo;; it will create the file if
necessary, but will not create a directory. If the variable
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rng-schema-locating-files</span></samp>&rsquo; has not been customized, this
means that the rule will be added to the file &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schemas.xml</span></samp>&rsquo;
in the same directory as the document being edited.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-c C-s C-t</kbd> allows you to select a schema by
specifying an identifier for the type of the document.  The schema
locating files determine the available type identifiers and what
schema is used for each type identifier. This is useful when it is
impossible to infer the right schema from either the file-name or the
content of the document, even though the schema is already in the
schema locating file.  A situation in which this can occur is when
there are multiple variants of a schema where all valid documents have
the same document element.  For example, XHTML has Strict and
Transitional variants.  In a situation like this, a schema locating file
can define a type identifier for each variant. As with <kbd>C-c
C-s C-f</kbd>, Emacs will ask whether you wish to add a rule to a schema
locating file that persistently associates the document with the
specified type identifier.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-c C-s C-l</kbd> adds a rule to a schema
locating file that persistently associates the document with
the schema that is currently being used.
