<h3 class="section">2.2 Basic Visuals</h3>

<p><a name="index-visuals-10"></a>
Speedbar has visual cues for indicating different types of data.  These
cues are used consistently across the different speedbar modes to make
them easier to interpret.

   <p>At a high level, in File mode, there are directory buttons, sub
directory buttons, file buttons, tag buttons, and expansion buttons. 
This makes it easy to use the mouse to navigate a directory tree, and
quickly view files, or a summary of those files.

   <p>The most basic visual effect used to distinguish between these button
types is color and mouse highlighting.  Anything the mouse highlights
can be clicked on and is called a button (see <a href="Mouse-Bindings.html#Mouse-Bindings">Mouse Bindings</a>). 
Anything not highlighted by the mouse will not be clickable.

   <p>Text in speedbar consists of four different types of data.  Knowing how
to read these textual elements will make it easier to navigate by
identifying the types of data available.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.0.1 Groups</h5>

<p><a name="index-groups-11"></a>
Groups summarize information in a single line, and provide a high level
view of more complex systems, like a directory tree, or manual chapters.

   <p>Groups appear at different indentation levels, and are prefixed with a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; in some sort of `box'.  The group name will summarize the
information within it, and the expansion box will display that
information inline.  In File mode, directories and files are `groups'
where the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; is surrounded by brackets like this:

<pre class="example">     &lt;+&gt; include
     &lt;-&gt; src
      [+] foo.c
</pre>
   <p>In this example, we see both open and closed directories, in addition to
a file.  The directories have a box consisting of angle brackets, and a
file uses square brackets.

   <p>In all modes, a group can be `edited' by pressing <kbd>RET</kbd>, meaning a
file will be opened, or a directory explicitly opened in speedbar.  A
group can be expanded or contracted using <kbd>+</kbd> or
<kbd>-</kbd>.  See <a href="Basic-Key-Bindings.html#Basic-Key-Bindings">Basic Key Bindings</a>.

   <p>Sometimes groups may have a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; in its indicator box.  This means
that it is a group type, but there are no contents, or no known way of
extracting contents of that group.

   <p>When a group has been expanded, the indicator button changes from
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This indicates that the contents are being shown. 
Click the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; button to contract the group, or hide the contents
currently displayed.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.0.2 Tags</h5>

<p><a name="index-tags-12"></a>
Tags are the leaf nodes of the tree system.  Tags are generally prefixed
with a simple character, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Tags can only be jumped to using
<kbd>RET</kbd> or <kbd>e</kbd>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.0.3 Boolean Flags</h5>

<p>Sometimes a group or tag is given a boolean flag.  These flags appear as
extra text characters at the end of the line.  File mode uses boolean
flags, such as a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to indicate that a file has been checked out
of a versioning system.

   <p>For additional flags, see
<!-- Note to self, update these to sub-nodes which are more relevant. -->
<a href="File-Mode.html#File-Mode">File Mode</a>, and <a href="Version-Control.html#Version-Control">Version Control</a>.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.0.4 Unadorned Text</h5>

<p>Unadorned text generally starts in column 0, without any special symbols
prefixing them.  In Buffers mode different buffer groups are prefixed
with a description of what the following buffers are (Files, scratch
buffers, and invisible buffers.)

   <p>Unadorned text will generally be colorless, and not clickable.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.0.5 Color Cues</h5>

<p>Each type of Group, item indicator, and label is given a different
color.  The colors chosen are dependent on whether the background color
is light or dark. 
Of important note is that the `current item', which may be a buffer or
file name, is highlighted red, and underlined.

   <p>Colors can be customized from the group <code>speedbar-faces</code>.  Some
modes, such as for Info, will use the Info colors instead of default
speedbar colors as an indication of what is currently being displayed.

   <p>The face naming convention mirrors the File display mode.  Modes which
do not use files will attempt to use the same colors on analogous
entries.
