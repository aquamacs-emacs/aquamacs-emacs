<h3 class="section">3.1 Topic Interface</h3>

<p><a name="index-topic-interface-11"></a>
The topic interface is accessed principally via the command
<code>woman</code>.  The same command can be accessed via the menu item
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Help-&gt;Manuals-&gt;Read Man Page (WoMan)...</span></samp>&rsquo; once WoMan has been
loaded.  The command reads a manual topic in the minibuffer, which can
be the <dfn>basename</dfn> of a man file anywhere in the man file
structure.  The &ldquo;basename&rdquo; in this context means the filename
without any directory component and without any extension or suffix
components that relate to the file type.  So, for example, if there is
a compressed source file in Chapter 5 of the UNIX Programmer's Manual
with the full pathname <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/man/man5/man.conf.5.gz</span></samp> then
the topic is <code>man.conf</code>.  Provided WoMan is configured correctly,
this topic will appear among the completions offered by <code>woman</code>. 
If more than one file has the same topic name then WoMan will prompt
for which file to format.  Completion of topics is case insensitive.

<p>Clearly, <code>woman</code> has to know where to look for man files and there
are two customizable user options that store this information:
<code>woman-manpath</code> and <code>woman-path</code>.  See <a href="Interface-Options.html#Interface-Options">Interface Options</a>.  If <code>woman-manpath</code> is not set explicitly then
WoMan tries to pick up the information that would be used by the
<code>man</code> command, as follows.  If the environment variable
<code>MANPATH</code> is set, which seems to be the standard mechanism under
UNIX, then WoMan parses that.  Otherwise, if WoMan can find a
configuration file named (by default) <samp><span class="file">man.conf</span></samp> (or something very
similar), which seems to be the standard mechanism under GNU/Linux, then
it parses that.  To be precise, &ldquo;something very similar&rdquo; means
starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">man</span></samp>&rsquo; and ending with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.conf</span></samp>&rsquo; and possibly more
lowercase letters, e.g. <samp><span class="file">manual.configuration</span></samp>. 
The search path and/or precise full path name for this file are set by
the value of the customizable user option <code>woman-man.conf-path</code>. 
If all else fails, WoMan uses a plausible default man search path.

<p>If the above default configuration does not work correctly for any
reason then simply customize the value of <code>woman-manpath</code>.  To
access man files that are not in a conventional man file hierarchy,
customize the value of <code>woman-path</code> to include the directories
containing the files.  In this way, <code>woman</code> can access manual files
<em>anywhere</em> in the entire file system.

<p>There are two differences between <code>woman-manpath</code> and
<code>woman-path</code>.  Firstly, the elements of <code>woman-manpath</code> must
be directories that contain <em>directories of</em> man files, whereas the
elements of <code>woman-path</code> must be directories that contain man files
<em>directly</em>.  Secondly, the last directory component of each element
of <code>woman-path</code> is treated as a regular (Emacs) match expression
rather than a fixed name, which allows collections of related
directories to be specified succinctly.  Also, elements of
<code>woman-manpath</code> can be conses, indicating a mapping from
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PATH</span></samp>&rsquo; environment variable components to man directory
hierarchies.

<p>For topic completion to work, WoMan must build a list of all the manual
files that it can access, which can be very slow, especially if a
network is involved.  For this reason, it caches various amounts of
information, after which retrieving it from the cache is very fast.  If
the cache ever gets out of synchronism with reality, running the
<code>woman</code> command with a prefix argument (e.g. <kbd>C-u M-x woman</kbd>)
will force it to rebuild its cache.  This is necessary only if the names
or locations of any man files change; it is not necessary if only their
contents change.  It would always be necessary if such a change occurred
whilst Emacs were running and after WoMan has been loaded.  It may be
necessary if such a change occurs between Emacs sessions and persistent
caching is used, although WoMan can detect some changes that invalidate
its cache and rebuild it automatically.

<p>Customize the variable <code>woman-cache-filename</code> to save the cache
between Emacs sessions.  This is recommended only if the <code>woman</code>
command is too slow the first time it is run in an Emacs session, while
it builds its cache in main memory, which <em>may</em> be <em>very</em>
slow.  See <a href="Cache.html#Cache">The WoMan Topic Cache</a>, for further details.
