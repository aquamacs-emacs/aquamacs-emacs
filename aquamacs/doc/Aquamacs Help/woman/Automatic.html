<h3 class="section">3.3 Automatic Interface</h3>

<p><a name="index-automatic-interface-21"></a>
Emacs provides an interface to detect automatically the format of a file
and decode it when it is visited.  It is used primarily by the
facilities for editing rich (i.e. formatted) text, as a way to store
formatting information transparently as <acronym>ASCII</acronym> markup.  WoMan can in
principle use this interface, but it must be configured explicitly.

<p>This use of WoMan does not seem to be particularly advantageous, so it
is not really supported.  It originated during early experiments on how
best to implement WoMan, before I implemented the current topic
interface, and I subsequently stopped using it.  I might revive it as a
mechanism for storing pre-formatted WoMan files, somewhat analogous to
the standard Unix <code>catman</code> facility.  In the meantime, it exists
for anyone who wants to experiment with it.  Once it is set up it is
simply a question of visiting the file and there is no WoMan-specific
user interface!

<p>To use it, put something like this in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  [The
call to <code>set-visited-file-name</code> is to avoid font-locking triggered
by automatic major mode selection.]

<pre class="lisp">     (autoload 'woman-decode-region "woman")
     
     (add-to-list 'format-alist
                  '(man "Unix man-page source format" "\\.\\(TH\\|ig\\) "
                        woman-decode-region nil nil
                        (lambda (arg)
                          set-visited-file-name
                          (file-name-sans-extension buffer-file-name))))
