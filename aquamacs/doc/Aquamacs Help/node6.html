What Makes Aquamacs Emacs Different from Other Text
  Editors</A>
</H2> If you look at some of the menu items and keyboard shortcuts, you will see some of the features that make Emacs different from other text editors. Although Aquamacs has been designed to present many of these features in an Aqua-friendly way, it does not hide these features. Aquamacs is a complete editing environment.

<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Sophisticated text processing.</SPAN> Aquamacs features text
  editing capabilities that go far beyond the average text editor. For
  instance, Aquamacs features several kinds of search and replace: it
  can replace text incrementally, it can search and replace text by
  complex patterns of characters (regular expressions) and not just by
  word matching, and so on. Aquamacs also features support for
  virtually every kind of text file imaginable: computer code such as
  C/C++, HTML, <SPAN CLASS="logo,LaTeX">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</SPAN>, XML, and other formats.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Buffers.</SPAN> One of the features that makes Emacs such a productive editing
environment for experienced users is the concept of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">buffers.</SPAN>
A buffer is, simply said, a document that is being edited. It can be
displayed in any window, and you can even display a buffer twice. But
buffers don't just hold text files. They can hold messages from a
program that's running, they can be shown in a window that you can use to
actually send commands that Aquamacs executes, and other functions. The
Buffers menu in Aquamacs Emacs allows you to switch quickly between
windows, to send execute or preview the code you are writing with a
couple of keystrokes, and to monitor logs of commands you are
executing.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Integration with additional tools.</SPAN> Aquamacs' &ldquo;Tools&rdquo;
  menu provides access to file comparison and version control,
  compiling and debugging of program code, the ability to read e-mail
  and newsgroups, and more.

In addition to its large number of features, Aquamacs also defines
some interface terms differently than other OS X applications. See
Table <A HREF="#tab:terms">1</A> for more information.

This list provides just a small sample of the functionality
available in Emacs. Aquamacs' customizations make Emacs much easier to
learn; it is possible to get started and become productive
quickly. However, harnessing all of Emacs' power, even with assistance
from the familiar Aqua user interface, will take time.
