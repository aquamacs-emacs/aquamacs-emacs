<h3 class="section">7.4 Selective Browsing</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is convenient to be able to step through only some difference
regions, those that match certain regular expressions, and to ignore all
others.  On other occasions, you may want to ignore difference regions that
match some regular expressions, and to look only at the rest.

   <p>The commands <kbd>#f</kbd> and <kbd>#h</kbd> let you do precisely this.

   <p>Typing <kbd>#f</kbd> lets you specify regular expressions that match difference
regions you want to focus on. 
We shall call these regular expressions <var>regexp-A</var>, <var>regexp-B</var> and
<var>regexp-C</var>. 
Ediff will then start stepping through only those difference regions
where the region in buffer A matches <var>regexp-A</var> and/or the region in
buffer B matches <var>regexp-B</var>, etc.  Whether `and' or `or' will be used
depends on how you respond to a question.

   <p>When scanning difference regions for the aforesaid regular expressions,
Ediff narrows the buffers to those regions.  This means that you can use
the expressions <kbd>\`</kbd> and <kbd>\'</kbd> to tie search to the beginning or end
of the difference regions.

   <p>On the other hand, typing <kbd>#h</kbd> lets you specify (hide) uninteresting
regions.  That is, if a difference region in buffer A matches
<var>regexp-A</var>, the corresponding region in buffer B matches <var>regexp-B</var>
and (if applicable) buffer C's region matches <var>regexp-C</var>, then the
region will be ignored by the commands <kbd>n</kbd>/&lt;SPC&gt;
(<code>ediff-next-difference</code>) and <kbd>p</kbd>/&lt;DEL&gt;
(<code>ediff-previous-difference</code>) commands.

   <p>Typing <kbd>#f</kbd> and <kbd>#h</kbd> toggles selective browsing on and off.

   <p>Note that selective browsing affects only <code>ediff-next-difference</code>
and <code>ediff-previous-difference</code>, i.e., the commands
<kbd>n</kbd>/&lt;SPC&gt; and <kbd>p</kbd>/&lt;DEL&gt;.  <kbd>#f</kbd> and <kbd>#h</kbd> do not
change the position of the point in the buffers.  And you can still jump
directly (using <kbd>j</kbd>)  to any numbered
difference.

   <p>Users can supply their own functions to specify how Ediff should do
selective browsing.  To change the default Ediff function, add a function to
<code>ediff-load-hook</code> which will do the following assignments:

<pre class="example">     (setq ediff-hide-regexp-matches-function 'your-hide-function)
     (setq ediff-focus-on-regexp-matches-function 'your-focus-function)
</pre>
   <p><strong>Useful hint</strong>: To specify a regexp that matches everything, don't
simply type &lt;RET&gt; in response to a prompt.  Typing &lt;RET&gt; tells Ediff
to accept the default value, which may not be what you want.  Instead, you
should enter something like &lt;^&gt; or &lt;$&gt;.  These match every
line.

   <p>You can use the status command, <kbd>i</kbd>, to find out whether
selective browsing is currently in effect.

   <p>The regular expressions you specified are kept in the local variables
<code>ediff-regexp-focus-A</code>, <code>ediff-regexp-focus-B</code>,
<code>ediff-regexp-focus-C</code>, <code>ediff-regexp-hide-A</code>,
<code>ediff-regexp-hide-B</code>, <code>ediff-regexp-hide-C</code>.  Their default value
is the empty string (i.e., nothing is hidden or focused on).  To change the
default, set these variables in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> using <code>setq-default</code>.

   <p>In addition to the ability to ignore regions that match regular
expressions, Ediff can be ordered to start skipping over certain
&ldquo;uninteresting&rdquo; difference regions.  This is controlled by the following
variable:

     <dl>
<dt><code>ediff-ignore-similar-regions</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dignore_002dsimilar_002dregions-162"></a>If <code>t</code>, causes Ediff to skip over "uninteresting" difference regions,
which are the regions where the variants differ only in the amount of the
white space and newlines.  This feature can be toggled on/off interactively,
via the command <kbd>##</kbd>. 
</dl>

   <p><strong>Please note:</strong> in order for this feature to work, auto-refining of
difference regions must be on, since otherwise Ediff won't know if there
are fine differences between regions.  On devices where Emacs can display
faces, auto-refining is a default, but it is not turned on by default on
text-only terminals.  In that case, you must explicitly turn auto-refining
on (such as, by typing <kbd>@</kbd>).

   <p><strong>Reassurance:</strong> If many such uninteresting regions appear in a row,
Ediff may take a long time to skip over them because it has to compute fine
differences of all intermediate regions.  This delay does not indicate any
problem.

   <p><a name="index-ediff_002dignore_002dcase_002doption-163"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dignore_002dcase_002doption3-164"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dignore_002dcase-165"></a>Finally, Ediff can be told to ignore the case of the letters. This behavior
can be toggled with <kbd>#c</kbd> and it is controlled with three variables:
<code>ediff-ignore-case-option</code>, <code>ediff-ignore-case-option3</code>, and
<code>ediff-ignore-case</code>.

   <p>The variable <code>ediff-ignore-case-option</code> specifies the option to pass
to the diff program for comparing two files or buffers. For GNU
<code>diff</code>, this option is <code>"-i"</code>. The variable
<code>ediff-ignore-case-option3</code> specifies the option to pass to the
<code>diff3</code> program in order to make it case-insensitive. GNU <code>diff3</code>
does not have such an option, so when merging or comparing three files with
this program, ignoring the letter case is not supported.

   <p>The variable <code>ediff-ignore-case</code> controls whether Ediff starts out by
ignoring letter case or not. It can be set in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> using
<code>setq-default</code>.

   <p>When case sensitivity is toggled, all difference
regions are recomputed.
