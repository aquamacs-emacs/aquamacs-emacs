<h2 class="chapter">6 Remote and Compressed Files</h2>

<p>Ediff works with remote, compressed, and encrypted files.  Ediff
supports <samp><span class="file">ange-ftp.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">jka-compr.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">uncompress.el</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">crypt++.el</span></samp>, but it may work with other similar packages as
well.  This means that you can compare files residing on another
machine, or you can apply a patch to a file on another machine.  Even
the patch itself can be a remote file!

   <p>When patching compressed or remote files, Ediff does not rename the source
file (unlike what the <code>patch</code> utility would usually do).  Instead, the
source file retains its name and the result of applying the patch is placed
in a temporary file that has the suffix <samp><span class="file">_patched</span></samp> attached. 
Generally, this applies to files that are handled using black magic, such
as special file handlers (ange-ftp and some compression and encryption
packages also use this method).

   <p>Regular files are treated by the <code>patch</code> utility in the usual manner,
i.e., the original is renamed into <samp><span class="file">source-name.orig</span></samp> and the result
of the patch is placed into the file source-name (<samp><span class="file">_orig</span></samp> is used
on systems like DOS, etc.)
