<h3 class="section">7.5 Highlighting Difference Regions</h3>

<p>The following variables control the way Ediff highlights difference
regions:

     <dl>
<dt><code>ediff-before-flag-bol</code><dt><code>ediff-after-flag-eol</code><dt><code>ediff-before-flag-mol</code><dt><code>ediff-after-flag-mol</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dbefore_002dflag_002dbol-166"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dafter_002dflag_002deol-167"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dbefore_002dflag_002dmol-168"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dafter_002dflag_002dmol-169"></a>These variables hold strings that Ediff uses to mark the beginning and the
end of the differences found in files A, B, and C on devices where Emacs
cannot display faces.  Ediff uses different flags to highlight regions that
begin/end at the beginning/end of a line or in a middle of a line.

     <br><dt><code>ediff-current-diff-face-A</code><dt><code>ediff-current-diff-face-B</code><dt><code>ediff-current-diff-face-C</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dcurrent_002ddiff_002dface_002dA-170"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dcurrent_002ddiff_002dface_002dB-171"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dcurrent_002ddiff_002dface_002dC-172"></a>Ediff uses these faces to highlight current differences on devices where
Emacs can display faces.  These and subsequently described faces can be set
either in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> or in <samp><span class="file">.Xdefaults</span></samp>.  The X resource for Ediff
is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ediff</span></samp>&rsquo;, <em>not</em> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emacs</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Please refer to Emacs manual for
the information on how to set X resources. 
<br><dt><code>ediff-fine-diff-face-A</code><dt><code>ediff-fine-diff-face-B</code><dt><code>ediff-fine-diff-face-C</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dfine_002ddiff_002dface_002dA-173"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dfine_002ddiff_002dface_002dB-174"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dfine_002ddiff_002dface_002dC-175"></a>Ediff uses these faces to show the fine differences between the current
differences regions in buffers A, B, and C, respectively.

     <br><dt><code>ediff-even-diff-face-A</code><dt><code>ediff-even-diff-face-B</code><dt><code>ediff-even-diff-face-C</code><dt><code>ediff-odd-diff-face-A</code><dt><code>ediff-odd-diff-face-B</code><dt><code>ediff-odd-diff-face-C</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002deven_002ddiff_002dface_002dA-176"></a><a name="index-ediff_002deven_002ddiff_002dface_002dB-177"></a><a name="index-ediff_002deven_002ddiff_002dface_002dC-178"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dodd_002ddiff_002dface_002dA-179"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dodd_002ddiff_002dface_002dB-180"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dodd_002ddiff_002dface_002dC-181"></a>Non-current difference regions are displayed using these alternating
faces.  The odd and the even faces are actually identical on monochrome
displays, because without colors options are limited. 
So, Ediff uses italics to highlight non-current differences.

     <br><dt><code>ediff-force-faces</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dforce_002dfaces-182"></a>Ediff generally can detect when Emacs is running on a device where it can
use highlighting with faces.  However, if it fails to determine that faces
can be used, the user can set this variable to <code>t</code> to make sure that
Ediff uses faces to highlight differences.

     <br><dt><code>ediff-highlight-all-diffs</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dhighlight_002dall_002ddiffs-183"></a>Indicates whether&mdash;on a windowing display&mdash;Ediff should highlight
differences using inserted strings (as on text-only terminals) or using
colors and highlighting.  Normally, Ediff highlights all differences, but
the selected difference is highlighted more visibly.  One can cycle through
various modes of highlighting by typing <kbd>h</kbd>.  By default, Ediff starts
in the mode where all difference regions are highlighted.  If you prefer to
start in the mode where unselected differences are not highlighted, you
should set <code>ediff-highlight-all-diffs</code> to <code>nil</code>.  Type <kbd>h</kbd> to
restore highlighting for all differences.

     <p>Ediff lets you switch between the two modes of highlighting.  That is,
you can switch interactively from highlighting using faces to
highlighting using string flags, and back.  Of course, switching has
effect only under a windowing system.  On a text-only terminal or in an
xterm window, the only available option is highlighting with strings. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">If you want to change the default settings for <code>ediff-force-faces</code> and
<code>ediff-highlight-all-diffs</code>, you must do it <strong>before</strong> Ediff is
loaded.

   <p>You can also change the defaults for the faces used to highlight the
difference regions.  There are two ways to do this.  The simplest and the
preferred way is to use the customization widget accessible from the
menubar.  Ediff's customization group is located under "Tools", which in
turn is under "Programming".  The faces that are used to highlight
difference regions are located in the "Highlighting" subgroup of the Ediff
customization group.

   <p>The second, much more arcane, method to change default faces is to include
some Lisp code in <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp>.  For instance,

<pre class="example">     (setq ediff-current-diff-face-A
           (copy-face 'bold-italic 'ediff-current-diff-face-A))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would use the pre-defined face <code>bold-italic</code> to highlight the current
difference region in buffer A (this face is not a good choice, by the way).

   <p>If you are unhappy with just <em>some</em> of the aspects of the default
faces, you can modify them when Ediff is being loaded using
<code>ediff-load-hook</code>.  For instance:

<pre class="smallexample">     (add-hook 'ediff-load-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (set-face-foreground
                   ediff-current-diff-face-B "blue")
                 (set-face-background
                   ediff-current-diff-face-B "red")
                 (make-face-italic
                   ediff-current-diff-face-B)))
</pre>
   <p><strong>Please note:</strong> to set Ediff's faces, use only <code>copy-face</code>
or <code>set/make-face-...</code> as shown above. Emacs' low-level
face-manipulation functions should be avoided.
