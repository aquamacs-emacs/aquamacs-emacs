  <h2 class="chapter">2 Major Entry Points</h2>

  <p>When Ediff starts up, it displays a small control window,
  which accepts the Ediff commands, and two or three windows
  displaying the files to be compared or merged. The control window
  can be in its own small frame or it can be part of a bigger frame
  that displays other buffers. In any case, it is important that
  the control window be active (i.e., be the one receiving the
  keystrokes) when you use Ediff. You can switch to other Emacs
  buffers at will and even edit the files currently being compared
  with Ediff and then switch back to Ediff at any time by
  activating the appropriate Emacs windows.</p>

  <p>Ediff can be invoked interactively using the following
  functions, which can be run either from the minibuffer or from
  the menu bar. In the menu bar, all Ediff's entry points belong to
  three submenus of the Tools menu: Compare, Merge, and Apply
  Patch.</p>

    <dt><code>ediff-patch-file</code></dt>

    <dt><code>epatch</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-ediff_002dpatch_002dfile-28" id=
      "index-ediff_002dpatch_002dfile-28"></a><a name=
      "index-epatch-29" id="index-epatch-29"></a> Patch a file or
      multiple files, then compare. If the patch applies to just
      one file, Ediff will invoke a regular comparison session. If
      it is a multi-file patch, then a session group interface will
      be used and the user will be able to patch the files
      selectively. See <a href=
      "Session-Groups.html#Session-Groups">Session Groups</a>, for
      more details.

      <p>Since the patch might be in a buffer or a file, you will
      be asked which is the case. To avoid this extra prompt, you
      can invoke this command with a prefix argument. With an odd
      prefix argument, Ediff assumes the patch is in a file; with
      an even argument, a buffer is assumed.</p>

      <p>Note that <code>ediff-patch-file</code> will actually use
      the <code>patch</code> utility to change the original files
      on disk. This is not that dangerous, since you will always
      have the original contents of the file saved in another file
      that has the extension <samp><span class=
      "file">.orig</span></samp>. Furthermore, if the file is under
      version control, then you can always back out to one of the
      previous versions (see the section on Version Control in the
      Emacs manual).</p>

      <p><code>ediff-patch-file</code> is careful about versions
      control: if the file to be patched is checked in, then Ediff
      will offer to check it out, because failing to do so may
      result in the loss of the changes when the file is checked
      out the next time.</p>

      <p>If you don't intend to modify the file via the patch and
      just want to see what the patch is all about (and decide
      later), then <code>ediff-patch-buffer</code> might be a
      better choice.<br /></p>
    </dd>

      compare. The buffer being patched and the file visited by
      that buffer (if any) is <em>not</em> modified. The result of
      the patch appears in some other buffer that has the name
      ending with <em>_patched</em>.

      <p>This function would refuse to apply a multifile patch to a
      buffer. Use <code>ediff-patch-file</code> for that (and when
      you want the original file to be modified by the
      <code>patch</code> utility).</p>

      <p>Since the patch might be in a buffer or a file, you will
      be asked which is the case. To avoid this extra prompt, you
      can invoke this command with a prefix argument. With an odd

      an even argument, a buffer is assumed.<br /></p>

  </dl>

  <p class="noindent">If you want Ediff to be loaded from the very
  beginning of your Emacs session, you should put this line in your
  <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file:</p>
  <pre class="example">
     (require 'ediff)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Otherwise, Ediff will be loaded automatically
  when you use one of the above functions, either directly or
  through the menus.</p>

  <p>When the above functions are invoked, the user is prompted for
  all the necessary information&mdash;typically the files or
  buffers to compare, merge, or patch. Ediff tries to be smart
  about these prompts. For instance, in comparing/merging files, it
  will offer the visible buffers as defaults. In prompting for
  files, if the user enters a directory, the previously input file
  name will be appended to that directory. In addition, if the
  variable <code>ediff-use-last-dir</code> is not <code>nil</code>,
  Ediff will offer previously entered directories as defaults
  (which will be maintained separately for each type of file, A, B,
  or C). <a name=
  "index-g_t_0040code_007bediff_002duse_002dlast_002ddir_007d-45"
  id=
  "index-g_t_0040code_007bediff_002duse_002dlast_002ddir_007d-45"></a>
  All the above functions use the POSIX <code>diff</code> or
  <code>diff3</code> programs to find differences between two
  files. They process the <code>diff</code> output and display it
  in a convenient form. At present, Ediff understands only the
  plain output from diff. Options such as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">-c</span></samp>&rsquo; are not supported, nor is the
  format produced by incompatible file comparison programs such as
  the VMS version of <code>diff</code>.</p>

  <p>The functions <code>ediff-files</code>,
  <code>ediff-buffers</code>, <code>ediff-files3</code>,
  <code>ediff-buffers3</code> first display the coarse, line-based
  difference regions, as reported by the <code>diff</code> program.
  The total number of difference regions and the current difference
  number are always displayed in the mode line of the control
  window.</p>

  <p>Since <code>diff</code> may report fairly large chunks of text
  as being different, even though the difference may be localized
  to just a few words or even to the white space or line breaks,
  Ediff further <em>refines</em> the regions to indicate which
  exact words differ. If the only difference is in the white space
  and line breaks, Ediff says so.</p>

  <p>On a color display, fine differences are highlighted with
  color; on a monochrome display, they are underlined. See <a href=
  "Highlighting-Difference-Regions.html#Highlighting-Difference-Regions">
  Highlighting Difference Regions</a>, for information on how to
  customize this.</p>

  <p>The commands <code>ediff-windows-wordwise</code>,
  <code>ediff-windows-linewise</code>,
  <code>ediff-regions-wordwise</code> and
  <code>ediff-regions-linewise</code> do comparison on parts of
  existing Emacs buffers. The commands
  <code>ediff-windows-wordwise</code> and
  <code>ediff-regions-wordwise</code> are intended for relatively
  small segments of buffers (e.g., up to 100 lines, depending on
  the speed of your machine), as they perform comparison on the
  basis of words rather than lines. (Word-wise comparison of large
  chunks of text can be slow.)</p>

  <p>To compare large regions, use
  <code>ediff-regions-linewise</code>. This command displays
  differences much like <code>ediff-files</code> and
  <code>ediff-buffers</code>.</p>

  <p>The functions <code>ediff-patch-file</code> and
  <code>ediff-patch-buffer</code> apply a patch to a file or a
  buffer and then run Ediff on the appropriate files/buffers,
  displaying the difference regions.</p>

  <p>The entry points <code>ediff-directories</code>,
  <code>ediff-merge-directories</code>, etc., provide a convenient
  interface for comparing and merging files in different
  directories. The user is presented with Dired-like interface from
  which one can run a group of related Ediff sessions.</p>

  <p>For files under version control, <code>ediff-revision</code>
  lets you compare the file visited by the current buffer to one of
  its checked-in versions. You can also compare two checked-in
  versions of the visited file. Moreover, the functions
  <code>ediff-directory-revisions</code>,
  <code>ediff-merge-directory-revisions</code>, etc., let you run a
  group of related Ediff sessions by taking a directory and
  comparing (or merging) versions of files in that directory.</p>
