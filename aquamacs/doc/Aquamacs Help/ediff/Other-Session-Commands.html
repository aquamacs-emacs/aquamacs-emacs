<h3 class="section">3.2 Other Session Commands</h3>

<p>The following commands can be invoked from within any Ediff session,
although some of them are not bound to a key.

     <dl>
<dt><code>eregistry</code><dt><code>ediff-show-registry</code><dd><a name="index-eregistry-109"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dshow_002dregistry-110"></a>This command brings up the registry of active Ediff sessions.  Ediff
registry is a device that can be used to resume any active Ediff session
(which may have been postponed because the user switched to some other
activity).  This command is also useful for switching between multiple
active Ediff sessions that are run at the same time.  The function
<code>eregistry</code> is an alias for <code>ediff-show-registry</code>. 
See <a href="Registry-of-Ediff-Sessions.html#Registry-of-Ediff-Sessions">Registry of Ediff Sessions</a>, for more information on this registry.

     <br><dt><code>ediff-toggle-multiframe</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dtoggle_002dmultiframe-111"></a>Changes the display from the multi-frame mode (where the quick help window
is in a separate frame) to the single-frame mode (where all Ediff buffers
share the same frame), and vice versa.  See
<code>ediff-window-setup-function</code> for details on how to make either of
these modes the default one.

     <p>This function can also be invoked from the Menubar.  However, in some
cases, the change will take place only after you execute one of the Ediff
commands, such as going to the next difference or redisplaying.

     <br><dt><code>ediff-toggle-use-toolbar</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dtoggle_002duse_002dtoolbar-112"></a>Available in XEmacs only.  The Ediff toolbar provides quick access to some
of the common Ediff functions.  This function toggles the display of the
toolbar.  If invoked from the menubar, the function may take sometimes
effect only after you execute an Ediff command, such as going to the next
difference.

     <br><dt><code>ediff-use-toolbar-p</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002duse_002dtoolbar_002dp-113"></a>The use of the toolbar can also be specified via the variable
<code>ediff-use-toolbar-p</code> (default is <code>t</code>).  This variable can be set
only in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> &mdash; do <strong>not</strong> change it interactively.  Use the
function <code>ediff-toggle-use-toolbar</code> instead.

     <br><dt><code>ediff-revert-buffers-then-recompute-diffs</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002drevert_002dbuffers_002dthen_002drecompute_002ddiffs-114"></a>This command reverts the buffers you are comparing and recomputes their
differences.  It is useful when, after making changes, you decided to
make a fresh start, or if at some point you changed the files being
compared but want to discard any changes to comparison buffers that were
done since then.

     <p>This command normally asks for confirmation before reverting files. 
With a prefix argument, it reverts files without asking.

     <br><dt><code>ediff-profile</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dprofile-115"></a>Ediff has an admittedly primitive (but useful) facility for profiling
Ediff's commands.  It is meant for Ediff maintenance&mdash;specifically, for
making it run faster.  The function <code>ediff-profile</code> toggles
profiling of ediff commands.
