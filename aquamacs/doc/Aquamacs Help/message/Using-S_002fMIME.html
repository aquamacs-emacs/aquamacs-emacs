<h4 class="subsection">2.7.2 Using S/MIME</h4>

<p><em>Note!</em>  This section assume you have a basic familiarity with
modern cryptography, <acronym>S/MIME</acronym>, various PKCS standards, OpenSSL and
so on.

   <p>The <acronym>S/MIME</acronym> support in Message (and <acronym>MML</acronym>) require
OpenSSL.  OpenSSL performs the actual <acronym>S/MIME</acronym> sign/encrypt
operations.  OpenSSL can be found at <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</a>. 
OpenSSL 0.9.6 and later should work.  Version 0.9.5a cannot extract mail
addresses from certificates, and it insert a spurious CR character into
<acronym>MIME</acronym> separators so you may wish to avoid it if you would like
to avoid being regarded as someone who send strange mail.  (Although by
sending <acronym>S/MIME</acronym> messages you've probably already lost that
contest.)

   <p>To be able to send encrypted mail, a personal certificate is not
required.  Message (<acronym>MML</acronym>) need a certificate for the person to whom you
wish to communicate with though.  You're asked for this when you type
<kbd>C-c C-m c s</kbd>.  Currently there are two ways to retrieve this
certificate, from a local file or from DNS.  If you chose a local
file, it need to contain a X.509 certificate in <acronym>PEM</acronym> format. 
If you chose DNS, you're asked for the domain name where the
certificate is stored, the default is a good guess.  To my belief,
Message (<acronym>MML</acronym>) is the first mail agent in the world to support
retrieving <acronym>S/MIME</acronym> certificates from DNS, so you're not
likely to find very many certificates out there.  At least there
should be one, stored at the domain <code>simon.josefsson.org</code>.  LDAP
is a more popular method of distributing certificates, support for it
is planned.  (Meanwhile, you can use <code>ldapsearch</code> from the
command line to retrieve a certificate into a file and use it.)

   <p>As for signing messages, OpenSSL can't perform signing operations
without some kind of configuration.  Especially, you need to tell it
where your private key and your certificate is stored.  <acronym>MML</acronym>
uses an Emacs interface to OpenSSL, aptly named <code>smime.el</code>, and it
contain a <code>custom</code> group used for this configuration.  So, try
<kbd>M-x customize-group RET smime RET</kbd> and look around.

   <p>Currently there is no support for talking to a CA (or RA) to create
your own certificate.  None is planned either.  You need to do this
manually with OpenSSL or using some other program.  I used Netscape
and got a free <acronym>S/MIME</acronym> certificate from one of the big CA's on the
net.  Netscape is able to export your private key and certificate in
PKCS #12 format.  Use OpenSSL to convert this into a plain X.509
certificate in PEM format as follows.

<pre class="example">     $ openssl pkcs12 -in ns.p12 -clcerts -nodes &gt; key+cert.pem
</pre>
   <p>The <samp><span class="file">key+cert.pem</span></samp> file should be pointed to from the
<code>smime-keys</code> variable.  You should now be able to send signed mail.

   <p><em>Note!</em>  Your private key is now stored unencrypted in the file,
so take care in handling it.  Storing encrypted keys on the disk are
supported, and Gnus will ask you for a passphrase before invoking
OpenSSL.  Read the OpenSSL documentation for how to achieve this.  If
you use unencrypted keys (e.g., if they are on a secure storage, or if
you are on a secure single user machine) simply press <code>RET</code> at
the passphrase prompt.
