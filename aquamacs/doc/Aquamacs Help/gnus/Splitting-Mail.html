  <h4 class="subsection">6.4.3 Splitting Mail</h4>

  <p><a name="index-splitting-mail-2064" id=
  "index-splitting-mail-2064"></a><a name=
  "index-mail-splitting-2065" id=
  "index-mail-splitting-2065"></a><a name=
  "index-mail-filtering-_0028splitting_0029-2066" id=
  "index-mail-filtering-_0028splitting_0029-2066"></a> <a name=
  "index-nnmail_002dsplit_002dmethods-2067" id=
  "index-nnmail_002dsplit_002dmethods-2067"></a>The
  <code>nnmail-split-methods</code> variable says how the incoming
  mail is to be split into groups.</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq nnmail-split-methods
       '(("mail.junk" "^From:.*Lars Ingebrigtsen")
         ("mail.crazy" "^Subject:.*die\\|^Organization:.*flabby")
         ("mail.other" "")))
</pre>

  <p>This variable is a list of lists, where the first element of
  each of these lists is the name of the mail group (they do not
  have to be called something beginning with
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mail</span></samp>&rsquo;, by the
  way), and the second element is a regular expression used on the
  header of each mail to determine if it belongs in this mail
  group. The first string may contain &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">\\1</span></samp>&rsquo; forms, like the ones used by
  <code>replace-match</code> to insert sub-expressions from the
  matched text. For instance:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     ("list.\\1" "From:.* \\(.*\\)-list@majordomo.com")
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">In that case,
  <code>nnmail-split-lowercase-expanded</code> controls whether the
  inserted text should be made lowercase. See <a href=
  "Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy Mail
  Splitting</a>.</p>

  <p>The second element can also be a function. In that case, it
  will be called narrowed to the headers with the first element of
  the rule as the argument. It should return a non-<code>nil</code>
  value if it thinks that the mail belongs in that group.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bbogus_007d-group-2068" id=
  "index-g_t_0040samp_007bbogus_007d-group-2068"></a>The last of
  these groups should always be a general one, and the regular
  expression should <em>always</em> be &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">""</span></samp>&rsquo; so that it matches any mails that
  haven't been matched by any of the other regexps. (These rules
  are processed from the beginning of the alist toward the end. The
  first rule to make a match will &ldquo;win&rdquo;, unless you
  have crossposting enabled. In that case, all matching rules will
  &ldquo;win&rdquo;.) If no rule matched, the mail will end up in
  the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bogus</span></samp>&rsquo;
  group. When new groups are created by splitting mail, you may
  want to run <code>gnus-group-find-new-groups</code> to see the
  new groups. This also applies to the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">bogus</span></samp>&rsquo; group.</p>

  <p>If you like to tinker with this yourself, you can set this
  variable to a function of your choice. This function will be
  called without any arguments in a buffer narrowed to the headers
  of an incoming mail message. The function should return a list of
  group names that it thinks should carry this mail message.</p>

  <p>This variable can also be a fancy split method. For the
  syntax, see <a href=
  "Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy Mail
  Splitting</a>.</p>

  <p>Note that the mail back ends are free to maul the poor,
  innocent, incoming headers all they want to. They all add
  <code>Lines</code> headers; some add <code>X-Gnus-Group</code>
  headers; most rename the Unix mbox <code>From&lt;SPACE&gt;</code>
  line to something else.</p>

  <p><a name="index-nnmail_002dcrosspost-2069" id=
  "index-nnmail_002dcrosspost-2069"></a>The mail back ends all
  support cross-posting. If several regexps match, the mail will be
  &ldquo;cross-posted&rdquo; to all those groups.
  <code>nnmail-crosspost</code> says whether to use this mechanism
  or not. Note that no articles are crossposted to the general
  (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">""</span></samp>&rsquo;)
  group.</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-nnmail_002dcrosspost_002dlink_002dfunction-2070" id=
  "index-nnmail_002dcrosspost_002dlink_002dfunction-2070"></a><a name="index-crosspost-2071"
  id="index-crosspost-2071"></a><a name="index-links-2072" id=
  "index-links-2072"></a><code>nnmh</code> and <code>nnml</code>
  makes crossposts by creating hard links to the crossposted
  articles. However, not all file systems support hard links. If
  that's the case for you, set
  <code>nnmail-crosspost-link-function</code> to
  <code>copy-file</code>. (This variable is
  <code>add-name-to-file</code> by default.)</p>

  <p><a name="index-M_002dx-nnmail_002dsplit_002dhistory-2073" id=
  "index-M_002dx-nnmail_002dsplit_002dhistory-2073"></a><a name=
  "index-nnmail_002dsplit_002dhistory-2074" id=
  "index-nnmail_002dsplit_002dhistory-2074"></a>If you wish to see
  where the previous mail split put the messages, you can use the
  <kbd>M-x nnmail-split-history</kbd> command. If you wish to see
  where re-spooling messages would put the messages, you can use
  <code>gnus-summary-respool-trace</code> and related commands (see
  <a href="Mail-Group-Commands.html#Mail-Group-Commands">Mail Group
  Commands</a>).</p>

  <p><a name=
  "index-nnmail_002dsplit_002dheader_002dlength_002dlimit-2075" id=
  "index-nnmail_002dsplit_002dheader_002dlength_002dlimit-2075"></a>Header
  lines longer than the value of
  <code>nnmail-split-header-length-limit</code> are excluded from
  the split function.</p>

  <p><a name="index-nnmail_002dmail_002dsplitting_002ddecodes-2076"
  id=
  "index-nnmail_002dmail_002dsplitting_002ddecodes-2076"></a><a name="index-nnmail_002dmail_002dsplitting_002dcharset-2077"
  id="index-nnmail_002dmail_002dsplitting_002dcharset-2077"></a>By
  default, splitting does not decode headers, so you can not match
  on non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> strings. But it is useful if you
  want to match articles based on the raw header data. To enable
  it, set the <code>nnmail-mail-splitting-decodes</code> variable
  to a non-<code>nil</code> value. In addition, the value of the
  <code>nnmail-mail-splitting-charset</code> variable is used for
  decoding non-<acronym>MIME</acronym> encoded string when
  <code>nnmail-mail-splitting-decodes</code> is
  non-<code>nil</code>. The default value is <code>nil</code> which
  means not to decode non-<acronym>MIME</acronym> encoded string. A
  suitable value for you will be <code>undecided</code> or be the
  charset used normally in mails you are interested in.</p>

  <p><a name="index-nnmail_002dresplit_002dincoming-2078" id=
  "index-nnmail_002dresplit_002dincoming-2078"></a>By default,
  splitting is performed on all incoming messages. If you specify a
  <code>directory</code> entry for the variable
  <code>mail-sources</code> (see <a href=
  "Mail-Source-Specifiers.html#Mail-Source-Specifiers">Mail Source
  Specifiers</a>), however, then splitting does <em>not</em> happen
  by default. You can set the variable
  <code>nnmail-resplit-incoming</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
  value to make splitting happen even in this case. (This variable
  has no effect on other kinds of entries.)</p>

  <p>Gnus gives you all the opportunity you could possibly want for
  shooting yourself in the foot. Let's say you create a group that
  will contain all the mail you get from your boss. And then you
  accidentally unsubscribe from the group. Gnus will still put all
  the mail from your boss in the unsubscribed group, and so, when
  your boss mails you &ldquo;Have that report ready by Monday or
  you're fired!&rdquo;, you'll never see it and, come Tuesday,
  you'll still believe that you're gainfully employed while you
  really should be out collecting empty bottles to save up for next
  month's rent money.</p>
