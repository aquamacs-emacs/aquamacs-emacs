<h4 class="subsection">7.15.2 Advanced Scoring Examples</h4>

<p>Please note that the following examples are score file rules.  To
make a complete score file from them, surround them with another pair
of parentheses.

   <p>Let's say you want to increase the score of articles written by Lars
when he's talking about Gnus:

<pre class="example">     ((&amp;
       ("from" "Lars Ingebrigtsen")
       ("subject" "Gnus"))
      1000)
</pre>
   <p>Quite simple, huh?

   <p>When he writes long articles, he sometimes has something nice to say:

<pre class="example">     ((&amp;
       ("from" "Lars Ingebrigtsen")
       (|
        ("subject" "Gnus")
        ("lines" 100 &gt;)))
      1000)
</pre>
   <p>However, when he responds to things written by Reig Eigil Logge, you
really don't want to read what he's written:

<pre class="example">     ((&amp;
       ("from" "Lars Ingebrigtsen")
       (1- ("from" "Reig Eigil Logge")))
      -100000)
</pre>
   <p>Everybody that follows up Redmondo when he writes about disappearing
socks should have their scores raised, but only when they talk about
white socks.  However, when Lars talks about socks, it's usually not
very interesting:

<pre class="example">     ((&amp;
       (1-
        (&amp;
         ("from" "redmondo@.*no" r)
         ("body" "disappearing.*socks" t)))
       (! ("from" "Lars Ingebrigtsen"))
       ("body" "white.*socks"))
      1000)
</pre>
   <p>Suppose you're reading a high volume group and you're only interested
in replies. The plan is to score down all articles that don't have
subject that begin with "Re:", "Fw:" or "Fwd:" and then score up all
parents of articles that have subjects that begin with reply marks.

<pre class="example">     ((! ("subject" "re:\\|fwd?:" r))
       -200)
     ((1- ("subject" "re:\\|fwd?:" r))
       200)
</pre>
   <p>The possibilities are endless.
