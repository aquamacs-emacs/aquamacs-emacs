<h4 class="subsection">6.6.2 Anything Groups</h4>

<p><a name="index-nneething-2391"></a>
From the <code>nndir</code> back end (which reads a single spool-like
directory), it's just a hop and a skip to <code>nneething</code>, which
pretends that any arbitrary directory is a newsgroup.  Strange, but
true.

   <p>When <code>nneething</code> is presented with a directory, it will scan this
directory and assign article numbers to each file.  When you enter such
a group, <code>nneething</code> must create &ldquo;headers&rdquo; that Gnus can use. 
After all, Gnus is a newsreader, in case you're forgetting. 
<code>nneething</code> does this in a two-step process.  First, it snoops each
file in question.  If the file looks like an article (i.e., the first
few lines look like headers), it will use this as the head.  If this is
just some arbitrary file without a head (e.g. a C source file),
<code>nneething</code> will cobble up a header out of thin air.  It will use
file ownership, name and date and do whatever it can with these
elements.

   <p>All this should happen automatically for you, and you will be presented
with something that looks very much like a newsgroup.  Totally like a
newsgroup, to be precise.  If you select an article, it will be displayed
in the article buffer, just as usual.

   <p>If you select a line that represents a directory, Gnus will pop you into
a new summary buffer for this <code>nneething</code> group.  And so on.  You can
traverse the entire disk this way, if you feel like, but remember that
Gnus is not dired, really, and does not intend to be, either.

   <p>There are two overall modes to this action&mdash;ephemeral or solid.  When
doing the ephemeral thing (i.e., <kbd>G D</kbd> from the group buffer), Gnus
will not store information on what files you have read, and what files
are new, and so on.  If you create a solid <code>nneething</code> group the
normal way with <kbd>G m</kbd>, Gnus will store a mapping table between
article numbers and file names, and you can treat this group like any
other groups.  When you activate a solid <code>nneething</code> group, you will
be told how many unread articles it contains, etc., etc.

   <p>Some variables:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nneething-map-file-directory</code><dd><a name="index-nneething_002dmap_002dfile_002ddirectory-2392"></a>All the mapping files for solid <code>nneething</code> groups will be stored
in this directory, which defaults to <samp><span class="file">~/.nneething/</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>nneething-exclude-files</code><dd><a name="index-nneething_002dexclude_002dfiles-2393"></a>All files that match this regexp will be ignored.  Nice to use to exclude
auto-save files and the like, which is what it does by default.

     <br><dt><code>nneething-include-files</code><dd><a name="index-nneething_002dinclude_002dfiles-2394"></a>Regexp saying what files to include in the group.  If this variable is
non-<code>nil</code>, only files matching this regexp will be included.

     <br><dt><code>nneething-map-file</code><dd><a name="index-nneething_002dmap_002dfile-2395"></a>Name of the map files. 
</dl>
