<h5 class="subsubsection">10.2.9.6 Oort Gnus</h5>

<p><a name="index-Oort-Gnus-3097"></a>
New features in Gnus 5.10:

     <ul>
<li>Installation changes
<!-- *********************** -->

          <ul>
<li>Upgrading from previous (stable) version if you have used Oort.

          <p>If you have tried Oort (the unstable Gnus branch leading to this
release) but went back to a stable version, be careful when upgrading to
this version.  In particular, you will probably want to remove all
<samp><span class="file">.marks</span></samp> (nnml) and <samp><span class="file">.mrk</span></samp> (nnfolder) files, so that flags are
read from your <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp> instead of from the
<samp><span class="file">.marks</span></samp>/<samp><span class="file">.mrk</span></samp> file where this release store flags.  See a
later entry for more information about marks.  Note that downgrading
isn't save in general.

          <li>Lisp files are now installed in <samp><span class="file">.../site-lisp/gnus/</span></samp> by default. 
It defaulted to <samp><span class="file">.../site-lisp/</span></samp> formerly.  In addition to this,
the new installer issues a warning if other Gnus installations which
will shadow the latest one are detected.  You can then remove those
shadows manually or remove them using <code>make
remove-installed-shadows</code>.

          <li>New <samp><span class="file">make.bat</span></samp> for compiling and installing Gnus under MS Windows

          <p>Use <samp><span class="file">make.bat</span></samp> if you want to install Gnus under MS Windows, the
first argument to the batch-program should be the directory where
<samp><span class="file">xemacs.exe</span></samp> respectively <samp><span class="file">emacs.exe</span></samp> is located, if you want
to install Gnus after compiling it, give <samp><span class="file">make.bat</span></samp> <code>/copy</code> as
the second parameter.

          <p><samp><span class="file">make.bat</span></samp> has been rewritten from scratch, it now features
automatic recognition of XEmacs and GNU Emacs, generates
<samp><span class="file">gnus-load.el</span></samp>, checks if errors occur while compilation and
generation of info files and reports them at the end of the build
process.  It now uses <code>makeinfo</code> if it is available and falls
back to <samp><span class="file">infohack.el</span></samp> otherwise.  <samp><span class="file">make.bat</span></samp> should now
install all files which are necessary to run Gnus and be generally a
complete replacement for the <code>configure; make; make install</code>
cycle used under Unix systems.

          <p>The new <samp><span class="file">make.bat</span></samp> makes <samp><span class="file">make-x.bat</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">xemacs.mak</span></samp>
superfluous, so they have been removed.

          <li><samp><span class="file">~/News/overview/</span></samp> not used.

          <p>As a result of the following change, the <samp><span class="file">~/News/overview/</span></samp>
directory is not used any more.  You can safely delete the entire
hierarchy.

          <!-- FIXME: `gnus-load' is mentioned in README, which is not included in -->
          <!-- the repository.  We should find a better place for this item. -->
          <li><code>(require 'gnus-load)</code>

          <p>If you use a stand-alone Gnus distribution, you'd better add
<code>(require 'gnus-load)</code> into your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> after adding the Gnus
lisp directory into load-path.

          <p>File <samp><span class="file">gnus-load.el</span></samp> contains autoload commands, functions and variables,
some of which may not be included in distributions of Emacsen.

     </ul>

     <li>New packages and libraries within Gnus
<!-- ***************************************** -->

          <ul>
<li>The revised Gnus <acronym>FAQ</acronym> is included in the manual,
See <a href="Frequently-Asked-Questions.html#Frequently-Asked-Questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.

          <li><acronym>TLS</acronym> wrapper shipped with Gnus

          <p><acronym>TLS</acronym>/<acronym>SSL</acronym> is now supported in <acronym>IMAP</acronym> and
<acronym>NNTP</acronym> via <samp><span class="file">tls.el</span></samp> and GNUTLS.  The old
<acronym>TLS</acronym>/<acronym>SSL</acronym> support via (external third party)
<samp><span class="file">ssl.el</span></samp> and OpenSSL still works.

          <li>Improved anti-spam features.

          <p>Gnus is now able to take out spam from your mail and news streams
using a wide variety of programs and filter rules.  Among the supported
methods are RBL blocklists, bogofilter and white/blacklists.  Hooks
for easy use of external packages such as SpamAssassin and Hashcash
are also new.  <a href="Thwarting-Email-Spam.html#Thwarting-Email-Spam">Thwarting Email Spam</a> and <a href="Spam-Package.html#Spam-Package">Spam Package</a>. 
<!-- FIXME: @xref{Spam Package}?.  Should this be under Misc? -->

          <li>Gnus supports server-side mail filtering using Sieve.

          <p>Sieve rules can be added as Group Parameters for groups, and the
complete Sieve script is generated using <kbd>D g</kbd> from the Group
buffer, and then uploaded to the server using <kbd>C-c C-l</kbd> in the
generated Sieve buffer.  See <a href="Sieve-Commands.html#Sieve-Commands">Sieve Commands</a>, and the new Sieve
manual <a href="../sieve/index.html#Top">Top</a>.

     </ul>

     <li>Changes in group mode
<!-- ************************ -->

          <ul>
<li><code>gnus-group-read-ephemeral-group</code> can be called interactively,
using <kbd>G M</kbd>.

          <li>Retrieval of charters and control messages

          <p>There are new commands for fetching newsgroup charters (<kbd>H c</kbd>) and
control messages (<kbd>H C</kbd>).

          <li>The new variable <code>gnus-parameters</code> can be used to set group parameters.

          <p>Earlier this was done only via <kbd>G p</kbd> (or <kbd>G c</kbd>), which stored
the parameters in <samp><span class="file">~/.newsrc.eld</span></samp>, but via this variable you can
enjoy the powers of customize, and simplified backups since you set the
variable in <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> instead of <samp><span class="file">~/.newsrc.eld</span></samp>.  The
variable maps regular expressions matching group names to group
parameters, a'la:
          <pre class="lisp">               (setq gnus-parameters
                     '(("mail\\..*"
                        (gnus-show-threads nil)
                        (gnus-use-scoring nil))
                       ("^nnimap:\\(foo.bar\\)$"
                        (to-group . "\\1"))))
</pre>
          <li>Unread count correct in nnimap groups.

          <p>The estimated number of unread articles in the group buffer should now
be correct for nnimap groups.  This is achieved by calling
<code>nnimap-fixup-unread-after-getting-new-news</code> from the
<code>gnus-setup-news-hook</code> (called on startup) and
<code>gnus-after-getting-new-news-hook</code>. (called after getting new
mail).  If you have modified those variables from the default, you may
want to add <code>nnimap-fixup-unread-after-getting-new-news</code> again.  If
you were happy with the estimate and want to save some (minimal) time
when getting new mail, remove the function.

          <li>Group names are treated as UTF-8 by default.

          <p>This is supposedly what USEFOR wanted to migrate to.  See
<code>gnus-group-name-charset-group-alist</code> and
<code>gnus-group-name-charset-method-alist</code> for customization.

          <li><code>gnus-group-charset-alist</code> and
<code>gnus-group-ignored-charsets-alist</code>.

          <p>The regexps in these variables are compared with full group names
instead of real group names in 5.8.  Users who customize these
variables should change those regexps accordingly.  For example:
          <pre class="lisp">               ("^han\\&gt;" euc-kr) -&gt; ("\\(^\\|:\\)han\\&gt;" euc-kr)
</pre>
          <li>Old intermediate incoming mail files (<samp><span class="file">Incoming*</span></samp>) are deleted
after a couple of days, not immediately.  See <a href="Mail-Source-Customization.html#Mail-Source-Customization">Mail Source Customization</a>.  (New in Gnus 5.10.10 / Emacs 22.2)

     </ul>

     <li>Changes in summary and article mode
<!-- ************************************** -->

          <ul>
<li><kbd>F</kbd> (<code>gnus-article-followup-with-original</code>) and <kbd>R</kbd>
(<code>gnus-article-reply-with-original</code>) only yank the text in the
region if the region is active.

          <li>In draft groups, <kbd>e</kbd> is now bound to <code>gnus-draft-edit-message</code>. 
Use <kbd>B w</kbd> for <code>gnus-summary-edit-article</code> instead.

          <li>Article Buttons

          <p>More buttons for URLs, mail addresses, Message-IDs, Info links, man
pages and Emacs or Gnus related references.  See <a href="Article-Buttons.html#Article-Buttons">Article Buttons</a>.  The
variables <code>gnus-button-</code><var>*</var><code>-level</code> can be used to control the
appearance of all article buttons.  See <a href="Article-Button-Levels.html#Article-Button-Levels">Article Button Levels</a>.

          <li>Single-part yenc encoded attachments can be decoded.

          <li>Picons

          <p>The picons code has been reimplemented to work in GNU Emacs&mdash;some of
the previous options have been removed or renamed.

          <p>Picons are small &ldquo;personal icons&rdquo; representing users, domain and
newsgroups, which can be displayed in the Article buffer. 
See <a href="Picons.html#Picons">Picons</a>.

          <li>If the new option <code>gnus-treat-body-boundary</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, a
boundary line is drawn at the end of the headers.

          <li>Signed article headers (X-PGP-Sig) can be verified with <kbd>W p</kbd>.

          <li>The Summary Buffer uses an arrow in the fringe to indicate the current
article.  Use <code>(setq gnus-summary-display-arrow nil)</code> to disable it.

          <li>Warn about email replies to news

          <p>Do you often find yourself replying to news by email by mistake?  Then
the new option <code>gnus-confirm-mail-reply-to-news</code> is just the thing for
you.

          <li>If the new option <code>gnus-summary-display-while-building</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, the summary buffer is shown and updated as it's being
built.

          <li>The new <code>recent</code> mark &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates newly arrived messages (as
opposed to old but unread messages).

          <li>Gnus supports RFC 2369 mailing list headers, and adds a number of
related commands in mailing list groups.  See <a href="Mailing-List.html#Mailing-List">Mailing List</a>.

          <li>The Date header can be displayed in a format that can be read aloud
in English.  See <a href="Article-Date.html#Article-Date">Article Date</a>.

          <li>diffs are automatically highlighted in groups matching
<code>mm-uu-diff-groups-regexp</code>

          <li>Better handling of Microsoft citation styles

          <p>Gnus now tries to recognize the mangled header block that some Microsoft
mailers use to indicate that the rest of the message is a citation, even
though it is not quoted in any way.  The variable
<code>gnus-cite-unsightly-citation-regexp</code> matches the start of these
citations.

          <p>The new command <kbd>W Y f</kbd>
(<code>gnus-article-outlook-deuglify-article</code>) allows deuglifying broken
Outlook (Express) articles.

          <li><code>gnus-article-skip-boring</code>

          <p>If you set <code>gnus-article-skip-boring</code> to <code>t</code>, then Gnus will
not scroll down to show you a page that contains only boring text,
which by default means cited text and signature.  You can customize
what is skippable using <code>gnus-article-boring-faces</code>.

          <p>This feature is especially useful if you read many articles that
consist of a little new content at the top with a long, untrimmed
message cited below.

          <li>Smileys (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:-)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;-)</span></samp>&rsquo; etc) are now displayed graphically in
Emacs too.

          <p>Put <code>(setq gnus-treat-display-smileys nil)</code> in <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> to
disable it.

          <li>Face headers handling.  See <a href="Face.html#Face">Face</a>.

          <li>In the summary buffer, the new command <kbd>/ N</kbd> inserts new messages
and <kbd>/ o</kbd> inserts old messages.

          <li>Gnus decodes morse encoded messages if you press <kbd>W m</kbd>.

          <li><code>gnus-summary-line-format</code>

          <p>The default value changed to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%U%R%z%I%(%[%4L: %-23,23f%]%)
%s\n</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Moreover <code>gnus-extra-headers</code>,
<code>nnmail-extra-headers</code> and <code>gnus-ignored-from-addresses</code>
changed their default so that the users name will be replaced by the
recipient's name or the group name posting to for <acronym>NNTP</acronym>
groups.

          <li>Deleting of attachments.

          <p>The command <code>gnus-mime-save-part-and-strip</code> (bound to <kbd>C-o</kbd>
on <acronym>MIME</acronym> buttons) saves a part and replaces the part with an
external one.  <code>gnus-mime-delete-part</code> (bound to <kbd>d</kbd> on
<acronym>MIME</acronym> buttons) removes a part.  It works only on back ends
that support editing.

          <li><code>gnus-default-charset</code>

          <p>The default value is determined from the
<code>current-language-environment</code> variable, instead of
<code>iso-8859-1</code>.  Also the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.*</span></samp>&rsquo; item in
<code>gnus-group-charset-alist</code> is removed.

          <li>Printing capabilities are enhanced.

          <p>Gnus supports Muttprint natively with <kbd>O P</kbd> from the Summary and
Article buffers.  Also, each individual <acronym>MIME</acronym> part can be
printed using <kbd>p</kbd> on the <acronym>MIME</acronym> button.

          <li>Extended format specs.

          <p>Format spec &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%&amp;user-date;</span></samp>&rsquo; is added into
<code>gnus-summary-line-format-alist</code>.  Also, user defined extended
format specs are supported.  The extended format specs look like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%u&amp;foo;</span></samp>&rsquo;, which invokes function
<code>gnus-user-format-function-</code><var>foo</var>.  Because &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; is used as the
escape character, old user defined format &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%u&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; is no longer supported.

          <li><kbd>/ *</kbd> (<code>gnus-summary-limit-include-cached</code>) is rewritten. 
<!-- FIXME: Was this a user-visible change? -->

          <p>It was aliased to <kbd>Y c</kbd>
(<code>gnus-summary-insert-cached-articles</code>).  The new function filters
out other articles.

          <li>Some limiting commands accept a <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix to negate the match.

          <p>If <kbd>C-u</kbd> is used on subject, author or extra headers, i.e., <kbd>/
s</kbd>, <kbd>/ a</kbd>, and <kbd>/ x</kbd>
(<code>gnus-summary-limit-to-{subject,author,extra}</code>) respectively, the
result will be to display all articles that do not match the expression.

          <li>Gnus inlines external parts (message/external).

     </ul>

     <li>Changes in Message mode and related Gnus features
<!-- **************************************************** -->

          <ul>
<li>Delayed articles

          <p>You can delay the sending of a message with <kbd>C-c C-j</kbd> in the Message
buffer.  The messages are delivered at specified time.  This is useful
for sending yourself reminders.  See <a href="Delayed-Articles.html#Delayed-Articles">Delayed Articles</a>.

          <li>If the new option <code>nnml-use-compressed-files</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
the nnml back end allows compressed message files.

          <li>The new option <code>gnus-gcc-mark-as-read</code> automatically marks
Gcc articles as read.

          <li>Externalizing of attachments

          <p>If <code>gnus-gcc-externalize-attachments</code> or
<code>message-fcc-externalize-attachments</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, attach
local files as external parts.

          <li>The envelope sender address can be customized when using Sendmail. 
See <a href="../message/Mail-Variables.html#Mail-Variables">Mail Variables</a>.

          <li>Gnus no longer generate the Sender: header automatically.

          <p>Earlier it was generated when the user configurable email address was
different from the Gnus guessed default user address.  As the guessing
algorithm is rarely correct these days, and (more controversially) the
only use of the Sender: header was to check if you are entitled to
cancel/supersede news (which is now solved by Cancel Locks instead,
see another entry), generation of the header has been disabled by
default.  See the variables <code>message-required-headers</code>,
<code>message-required-news-headers</code>, and
<code>message-required-mail-headers</code>.

          <li>Features from third party <samp><span class="file">message-utils.el</span></samp> added to <samp><span class="file">message.el</span></samp>.

          <p>Message now asks if you wish to remove &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(was: &lt;old subject&gt;)</span></samp>&rsquo; from
subject lines (see <code>message-subject-trailing-was-query</code>).  <kbd>C-c
M-m</kbd> and <kbd>C-c M-f</kbd> inserts markers indicating included text. 
<kbd>C-c C-f a</kbd> adds a X-No-Archive: header.  <kbd>C-c C-f x</kbd> inserts
appropriate headers and a note in the body for cross-postings and
followups (see the variables <code>message-cross-post-</code><var>*</var>).

          <li>References and X-Draft-From headers are no longer generated when you
start composing messages and <code>message-generate-headers-first</code> is
<code>nil</code>.

          <li>Easy inclusion of X-Faces headers.  See <a href="X_002dFace.html#X_002dFace">X-Face</a>.

          <li>Group Carbon Copy (GCC) quoting

          <p>To support groups that contains SPC and other weird characters, groups
are quoted before they are placed in the Gcc: header.  This means
variables such as <code>gnus-message-archive-group</code> should no longer
contain quote characters to make groups containing SPC work.  Also, if
you are using the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nnml:foo, nnml:bar</span></samp>&rsquo; (indicating Gcc
into two groups) you must change it to return the list
<code>("nnml:foo" "nnml:bar")</code>, otherwise the Gcc: line will be quoted
incorrectly.  Note that returning the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nnml:foo, nnml:bar</span></samp>&rsquo;
was incorrect earlier, it just didn't generate any problems since it
was inserted directly.

          <li><code>message-insinuate-rmail</code>

          <!-- FIXME should that not be 'message-user-agent? -->
          <p>Adding <code>(message-insinuate-rmail)</code> and <code>(setq
mail-user-agent 'gnus-user-agent)</code> in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> convinces Rmail to
compose, reply and forward messages in message-mode, where you can
enjoy the power of <acronym>MML</acronym>.

          <li><code>message-minibuffer-local-map</code>

          <p>The line below enables BBDB in resending a message:
          <pre class="lisp">               (define-key message-minibuffer-local-map [(tab)]
                 'bbdb-complete-name)
</pre>
          <li><code>gnus-posting-styles</code>

          <p>Add a new format of match like
          <pre class="lisp">               ((header "to" "larsi.*org")
                (Organization "Somewhere, Inc."))
</pre>
          <p>The old format like the lines below is obsolete, but still accepted.
          <pre class="lisp">               (header "to" "larsi.*org"
                       (Organization "Somewhere, Inc."))
</pre>
          <li><code>message-ignored-news-headers</code> and <code>message-ignored-mail-headers</code>

          <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X-Draft-From</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X-Gnus-Agent-Meta-Information</span></samp>&rsquo; have been
added into these two variables.  If you customized those, perhaps you
need add those two headers too.

          <li>Gnus supports the &ldquo;format=flowed&rdquo; (RFC 2646) parameter.  On
composing messages, it is enabled by <code>use-hard-newlines</code>. 
Decoding format=flowed was present but not documented in earlier
versions.

          <li>The option <code>mm-fill-flowed</code> can be used to disable treatment of
&ldquo;format=flowed&rdquo; messages.  Also, flowed text is disabled when sending
inline PGP signed messages.  See <a href="../emacs-mime/Flowed-text.html#Flowed-text">Flowed text</a>.  (New in Gnus 5.10.7)
<!-- This entry is also present in the node "No Gnus". -->

          <li>Gnus supports the generation of RFC 2298 Disposition Notification requests.

          <p>This is invoked with the <kbd>C-c M-n</kbd> key binding from message mode.

          <li>Message supports the Importance: (RFC 2156) header.

          <p>In the message buffer, <kbd>C-c C-f C-i</kbd> or <kbd>C-c C-u</kbd> cycles through
the valid values.

          <li>Gnus supports Cancel Locks in News.

          <p>This means a header &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Cancel-Lock</span></samp>&rsquo; is inserted in news posting.  It is
used to determine if you wrote an article or not (for canceling and
superseding).  Gnus generates a random password string the first time
you post a message, and saves it in your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> using the Custom
system.  While the variable is called <code>canlock-password</code>, it is not
security sensitive data.  Publishing your canlock string on the web
will not allow anyone to be able to anything she could not already do. 
The behavior can be changed by customizing <code>message-insert-canlock</code>.

          <li>Gnus supports <acronym>PGP</acronym> (RFC 1991/2440), <acronym>PGP/MIME</acronym> (RFC
2015/3156) and <acronym>S/MIME</acronym> (RFC 2630-2633).

          <p>It needs an external <acronym>S/MIME</acronym> and OpenPGP implementation, but no
additional Lisp libraries.  This add several menu items to the
Attachments menu, and <kbd>C-c RET</kbd> key bindings, when composing
messages.  This also obsoletes <code>gnus-article-hide-pgp-hook</code>.

          <li><acronym>MML</acronym> (Mime compose) prefix changed from <kbd>M-m</kbd> to <kbd>C-c
C-m</kbd>.

          <p>This change was made to avoid conflict with the standard binding of
<code>back-to-indentation</code>, which is also useful in message mode.

          <li>The default for <code>message-forward-show-mml</code> changed to the symbol
<code>best</code>.

          <p>The behavior for the <code>best</code> value is to show <acronym>MML</acronym> (i.e.,
convert to <acronym>MIME</acronym>) when appropriate.  <acronym>MML</acronym> will not be
used when forwarding signed or encrypted messages, as the conversion
invalidate the digital signature.

          <li>If <code>auto-compression-mode</code> is enabled, attachments are automatically
decompressed when activated. 
<!-- FIXME: Does this affect article or message mode? -->

          <li>Support for non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> domain names

          <p>Message supports non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> domain names in From:, To: and
Cc: and will query you whether to perform encoding when you try to
send a message.  The variable <code>message-use-idna</code> controls this. 
Gnus will also decode non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> domain names in From:, To:
and Cc: when you view a message.  The variable <code>gnus-use-idna</code>
controls this.

          <li>You can now drag and drop attachments to the Message buffer. 
See <code>mml-dnd-protocol-alist</code> and <code>mml-dnd-attach-options</code>. 
See <a href="../message/MIME.html#MIME">MIME</a>. 
<!-- New in 5.10.9 / 5.11 (Emacs 22.1) -->

          <li><code>auto-fill-mode</code> is enabled by default in Message mode. 
See <code>message-fill-column</code>.  See <a href="../message/Various-Message-Variables.html#Various-Message-Variables">Message Headers</a>. 
<!-- New in Gnus 5.10.12 / 5.11 (Emacs 22.3) -->

     </ul>

     <li>Changes in back ends
<!-- *********************** -->

          <ul>
<li>Gnus can display RSS newsfeeds as a newsgroup.  See <a href="RSS.html#RSS">RSS</a>.

          <li>The nndoc back end now supports mailman digests and exim bounces.

          <li>Gnus supports Maildir groups.

          <p>Gnus includes a new back end <samp><span class="file">nnmaildir.el</span></samp>.  See <a href="Maildir.html#Maildir">Maildir</a>.

          <li>The nnml and nnfolder back ends store marks for each groups.

          <p>This makes it possible to take backup of nnml/nnfolder servers/groups
separately of <samp><span class="file">~/.newsrc.eld</span></samp>, while preserving marks.  It also
makes it possible to share articles and marks between users (without
sharing the <samp><span class="file">~/.newsrc.eld</span></samp> file) within e.g. a department.  It
works by storing the marks stored in <samp><span class="file">~/.newsrc.eld</span></samp> in a per-group
file <samp><span class="file">.marks</span></samp> (for nnml) and <samp><var>groupname</var><span class="file">.mrk</span></samp> (for
nnfolder, named <var>groupname</var>).  If the nnml/nnfolder is moved to
another machine, Gnus will automatically use the <samp><span class="file">.marks</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">.mrk</span></samp> file instead of the information in <samp><span class="file">~/.newsrc.eld</span></samp>. 
The new server variables <code>nnml-marks-is-evil</code> and
<code>nnfolder-marks-is-evil</code> can be used to disable this feature.

     </ul>

     <li>Appearance
<!-- ************* -->

          <ul>
<li>The menu bar item (in Group and Summary buffer) named &ldquo;Misc&rdquo; has
been renamed to &ldquo;Gnus&rdquo;.

          <li>The menu bar item (in Message mode) named &ldquo;<acronym>MML</acronym>&rdquo; has been
renamed to &ldquo;Attachments&rdquo;.  Note that this menu also contains security
related stuff, like signing and encryption (see <a href="../message/Security.html#Security">Security</a>).

          <li>The tool bars have been updated to use GNOME icons in Group, Summary and
Message mode.  You can also customize the tool bars: <kbd>M-x
customize-apropos RET -tool-bar$</kbd> should get you started.  This is a new
feature in Gnus 5.10.10.  (Only for Emacs, not in XEmacs.)

          <li>The tool bar icons are now (de)activated correctly
in the group buffer, see the variable <code>gnus-group-update-tool-bar</code>. 
Its default value depends on your Emacs version.  This is a new feature
in Gnus 5.10.9. 
</ul>

     <li>Miscellaneous changes
<!-- ************************ -->

          <ul>
<li><code>gnus-agent</code>

          <p>The Gnus Agent has seen a major updated and is now enabled by default,
and all nntp and nnimap servers from <code>gnus-select-method</code> and
<code>gnus-secondary-select-method</code> are agentized by default.  Earlier
only the server in <code>gnus-select-method</code> was agentized by the
default, and the agent was disabled by default.  When the agent is
enabled, headers are now also retrieved from the Agent cache instead
of the back ends when possible.  Earlier this only happened in the
unplugged state.  You can enroll or remove servers with <kbd>J a</kbd> and
<kbd>J r</kbd> in the server buffer.  Gnus will not download articles into
the Agent cache, unless you instruct it to do so, though, by using
<kbd>J u</kbd> or <kbd>J s</kbd> from the Group buffer.  You revert to the old
behavior of having the Agent disabled with <code>(setq gnus-agent
nil)</code>.  Note that putting <code>(gnus-agentize)</code> in <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp>
is not needed any more.

          <li>Gnus reads the <acronym>NOV</acronym> and articles in the Agent if plugged.

          <p>If one reads an article while plugged, and the article already exists
in the Agent, it won't get downloaded once more.  <code>(setq
gnus-agent-cache nil)</code> reverts to the old behavior.

          <li>Dired integration

          <p><code>gnus-dired-minor-mode</code> (see <a href="Other-modes.html#Other-modes">Other modes</a>) installs key
bindings in dired buffers to send a file as an attachment, open a file
using the appropriate mailcap entry, and print a file using the mailcap
entry.

          <li>The format spec <code>%C</code> for positioning point has changed to <code>%*</code>.

          <li><code>gnus-slave-unplugged</code>

          <p>A new command which starts Gnus offline in slave mode.

     </ul>
