<h4 class="subheading">Introduction</h4>

<p>This is the Gnus Frequently Asked Questions list.

   <p>Gnus is a Usenet Newsreader and Electronic Mail User Agent implemented
as a part of Emacs. It's been around in some form for almost a decade
now, and has been distributed as a standard part of Emacs for much of
that time. Gnus 5 is the latest (and greatest) incarnation. The
original version was called GNUS, and was written by Masanobu UMEDA. 
When autumn crept up in '94, Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen grew bored and
decided to rewrite Gnus.

   <p>Its biggest strength is the fact that it is extremely
customizable. It is somewhat intimidating at first glance, but
most of the complexity can be ignored until you're ready to take
advantage of it. If you receive a reasonable volume of e-mail
(you're on various mailing lists), or you would like to read
high-volume mailing lists but cannot keep up with them, or read
high volume newsgroups or are just bored, then Gnus is what you
want.

   <p>This FAQ was maintained by Justin Sheehy until March 2002. He
would like to thank Steve Baur and Per Abrahamsen for doing a wonderful
job with this FAQ before him. We would like to do the same - thanks,
Justin!

   <p>If you have a Web browser, the official hypertext version is at:
<a href="http://my.gnus.org/FAQ/">http://my.gnus.org/FAQ/</a>. 
This version is much nicer than the unofficial hypertext
versions that are archived at Utrecht, Oxford, Smart Pages, Ohio
State, and other FAQ archives. See the resources question below
if you want information on obtaining it in another format.

   <p>The information contained here was compiled with the assistance
of the Gnus development mailing list, and any errors or
misprints are the my.gnus.org team's fault, sorry.
