  First of all, you should know that there is a special buffer
  called <code>*Server*</code> that lists all the servers Gnus
  knows about. You can press <kbd>^</kbd> from the Group buffer to
  see it. In the Server buffer, you can press <kbd>RET</kbd> on a
  defined server to see all the groups it serves (subscribed or
  not!). You can also add or delete servers, edit a foreign
  server's definition, agentize or de-agentize a server, and do
  many other neat things. See <a href=
  "Server-Buffer.html#Server-Buffer">Server Buffer</a>. See
  <a href="Foreign-Groups.html#Foreign-Groups">Foreign Groups</a>.
  See <a href="Agent-Basics.html#Agent-Basics">Agent
  Basics</a>.</p>

  The <code>gnus-select-method</code> variable says where Gnus
  should look for news. This variable should be a list where the
  first element says <dfn>how</dfn> and the second element says
  <dfn>where</dfn>. This method is your native method. All groups
  not fetched with this method are foreign groups.</p>

  <p>For instance, if the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">news.somewhere.edu</span></samp>&rsquo;
  <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server is where you want to get your
  daily dosage of news from, you'd say:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "news.somewhere.edu"))
</pre>

  <p>If you want to read directly from the local spool, say:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq gnus-select-method '(nnspool ""))
</pre>

  <p>If you can use a local spool, you probably should, as it will
  almost certainly be much faster. But do not use the local spool
  if your server is running Leafnode (which is a simple, standalone
  private news server); in this case, use <code>(nntp
  "localhost")</code>.</p>

  <p><a name="index-gnus_002dnntpserver_002dfile-8" id=
  "index-gnus_002dnntpserver_002dfile-8"></a><a name=

  "index-g_t_0040acronym_007bNNTP_007d-server-10"></a>If this
  variable is not set, Gnus will take a look at the
  <samp><span class="env">NNTPSERVER</span></samp> environment
  variable. If that variable isn't set, Gnus will see whether
  <code>gnus-nntpserver-file</code> (<samp><span class=
  "file">/etc/nntpserver</span></samp> by default) has any opinions
  on the matter. If that fails as well, Gnus will try to use the
  machine running Emacs as an <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server.
  That's a long shot, though.</p>

  id="index-B-_0028Group_0029-12"></a>However, if you use one
  <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server regularly and are just interested
  in a couple of groups from a different server, you would be
  better served by using the <kbd>B</kbd> command in the group
  buffer. It will let you have a look at what groups are available,
  and you can subscribe to any of the groups you want to. This also
  makes <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> maintenance
  much tidier. See <a href=
  "Foreign-Groups.html#Foreign-Groups">Foreign Groups</a>.</p>

  <!-- @head -->
  A slightly different approach to foreign groups is to set the
  <code>gnus-secondary-select-methods</code> variable. The select
  methods listed in this variable are in many ways just as native
  as the <code>gnus-select-method</code> server. They will also be
  queried for active files during startup (if that's required), and
  new newsgroups that appear on these servers will be subscribed
  (or not) just as native groups are.</p>

  <p>For instance, if you use the <code>nnmbox</code> back end to
  read your mail, you would typically set this variable to</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnmbox "")))
</pre>

  <p>Note: the <acronym>NNTP</acronym> back end stores marks in
  marks files (see <a href="NNTP-marks.html#NNTP-marks">NNTP
  marks</a>). This feature makes it easy to share marks between
  several Gnus installations, but may slow down things a bit when
  fetching new articles. See <a href=
  "NNTP-marks.html#NNTP-marks">NNTP marks</a>, for more
  information.</p>
