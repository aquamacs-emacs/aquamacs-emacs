<h3 class="section">1.1 Finding the News</h3>

<p><a name="index-finding-news-6"></a>
<a name="index-gnus_002dselect_002dmethod-7"></a><!-- @head -->
The <code>gnus-select-method</code> variable says where Gnus should look for
news.  This variable should be a list where the first element says
<dfn>how</dfn> and the second element says <dfn>where</dfn>.  This method is your
native method.  All groups not fetched with this method are
foreign groups.

   <p>For instance, if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">news.somewhere.edu</span></samp>&rsquo; <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server is where
you want to get your daily dosage of news from, you'd say:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "news.somewhere.edu"))
</pre>
   <p>If you want to read directly from the local spool, say:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-select-method '(nnspool ""))
</pre>
   <p>If you can use a local spool, you probably should, as it will almost
certainly be much faster.  But do not use the local spool if your
server is running Leafnode (which is a simple, standalone private news
server); in this case, use <code>(nntp "localhost")</code>.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dnntpserver_002dfile-8"></a><a name="index-NNTPSERVER-9"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bNNTP_007d-server-10"></a>If this variable is not set, Gnus will take a look at the
<samp><span class="env">NNTPSERVER</span></samp> environment variable.  If that variable isn't set,
Gnus will see whether <code>gnus-nntpserver-file</code>
(<samp><span class="file">/etc/nntpserver</span></samp> by default) has any opinions on the matter. 
If that fails as well, Gnus will try to use the machine running Emacs
as an <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server.  That's a long shot, though.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dnntp_002dserver-11"></a>If <code>gnus-nntp-server</code> is set, this variable will override
<code>gnus-select-method</code>.  You should therefore set
<code>gnus-nntp-server</code> to <code>nil</code>, which is what it is by default.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsecondary_002dservers-12"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dnntp_002dserver-13"></a>You can also make Gnus prompt you interactively for the name of an
<acronym>NNTP</acronym> server.  If you give a non-numerical prefix to <code>gnus</code>
(i.e., <kbd>C-u M-x gnus</kbd>), Gnus will let you choose between the servers
in the <code>gnus-secondary-servers</code> list (if any).  You can also just
type in the name of any server you feel like visiting.  (Note that this
will set <code>gnus-nntp-server</code>, which means that if you then <kbd>M-x
gnus</kbd> later in the same Emacs session, Gnus will contact the same
server.)

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dgroup_002dbrowse_002dforeign_002dserver-14"></a><a name="index-B-_0028Group_0029-15"></a>However, if you use one <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server regularly and are just
interested in a couple of groups from a different server, you would be
better served by using the <kbd>B</kbd> command in the group buffer.  It will
let you have a look at what groups are available, and you can subscribe
to any of the groups you want to.  This also makes <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp>
maintenance much tidier.  See <a href="Foreign-Groups.html#Foreign-Groups">Foreign Groups</a>.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsecondary_002dselect_002dmethods-16"></a><!-- @head -->
A slightly different approach to foreign groups is to set the
<code>gnus-secondary-select-methods</code> variable.  The select methods
listed in this variable are in many ways just as native as the
<code>gnus-select-method</code> server.  They will also be queried for active
files during startup (if that's required), and new newsgroups that
appear on these servers will be subscribed (or not) just as native
groups are.

   <p>For instance, if you use the <code>nnmbox</code> back end to read your mail,
you would typically set this variable to

<pre class="lisp">     (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnmbox "")))
</pre>
   <p>Note: the <acronym>NNTP</acronym> back end stores marks in marks files
(see <a href="NNTP-marks.html#NNTP-marks">NNTP marks</a>).  This feature makes it easy to share marks between
several Gnus installations, but may slow down things a bit when fetching
new articles.  See <a href="NNTP-marks.html#NNTP-marks">NNTP marks</a>, for more information.
