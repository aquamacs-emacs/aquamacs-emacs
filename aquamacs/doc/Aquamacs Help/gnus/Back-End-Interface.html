<h4 class="subsection">10.7.2 Back End Interface</h4>

<p>Gnus doesn't know anything about <acronym>NNTP</acronym>, spools, mail or virtual
groups.  It only knows how to talk to <dfn>virtual servers</dfn>.  A virtual
server is a <dfn>back end</dfn> and some <dfn>back end variables</dfn>.  As examples
of the first, we have <code>nntp</code>, <code>nnspool</code> and <code>nnmbox</code>.  As
examples of the latter we have <code>nntp-port-number</code> and
<code>nnmbox-directory</code>.

   <p>When Gnus asks for information from a back end&mdash;say <code>nntp</code>&mdash;on
something, it will normally include a virtual server name in the
function parameters.  (If not, the back end should use the &ldquo;current&rdquo;
virtual server.)  For instance, <code>nntp-request-list</code> takes a virtual
server as its only (optional) parameter.  If this virtual server hasn't
been opened, the function should fail.

   <p>Note that a virtual server name has no relation to some physical server
name.  Take this example:

<pre class="lisp">     (nntp "odd-one"
           (nntp-address "ifi.uio.no")
           (nntp-port-number 4324))
</pre>
   <p>Here the virtual server name is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">odd-one</span></samp>&rsquo; while the name of
the physical server is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ifi.uio.no</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The back ends should be able to switch between several virtual servers. 
The standard back ends implement this by keeping an alist of virtual
server environments that they pull down/push up when needed.

   <p>There are two groups of interface functions: <dfn>required functions</dfn>,
which must be present, and <dfn>optional functions</dfn>, which Gnus will
always check for presence before attempting to call 'em.

   <p>All these functions are expected to return data in the buffer
<code>nntp-server-buffer</code> (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp"> *nntpd*</span></samp>&rsquo;), which is somewhat
unfortunately named, but we'll have to live with it.  When I talk about
<dfn>resulting data</dfn>, I always refer to the data in that buffer.  When I
talk about <dfn>return value</dfn>, I talk about the function value returned by
the function call.  Functions that fail should return <code>nil</code> as the
return value.

   <p>Some back ends could be said to be <dfn>server-forming</dfn> back ends, and
some might be said not to be.  The latter are back ends that generally
only operate on one group at a time, and have no concept of &ldquo;server&rdquo;
&mdash;they have a group, and they deliver info on that group and nothing
more.

   <p>Gnus identifies each message by way of group name and article number.  A
few remarks about these article numbers might be useful.  First of all,
the numbers are positive integers.  Secondly, it is normally not
possible for later articles to &ldquo;re-use&rdquo; older article numbers without
confusing Gnus.  That is, if a group has ever contained a message
numbered 42, then no other message may get that number, or Gnus will get
mightily confused.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Third, article numbers must be assigned in order of arrival in the
group; this is not necessarily the same as the date of the message.

   <p>The previous paragraph already mentions all the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; restrictions that
article numbers must fulfill.  But it seems that it might be useful to
assign <em>consecutive</em> article numbers, for Gnus gets quite confused
if there are holes in the article numbering sequence.  However, due to
the &ldquo;no-reuse&rdquo; restriction, holes cannot be avoided altogether.  It's
also useful for the article numbers to start at 1 to avoid running out
of numbers as long as possible.

   <p>Note that by convention, back ends are named <code>nnsomething</code>, but
Gnus also comes with some <code>nnnotbackends</code>, such as
<samp><span class="file">nnheader.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">nnmail.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">nnoo.el</span></samp>.

   <p>In the examples and definitions I will refer to the imaginary back end
<code>nnchoke</code>.
