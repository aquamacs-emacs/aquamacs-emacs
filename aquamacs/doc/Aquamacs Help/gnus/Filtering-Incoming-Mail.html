<h4 class="subsection">8.20.2 Filtering Incoming Mail</h4>

<p><a name="index-spam-filtering-2886"></a><a name="index-spam-filtering-incoming-mail-2887"></a><a name="index-spam-2888"></a>
To use the Spam package to filter incoming mail, you must first set up
fancy mail splitting.  See <a href="Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy Mail Splitting</a>.  The Spam package
defines a special splitting function that you can add to your fancy
split variable (either <code>nnmail-split-fancy</code> or
<code>nnimap-split-fancy</code>, depending on your mail back end):

<pre class="example">     (: spam-split)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-spam_002dsplit_002dgroup-2889"></a>The <code>spam-split</code> function scans incoming mail according to your
chosen spam back end(s), and sends messages identified as spam to a
spam group.  By default, the spam group is a group named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo;,
but you can change this by customizing <code>spam-split-group</code>.  Make
sure the contents of <code>spam-split-group</code> are an unqualified group
name.  For instance, in an <code>nnimap</code> server &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">your-server</span></samp>&rsquo;,
the value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo; means &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nnimap+your-server:spam</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The value
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nnimap+server:spam</span></samp>&rsquo; is therefore wrong&mdash;it gives the group
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nnimap+your-server:nnimap+server:spam</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><code>spam-split</code> does not modify the contents of messages in any way.

   <p><a name="index-nnimap_002dsplit_002ddownload_002dbody-2890"></a>Note for IMAP users: if you use the <code>spam-check-bogofilter</code>,
<code>spam-check-ifile</code>, and <code>spam-check-stat</code> spam back ends,
you should also set the variable <code>nnimap-split-download-body</code>
to <code>t</code>.  These spam back ends are most useful when they can
&ldquo;scan&rdquo; the full message body.  By default, the nnimap back end only
retrieves the message headers; <code>nnimap-split-download-body</code> tells
it to retrieve the message bodies as well.  We don't set this by
default because it will slow <acronym>IMAP</acronym> down, and that is not an
appropriate decision to make on behalf of the user.  See <a href="Splitting-in-IMAP.html#Splitting-in-IMAP">Splitting in IMAP</a>.

   <p>You have to specify one or more spam back ends for <code>spam-split</code>
to use, by setting the <code>spam-use-*</code> variables.  See <a href="Spam-Back-Ends.html#Spam-Back-Ends">Spam Back Ends</a>.  Normally, <code>spam-split</code> simply uses all the spam back ends
you enabled in this way.  However, you can tell <code>spam-split</code> to
use only some of them.  Why this is useful?  Suppose you are using the
<code>spam-use-regex-headers</code> and <code>spam-use-blackholes</code> spam back
ends, and the following split rule:

<pre class="example">      nnimap-split-fancy '(|
                           (any "ding" "ding")
                           (: spam-split)
                           ;; <span class="roman">default mailbox</span>
                           "mail")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The problem is that you want all ding messages to make it to the ding
folder.  But that will let obvious spam (for example, spam detected by
SpamAssassin, and <code>spam-use-regex-headers</code>) through, when it's
sent to the ding list.  On the other hand, some messages to the ding
list are from a mail server in the blackhole list, so the invocation
of <code>spam-split</code> can't be before the ding rule.

   <p>The solution is to let SpamAssassin headers supersede ding rules, and
perform the other <code>spam-split</code> rules (including a second
invocation of the regex-headers check) after the ding rule.  This is
done by passing a parameter to <code>spam-split</code>:

<pre class="example">     nnimap-split-fancy
           '(|
             ;; <span class="roman">spam detected by </span><code>spam-use-regex-headers</code><span class="roman"> goes to &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">regex-spam</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;</span>
             (: spam-split "regex-spam" 'spam-use-regex-headers)
             (any "ding" "ding")
             ;; <span class="roman">all other spam detected by spam-split goes to </span><code>spam-split-group</code>
             (: spam-split)
             ;; <span class="roman">default mailbox</span>
             "mail")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This lets you invoke specific <code>spam-split</code> checks depending on
your particular needs, and target the results of those checks to a
particular spam group.  You don't have to throw all mail into all the
spam tests.  Another reason why this is nice is that messages to
mailing lists you have rules for don't have to have resource-intensive
blackhole checks performed on them.  You could also specify different
spam checks for your nnmail split vs. your nnimap split.  Go crazy.

   <p>You should set the <code>spam-use-*</code> variables for whatever spam back
ends you intend to use.  The reason is that when loading
<samp><span class="file">spam.el</span></samp>, some conditional loading is done depending on what
<code>spam-use-xyz</code> variables you have set.  See <a href="Spam-Back-Ends.html#Spam-Back-Ends">Spam Back Ends</a>.

<!-- @emph{TODO: spam.el needs to provide a uniform way of training all the -->
<!-- statistical databases.  Some have that functionality built-in, others -->
