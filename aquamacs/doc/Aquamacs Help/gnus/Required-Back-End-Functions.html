<h5 class="subsubsection">10.7.2.1 Required Back End Functions</h5>

     <dl>
<dt><code>(nnchoke-retrieve-headers ARTICLES &amp;optional GROUP SERVER FETCH-OLD)</code><dd>
<var>articles</var> is either a range of article numbers or a list of
<code>Message-ID</code>s.  Current back ends do not fully support either&mdash;only
sequences (lists) of article numbers, and most back ends do not support
retrieval of <code>Message-ID</code>s.  But they should try for both.

     <p>The result data should either be HEADs or <acronym>NOV</acronym> lines, and the result
value should either be <code>headers</code> or <code>nov</code> to reflect this. 
This might later be expanded to <code>various</code>, which will be a mixture
of HEADs and <acronym>NOV</acronym> lines, but this is currently not supported by Gnus.

     <p>If <var>fetch-old</var> is non-<code>nil</code> it says to try fetching &ldquo;extra
headers&rdquo;, in some meaning of the word.  This is generally done by
fetching (at most) <var>fetch-old</var> extra headers less than the smallest
article number in <code>articles</code>, and filling the gaps as well.  The
presence of this parameter can be ignored if the back end finds it
cumbersome to follow the request.  If this is non-<code>nil</code> and not a
number, do maximum fetches.

     <p>Here's an example HEAD:

     <pre class="example">          221 1056 Article retrieved.
          Path: ifi.uio.no!sturles
          From: sturles@ifi.uio.no (Sturle Sunde)
          Newsgroups: ifi.discussion
          Subject: Re: Something very droll
          Date: 27 Oct 1994 14:02:57 +0100
          Organization: Dept. of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway
          Lines: 26
          Message-ID: &lt;38o8e1$a0o@holmenkollen.ifi.uio.no&gt;
          References: &lt;38jdmq$4qu@visbur.ifi.uio.no&gt;
          NNTP-Posting-Host: holmenkollen.ifi.uio.no
          .
</pre>
     <p>So a <code>headers</code> return value would imply that there's a number of
these in the data buffer.

     <p>Here's a BNF definition of such a buffer:

     <pre class="example">          headers        = *head
          head           = error / valid-head
          error-message  = [ "4" / "5" ] 2number " " &lt;error message&gt; eol
          valid-head     = valid-message *header "." eol
          valid-message  = "221 " &lt;number&gt; " Article retrieved." eol
          header         = &lt;text&gt; eol
</pre>
     <p><a name="index-BNF-3185"></a>(The version of BNF used here is the one used in RFC822.)

     <p>If the return value is <code>nov</code>, the data buffer should contain
<dfn>network overview database</dfn> lines.  These are basically fields
separated by tabs.

     <pre class="example">          nov-buffer = *nov-line
          nov-line   = field 7*8[ &lt;TAB&gt; field ] eol
          field      = &lt;text except TAB&gt;
</pre>
     <p>For a closer look at what should be in those fields,
see <a href="Headers.html#Headers">Headers</a>.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-open-server SERVER &amp;optional DEFINITIONS)</code><dd>
<var>server</var> is here the virtual server name.  <var>definitions</var> is a
list of <code>(VARIABLE VALUE)</code> pairs that define this virtual server.

     <p>If the server can't be opened, no error should be signaled.  The back end
may then choose to refuse further attempts at connecting to this
server.  In fact, it should do so.

     <p>If the server is opened already, this function should return a
non-<code>nil</code> value.  There should be no data returned.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-close-server &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
Close connection to <var>server</var> and free all resources connected
to it.  Return <code>nil</code> if the server couldn't be closed for some
reason.

     <p>There should be no data returned.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-close)</code><dd>
Close connection to all servers and free all resources that the back end
have reserved.  All buffers that have been created by that back end
should be killed.  (Not the <code>nntp-server-buffer</code>, though.)  This
function is generally only called when Gnus is shutting down.

     <p>There should be no data returned.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-server-opened &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
If <var>server</var> is the current virtual server, and the connection to the
physical server is alive, then this function should return a
non-<code>nil</code> value.  This function should under no circumstances
attempt to reconnect to a server we have lost connection to.

     <p>There should be no data returned.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-status-message &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
This function should return the last error message from <var>server</var>.

     <p>There should be no data returned.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-article ARTICLE &amp;optional GROUP SERVER TO-BUFFER)</code><dd>
The result data from this function should be the article specified by
<var>article</var>.  This might either be a <code>Message-ID</code> or a number. 
It is optional whether to implement retrieval by <code>Message-ID</code>, but
it would be nice if that were possible.

     <p>If <var>to-buffer</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the result data should be returned
in this buffer instead of the normal data buffer.  This is to make it
possible to avoid copying large amounts of data from one buffer to
another, while Gnus mainly requests articles to be inserted directly
into its article buffer.

     <p>If it is at all possible, this function should return a cons cell where
the <code>car</code> is the group name the article was fetched from, and the <code>cdr</code> is
the article number.  This will enable Gnus to find out what the real
group and article numbers are when fetching articles by
<code>Message-ID</code>.  If this isn't possible, <code>t</code> should be returned
on successful article retrieval.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-group GROUP &amp;optional SERVER FAST)</code><dd>
Get data on <var>group</var>.  This function also has the side effect of
making <var>group</var> the current group.

     <p>If <var>fast</var>, don't bother to return useful data, just make <var>group</var>
the current group.

     <p>Here's an example of some result data and a definition of the same:

     <pre class="example">          211 56 1000 1059 ifi.discussion
</pre>
     <p>The first number is the status, which should be 211.  Next is the
total number of articles in the group, the lowest article number, the
highest article number, and finally the group name.  Note that the total
number of articles may be less than one might think while just
considering the highest and lowest article numbers, but some articles
may have been canceled.  Gnus just discards the total-number, so
whether one should take the bother to generate it properly (if that is a
problem) is left as an exercise to the reader.  If the group contains no
articles, the lowest article number should be reported as 1 and the
highest as 0.

     <pre class="example">          group-status = [ error / info ] eol
          error        = [ "4" / "5" ] 2&lt;number&gt; " " &lt;Error message&gt;
          info         = "211 " 3* [ &lt;number&gt; " " ] &lt;string&gt;
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-close-group GROUP &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
Close <var>group</var> and free any resources connected to it.  This will be
a no-op on most back ends.

     <p>There should be no data returned.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-list &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
Return a list of all groups available on <var>server</var>.  And that means
<em>all</em>.

     <p>Here's an example from a server that only carries two groups:

     <pre class="example">          ifi.test 0000002200 0000002000 y
          ifi.discussion 3324 3300 n
</pre>
     <p>On each line we have a group name, then the highest article number in
that group, the lowest article number, and finally a flag.  If the group
contains no articles, the lowest article number should be reported as 1
and the highest as 0.

     <pre class="example">          active-file = *active-line
          active-line = name " " &lt;number&gt; " " &lt;number&gt; " " flags eol
          name        = &lt;string&gt;
          flags       = "n" / "y" / "m" / "x" / "j" / "=" name
</pre>
     <p>The flag says whether the group is read-only (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;), is moderated
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo;), is dead (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;), is aliased to some other group
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=other-group</span></samp>&rsquo;) or none of the above (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;).

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-post &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
This function should post the current buffer.  It might return whether
the posting was successful or not, but that's not required.  If, for
instance, the posting is done asynchronously, it has generally not been
completed by the time this function concludes.  In that case, this
function should set up some kind of sentinel to beep the user loud and
clear if the posting could not be completed.

     <p>There should be no result data from this function.
