<h5 class="subsubsection">2.18.2.1 About mairix</h5>

<p>Mairix is a tool for indexing and searching words in locally stored
mail.  It was written by Richard Curnow and is licensed under the
GPL.  Mairix comes with most popular GNU/Linux distributions, but it also
runs under Windows (with cygwin), Mac OS X and Solaris.  The homepage can
be found at
<a href="http://www.rpcurnow.force9.co.uk/mairix/index.html">http://www.rpcurnow.force9.co.uk/mairix/index.html</a>

   <p>Though mairix might not be as flexible as other search tools like
swish++ or namazu, which you can use via the <code>nnir</code> back end, it
has the prime advantage of being incredibly fast.  On current systems, it
can easily search through headers and message bodies of thousands and
thousands of mails in well under a second.  Building the database
necessary for searching might take a minute or two, but only has to be
done once fully.  Afterwards, the updates are done incrementally and
therefore are really fast, too.  Additionally, mairix is very easy to set
up.

   <p>For maximum speed though, mairix should be used with mails stored in
<code>Maildir</code> or <code>MH</code> format (this includes the <code>nnml</code> back
end), although it also works with mbox.  Mairix presents the search
results by populating a <em>virtual</em> maildir/MH folder with symlinks
which point to the &ldquo;real&rdquo; message files (if mbox is used, copies are
made).  Since mairix already presents search results in such a virtual
mail folder, it is very well suited for using it as an external program
for creating <em>smart</em> mail folders, which represent certain mail
searches.  This is similar to a Kiboze group (see <a href="Kibozed-Groups.html#Kibozed-Groups">Kibozed Groups</a>),
but much faster.
