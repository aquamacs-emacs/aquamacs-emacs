<h5 class="subsubsection">10.7.2.2 Optional Back End Functions</h5>

     <dl>
<dt><code>(nnchoke-retrieve-groups GROUPS &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
<var>groups</var> is a list of groups, and this function should request data
on all those groups.  How it does it is of no concern to Gnus, but it
should attempt to do this in a speedy fashion.

     <p>The return value of this function can be either <code>active</code> or
<code>group</code>, which says what the format of the result data is.  The
former is in the same format as the data from
<code>nnchoke-request-list</code>, while the latter is a buffer full of lines
in the same format as <code>nnchoke-request-group</code> gives.

     <pre class="example">          group-buffer = *active-line / *group-status
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-update-info GROUP INFO &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
A Gnus group info (see <a href="Group-Info.html#Group-Info">Group Info</a>) is handed to the back end for
alterations.  This comes in handy if the back end really carries all
the information (as is the case with virtual and imap groups).  This
function should destructively alter the info to suit its needs, and
should return a non-<code>nil</code> value (exceptionally,
<code>nntp-request-update-info</code> always returns <code>nil</code> not to waste
the network resources).

     <p>There should be no result data from this function.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-type GROUP &amp;optional ARTICLE)</code><dd>
When the user issues commands for &ldquo;sending news&rdquo; (<kbd>F</kbd> in the
summary buffer, for instance), Gnus has to know whether the article the
user is following up on is news or mail.  This function should return
<code>news</code> if <var>article</var> in <var>group</var> is news, <code>mail</code> if it
is mail and <code>unknown</code> if the type can't be decided.  (The
<var>article</var> parameter is necessary in <code>nnvirtual</code> groups which
might very well combine mail groups and news groups.)  Both <var>group</var>
and <var>article</var> may be <code>nil</code>.

     <p>There should be no result data from this function.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-set-mark GROUP ACTION &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
Set/remove/add marks on articles.  Normally Gnus handles the article
marks (such as read, ticked, expired etc) internally, and store them in
<samp><span class="file">~/.newsrc.eld</span></samp>.  Some back ends (such as <acronym>IMAP</acronym>) however carry
all information about the articles on the server, so Gnus need to
propagate the mark information to the server.

     <p><var>action</var> is a list of mark setting requests, having this format:

     <pre class="example">          (RANGE ACTION MARK)
</pre>
     <p><var>range</var> is a range of articles you wish to update marks on. 
<var>action</var> is <code>add</code> or <code>del</code>, used to add marks or remove
marks (preserving all marks not mentioned).  <var>mark</var> is a list of
marks; where each mark is a symbol.  Currently used marks are
<code>read</code>, <code>tick</code>, <code>reply</code>, <code>expire</code>, <code>killed</code>,
<code>dormant</code>, <code>save</code>, <code>download</code>, <code>unsend</code>,
<code>forward</code> and <code>recent</code>, but your back end should, if
possible, not limit itself to these.

     <p>Given contradictory actions, the last action in the list should be the
effective one.  That is, if your action contains a request to add the
<code>tick</code> mark on article 1 and, later in the list, a request to
remove the mark on the same article, the mark should in fact be removed.

     <p>An example action list:

     <pre class="example">          (((5 12 30) 'del '(tick))
           ((10 . 90) 'add '(read expire))
           ((92 94) 'del '(read)))
</pre>
     <p>The function should return a range of articles it wasn't able to set the
mark on (currently not used for anything).

     <p>There should be no result data from this function.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-update-mark GROUP ARTICLE MARK)</code><dd>
If the user tries to set a mark that the back end doesn't like, this
function may change the mark.  Gnus will use whatever this function
returns as the mark for <var>article</var> instead of the original
<var>mark</var>.  If the back end doesn't care, it must return the original
<var>mark</var>, and not <code>nil</code> or any other type of garbage.

     <p>The only use for this I can see is what <code>nnvirtual</code> does with
it&mdash;if a component group is auto-expirable, marking an article as read
in the virtual group should result in the article being marked as
expirable.

     <p>There should be no result data from this function.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-scan &amp;optional GROUP SERVER)</code><dd>
This function may be called at any time (by Gnus or anything else) to
request that the back end check for incoming articles, in one way or
another.  A mail back end will typically read the spool file or query
the <acronym>POP</acronym> server when this function is invoked.  The
<var>group</var> doesn't have to be heeded&mdash;if the back end decides that
it is too much work just scanning for a single group, it may do a
total scan of all groups.  It would be nice, however, to keep things
local if that's practical.

     <p>There should be no result data from this function.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-group-description GROUP &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
The result data from this function should be a description of
<var>group</var>.

     <pre class="example">          description-line = name &lt;TAB&gt; description eol
          name             = &lt;string&gt;
          description      = &lt;text&gt;
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-list-newsgroups &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
The result data from this function should be the description of all
groups available on the server.

     <pre class="example">          description-buffer = *description-line
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-newgroups DATE &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
The result data from this function should be all groups that were
created after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">date</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is in normal human-readable date format
(i.e., the date format used in mail and news headers, and returned by
the function <code>message-make-date</code> by default).  The data should be
in the active buffer format.

     <p>It is okay for this function to return &ldquo;too many&rdquo; groups; some back ends
might find it cheaper to return the full list of groups, rather than
just the new groups.  But don't do this for back ends with many groups. 
Normally, if the user creates the groups herself, there won't be too
many groups, so <code>nnml</code> and the like are probably safe.  But for
back ends like <code>nntp</code>, where the groups have been created by the
server, it is quite likely that there can be many groups.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-create-group GROUP &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
This function should create an empty group with name <var>group</var>.

     <p>There should be no return data.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-expire-articles ARTICLES &amp;optional GROUP SERVER FORCE)</code><dd>
This function should run the expiry process on all articles in the
<var>articles</var> range (which is currently a simple list of article
numbers.)  It is left up to the back end to decide how old articles
should be before they are removed by this function.  If <var>force</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, all <var>articles</var> should be deleted, no matter how new
they are.

     <p>This function should return a list of articles that it did not/was not
able to delete.

     <p>There should be no result data returned.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-move-article ARTICLE GROUP SERVER ACCEPT-FORM &amp;optional LAST)</code><dd>
This function should move <var>article</var> (which is a number) from
<var>group</var> by calling <var>accept-form</var>.

     <p>This function should ready the article in question for moving by
removing any header lines it has added to the article, and generally
should &ldquo;tidy up&rdquo; the article.  Then it should <code>eval</code>
<var>accept-form</var> in the buffer where the &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; article is.  This
will do the actual copying.  If this <code>eval</code> returns a
non-<code>nil</code> value, the article should be removed.

     <p>If <var>last</var> is <code>nil</code>, that means that there is a high likelihood
that there will be more requests issued shortly, so that allows some
optimizations.

     <p>The function should return a cons where the <code>car</code> is the group name and
the <code>cdr</code> is the article number that the article was entered as.

     <p>There should be no data returned.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-accept-article GROUP &amp;optional SERVER LAST)</code><dd>
This function takes the current buffer and inserts it into <var>group</var>. 
If <var>last</var> in <code>nil</code>, that means that there will be more calls to
this function in short order.

     <p>The function should return a cons where the <code>car</code> is the group name and
the <code>cdr</code> is the article number that the article was entered as.

     <p>The group should exist before the back end is asked to accept the
article for that group.

     <p>There should be no data returned.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-replace-article ARTICLE GROUP BUFFER)</code><dd>
This function should remove <var>article</var> (which is a number) from
<var>group</var> and insert <var>buffer</var> there instead.

     <p>There should be no data returned.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-delete-group GROUP FORCE &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
This function should delete <var>group</var>.  If <var>force</var>, it should
really delete all the articles in the group, and then delete the group
itself.  (If there is such a thing as &ldquo;the group itself&rdquo;.)

     <p>There should be no data returned.

     <br><dt><code>(nnchoke-request-rename-group GROUP NEW-NAME &amp;optional SERVER)</code><dd>
This function should rename <var>group</var> into <var>new-name</var>.  All
articles in <var>group</var> should move to <var>new-name</var>.

     <p>There should be no data returned.
