<h4 class="subsection">8.20.4 Spam and Ham Processors</h4>

<p><a name="index-spam-filtering-2891"></a><a name="index-spam-filtering-variables-2892"></a><a name="index-spam-variables-2893"></a><a name="index-spam-2894"></a>
<a name="index-gnus_002dspam_002dprocess_002dnewsgroups-2895"></a>Spam and ham processors specify special actions to take when you exit
a group buffer.  Spam processors act on spam messages, and ham
processors on ham messages.  At present, the main role of these
processors is to update the dictionaries of dictionary-based spam back
ends such as Bogofilter (see <a href="Bogofilter.html#Bogofilter">Bogofilter</a>) and the Spam Statistics
package (see <a href="Spam-Statistics-Filtering.html#Spam-Statistics-Filtering">Spam Statistics Filtering</a>).

   <p>The spam and ham processors that apply to each group are determined by
the group's<code>spam-process</code> group parameter.  If this group
parameter is not defined, they are determined by the variable
<code>gnus-spam-process-newsgroups</code>.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dspam_002dnewsgroup_002dcontents-2896"></a>Gnus learns from the spam you get.  You have to collect your spam in
one or more spam groups, and set or customize the variable
<code>spam-junk-mailgroups</code> as appropriate.  You can also declare
groups to contain spam by setting their group parameter
<code>spam-contents</code> to <code>gnus-group-spam-classification-spam</code>, or
by customizing the corresponding variable
<code>gnus-spam-newsgroup-contents</code>.  The <code>spam-contents</code> group
parameter and the <code>gnus-spam-newsgroup-contents</code> variable can
also be used to declare groups as <em>ham</em> groups if you set their
classification to <code>gnus-group-spam-classification-ham</code>.  If
groups are not classified by means of <code>spam-junk-mailgroups</code>,
<code>spam-contents</code>, or <code>gnus-spam-newsgroup-contents</code>, they are
considered <em>unclassified</em>.  All groups are unclassified by
default.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dspam_002dmark-2897"></a><a name="index-g_t_0024-2898"></a>In spam groups, all messages are considered to be spam by default:
they get the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; mark (<code>gnus-spam-mark</code>) when you enter the
group.  If you have seen a message, had it marked as spam, then
unmarked it, it won't be marked as spam when you enter the group
thereafter.  You can disable that behavior, so all unread messages
will get the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; mark, if you set the
<code>spam-mark-only-unseen-as-spam</code> parameter to <code>nil</code>.  You
should remove the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; mark when you are in the group summary
buffer for every message that is not spam after all.  To remove the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; mark, you can use <kbd>M-u</kbd> to &ldquo;unread&rdquo; the article, or
<kbd>d</kbd> for declaring it read the non-spam way.  When you leave a
group, all spam-marked (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;) articles are sent to a spam
processor which will study them as spam samples.

   <p>Messages may also be deleted in various other ways, and unless
<code>ham-marks</code> group parameter gets overridden below, marks &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; for default read or explicit delete, marks &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">K</span></samp>&rsquo; for automatic or explicit kills, as well as mark &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Y</span></samp>&rsquo; for
low scores, are all considered to be associated with articles which
are not spam.  This assumption might be false, in particular if you
use kill files or score files as means for detecting genuine spam, you
should then adjust the <code>ham-marks</code> group parameter.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>ham-marks</b><var><a name="index-ham_002dmarks-2899"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>You can customize this group or topic parameter to be the list of
marks you want to consider ham.  By default, the list contains the
deleted, read, killed, kill-filed, and low-score marks (the idea is
that these articles have been read, but are not spam).  It can be
useful to also include the tick mark in the ham marks.  It is not
recommended to make the unread mark a ham mark, because it normally
indicates a lack of classification.  But you can do it, and we'll be
happy for you. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>spam-marks</b><var><a name="index-spam_002dmarks-2900"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>You can customize this group or topic parameter to be the list of
marks you want to consider spam.  By default, the list contains only
the spam mark.  It is not recommended to change that, but you can if
you really want to. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>When you leave <em>any</em> group, regardless of its
<code>spam-contents</code> classification, all spam-marked articles are sent
to a spam processor, which will study these as spam samples.  If you
explicit kill a lot, you might sometimes end up with articles marked
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">K</span></samp>&rsquo; which you never saw, and which might accidentally contain
spam.  Best is to make sure that real spam is marked with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and nothing else.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dham_002dprocess_002ddestinations-2901"></a>When you leave a <em>spam</em> group, all spam-marked articles are
marked as expired after processing with the spam processor.  This is
not done for <em>unclassified</em> or <em>ham</em> groups.  Also, any
<strong>ham</strong> articles in a spam group will be moved to a location
determined by either the <code>ham-process-destination</code> group
parameter or a match in the <code>gnus-ham-process-destinations</code>
variable, which is a list of regular expressions matched with group
names (it's easiest to customize this variable with <kbd>M-x
customize-variable &lt;RET&gt; gnus-ham-process-destinations</kbd>).  Each
group name list is a standard Lisp list, if you prefer to customize
the variable manually.  If the <code>ham-process-destination</code>
parameter is not set, ham articles are left in place.  If the
<code>spam-mark-ham-unread-before-move-from-spam-group</code> parameter is
set, the ham articles are marked as unread before being moved.

   <p>If ham can not be moved&mdash;because of a read-only back end such as
<acronym>NNTP</acronym>, for example, it will be copied.

   <p>Note that you can use multiples destinations per group or regular
expression!  This enables you to send your ham to a regular mail
group and to a <em>ham training</em> group.

   <p>When you leave a <em>ham</em> group, all ham-marked articles are sent to
a ham processor, which will study these as non-spam samples.

   <p><a name="index-spam_002dprocess_002dham_002din_002dspam_002dgroups-2902"></a>By default the variable <code>spam-process-ham-in-spam-groups</code> is
<code>nil</code>.  Set it to <code>t</code> if you want ham found in spam groups
to be processed.  Normally this is not done, you are expected instead
to send your ham to a ham group and process it there.

   <p><a name="index-spam_002dprocess_002dham_002din_002dnonham_002dgroups-2903"></a>By default the variable <code>spam-process-ham-in-nonham-groups</code> is
<code>nil</code>.  Set it to <code>t</code> if you want ham found in non-ham (spam
or unclassified) groups to be processed.  Normally this is not done,
you are expected instead to send your ham to a ham group and process
it there.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dspam_002dprocess_002ddestinations-2904"></a>When you leave a <em>ham</em> or <em>unclassified</em> group, all
<strong>spam</strong> articles are moved to a location determined by either
the <code>spam-process-destination</code> group parameter or a match in the
<code>gnus-spam-process-destinations</code> variable, which is a list of
regular expressions matched with group names (it's easiest to
customize this variable with <kbd>M-x customize-variable &lt;RET&gt;
gnus-spam-process-destinations</kbd>).  Each group name list is a standard
Lisp list, if you prefer to customize the variable manually.  If the
<code>spam-process-destination</code> parameter is not set, the spam
articles are only expired.  The group name is fully qualified, meaning
that if you see &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nntp:servername</span></samp>&rsquo; before the group name in the
group buffer then you need it here as well.

   <p>If spam can not be moved&mdash;because of a read-only back end such as
<acronym>NNTP</acronym>, for example, it will be copied.

   <p>Note that you can use multiples destinations per group or regular
expression!  This enables you to send your spam to multiple <em>spam
training</em> groups.

   <p><a name="index-spam_002dlog_002dto_002dregistry-2905"></a>The problem with processing ham and spam is that Gnus doesn't track
this processing by default.  Enable the <code>spam-log-to-registry</code>
variable so <code>spam.el</code> will use <code>gnus-registry.el</code> to track
what articles have been processed, and avoid processing articles
multiple times.  Keep in mind that if you limit the number of registry
entries, this won't work as well as it does without a limit.

   <p><a name="index-spam_002dmark_002donly_002dunseen_002das_002dspam-2906"></a>Set this variable if you want only unseen articles in spam groups to
be marked as spam.  By default, it is set.  If you set it to
<code>nil</code>, unread articles will also be marked as spam.

   <p><a name="index-spam_002dmark_002dham_002dunread_002dbefore_002dmove_002dfrom_002dspam_002dgroup-2907"></a>Set this variable if you want ham to be unmarked before it is moved
out of the spam group.  This is very useful when you use something
like the tick mark &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; to mark ham&mdash;the article will be placed
in your <code>ham-process-destination</code>, unmarked as if it came fresh
from the mail server.

   <p><a name="index-spam_002dautodetect_002drecheck_002dmessages-2908"></a>When autodetecting spam, this variable tells <code>spam.el</code> whether
only unseen articles or all unread articles should be checked for
spam.  It is recommended that you leave it off.
