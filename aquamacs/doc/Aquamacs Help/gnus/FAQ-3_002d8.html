<h5 class="subsubheading">Question 3.8</h5>

<p>OK, reading news works now, but I want to be able to read my mail
with Gnus, too. How to do it?

<h5 class="subsubheading">Answer</h5>

<p>That's a bit harder since there are many possible sources
for mail, many possible ways for storing mail and many
different ways for sending mail. The most common cases are
these: 1: You want to read your mail from a pop3 server and
send them directly to a SMTP Server 2: Some program like
fetchmail retrieves your mail and stores it on disk from
where Gnus shall read it. Outgoing mail is sent by
Sendmail, Postfix or some other MTA. Sometimes, you even
need a combination of the above cases.

   <p>However, the first thing to do is to tell Gnus in which way
it should store the mail, in Gnus terminology which back end
to use. Gnus supports many different back ends, the most
commonly used one is nnml. It stores every mail in one file
and is therefor quite fast. However you might prefer a one
file per group approach if your file system has problems with
many small files, the nnfolder back end is then probably the
choice for you.  To use nnml add the following to ~/.gnus.el:

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnml ""))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As you might have guessed, if you want nnfolder, it's

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnfolder ""))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now we need to tell Gnus, where to get it's mail from. If
it's a POP3 server, then you need something like this:

<pre class="example">     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(pop :server "pop.YourProvider.net"
                                         :user "yourUserName"
                                         :password "yourPassword")))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Make sure ~/.gnus.el isn't readable to others if you store
your password there. If you want to read your mail from a
traditional spool file on your local machine, it's

<pre class="example">     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(file :path "/path/to/spool/file"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If it's a Maildir, with one file per message as used by
postfix, Qmail and (optionally) fetchmail it's

<pre class="example">     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(maildir :path "/path/to/Maildir/"
                                             :subdirs ("cur" "new")))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">And finally if you want to read your mail from several files
in one directory, for example because procmail already split your
mail, it's

<pre class="example">     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources
                     '(directory :path "/path/to/procmail-dir/"
                                 :suffix ".prcml")))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Where :suffix ".prcml" tells Gnus only to use files with the
suffix .prcml.

   <p>OK, now you only need to tell Gnus how to send mail. If you
want to send mail via sendmail (or whichever MTA is playing
the role of sendmail on your system), you don't need to do
anything. However, if you want to send your mail to an
SMTP Server you need the following in your ~/.gnus.el

<pre class="example">     (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     (setq smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.yourProvider.net")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">
