<h5 class="subsubsection">6.3.13.5 Maildir</h5>

<p><a name="index-nnmaildir-2258"></a><a name="index-maildir-2259"></a>
<code>nnmaildir</code> stores mail in the maildir format, with each maildir
corresponding to a group in Gnus.  This format is documented here:
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html">http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html</a> and here:
<a href="http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/maildir.html">http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/maildir.html</a>.  <code>nnmaildir</code>
also stores extra information in the <samp><span class="file">.nnmaildir/</span></samp> directory
within a maildir.

   <p>Maildir format was designed to allow concurrent deliveries and
reading, without needing locks.  With other back ends, you would have
your mail delivered to a spool of some kind, and then you would
configure Gnus to split mail from that spool into your groups.  You
can still do that with <code>nnmaildir</code>, but the more common
configuration is to have your mail delivered directly to the maildirs
that appear as group in Gnus.

   <p><code>nnmaildir</code> is designed to be perfectly reliable: <kbd>C-g</kbd> will
never corrupt its data in memory, and <code>SIGKILL</code> will never
corrupt its data in the filesystem.

   <p><code>nnmaildir</code> stores article marks and <acronym>NOV</acronym> data in each
maildir.  So you can copy a whole maildir from one Gnus setup to
another, and you will keep your marks.

   <p>Virtual server settings:

     <dl>
<dt><code>directory</code><dd>For each of your <code>nnmaildir</code> servers (it's very unlikely that
you'd need more than one), you need to create a directory and populate
it with maildirs or symlinks to maildirs (and nothing else; do not
choose a directory already used for other purposes).  Each maildir
will be represented in Gnus as a newsgroup on that server; the
filename of the symlink will be the name of the group.  Any filenames
in the directory starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; are ignored.  The directory is
scanned when you first start Gnus, and each time you type <kbd>g</kbd> in
the group buffer; if any maildirs have been removed or added,
<code>nnmaildir</code> notices at these times.

     <p>The value of the <code>directory</code> parameter should be a Lisp form
which is processed by <code>eval</code> and <code>expand-file-name</code> to get
the path of the directory for this server.  The form is <code>eval</code>ed
only when the server is opened; the resulting string is used until the
server is closed.  (If you don't know about forms and <code>eval</code>,
don't worry&mdash;a simple string will work.)  This parameter is not
optional; you must specify it.  I don't recommend using
<code>"~/Mail"</code> or a subdirectory of it; several other parts of Gnus
use that directory by default for various things, and may get confused
if <code>nnmaildir</code> uses it too.  <code>"~/.nnmaildir"</code> is a typical
value.

     <br><dt><code>target-prefix</code><dd>This should be a Lisp form which is processed by <code>eval</code> and
<code>expand-file-name</code>.  The form is <code>eval</code>ed only when the
server is opened; the resulting string is used until the server is
closed.

     <p>When you create a group on an <code>nnmaildir</code> server, the maildir is
created with <code>target-prefix</code> prepended to its name, and a symlink
pointing to that maildir is created, named with the plain group name. 
So if <code>directory</code> is <code>"~/.nnmaildir"</code> and
<code>target-prefix</code> is <code>"../maildirs/"</code>, then when you create
the group <code>foo</code>, <code>nnmaildir</code> will create
<samp><span class="file">~/.nnmaildir/../maildirs/foo</span></samp> as a maildir, and will create
<samp><span class="file">~/.nnmaildir/foo</span></samp> as a symlink pointing to
<samp><span class="file">../maildirs/foo</span></samp>.

     <p>You can set <code>target-prefix</code> to a string without any slashes to
create both maildirs and symlinks in the same <code>directory</code>; in
this case, any maildirs found in <code>directory</code> whose names start
with <code>target-prefix</code> will not be listed as groups (but the
symlinks pointing to them will be).

     <p>As a special case, if <code>target-prefix</code> is <code>""</code> (the default),
then when you create a group, the maildir will be created in
<code>directory</code> without a corresponding symlink.  Beware that you
cannot use <code>gnus-group-delete-group</code> on such groups without the
<code>force</code> argument.

     <br><dt><code>directory-files</code><dd>This should be a function with the same interface as
<code>directory-files</code> (such as <code>directory-files</code> itself).  It is
used to scan the server's <code>directory</code> for maildirs.  This
parameter is optional; the default is
<code>nnheader-directory-files-safe</code> if
<code>nnheader-directory-files-is-safe</code> is <code>nil</code>, and
<code>directory-files</code> otherwise. 
(<code>nnheader-directory-files-is-safe</code> is checked only once when the
server is opened; if you want to check it each time the directory is
scanned, you'll have to provide your own function that does that.)

     <br><dt><code>get-new-mail</code><dd>If non-<code>nil</code>, then after scanning for new mail in the group
maildirs themselves as usual, this server will also incorporate mail
the conventional Gnus way, from <code>mail-sources</code> according to
<code>nnmail-split-methods</code> or <code>nnmail-split-fancy</code>.  The default
value is <code>nil</code>.

     <p>Do <em>not</em> use the same maildir both in <code>mail-sources</code> and as
an <code>nnmaildir</code> group.  The results might happen to be useful, but
that would be by chance, not by design, and the results might be
different in the future.  If your split rules create new groups,
remember to supply a <code>create-directory</code> server parameter. 
</dl>

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.3.13.6 Group parameters</h5>

<p><code>nnmaildir</code> uses several group parameters.  It's safe to ignore
all this; the default behavior for <code>nnmaildir</code> is the same as the
default behavior for other mail back ends: articles are deleted after
one week, etc.  Except for the expiry parameters, all this
functionality is unique to <code>nnmaildir</code>, so you can ignore it if
you're just trying to duplicate the behavior you already have with
another back end.

   <p>If the value of any of these parameters is a vector, the first element
is evaluated as a Lisp form and the result is used, rather than the
original value.  If the value is not a vector, the value itself is
evaluated as a Lisp form.  (This is why these parameters use names
different from those of other, similar parameters supported by other
back ends: they have different, though similar, meanings.)  (For
numbers, strings, <code>nil</code>, and <code>t</code>, you can ignore the
<code>eval</code> business again; for other values, remember to use an extra
quote and wrap the value in a vector when appropriate.)

     <dl>
<dt><code>expire-age</code><dd>An integer specifying the minimum age, in seconds, of an article
before it will be expired, or the symbol <code>never</code> to specify that
articles should never be expired.  If this parameter is not set,
<code>nnmaildir</code> falls back to the usual
<code>nnmail-expiry-wait</code>(<code>-function</code>) variables (the
<code>expiry-wait</code> group parameter overrides <code>nnmail-expiry-wait</code>
and makes <code>nnmail-expiry-wait-function</code> ineffective).  If you
wanted a value of 3 days, you could use something like <code>[(* 3 24
60 60)]</code>; <code>nnmaildir</code> will evaluate the form and use the result. 
An article's age is measured starting from the article file's
modification time.  Normally, this is the same as the article's
delivery time, but editing an article makes it younger.  Moving an
article (other than via expiry) may also make an article younger.

     <br><dt><code>expire-group</code><dd>If this is set to a string such as a full Gnus group name, like
     <pre class="example">          "backend+server.address.string:group.name"
</pre>
     <p>and if it is not the name of the same group that the parameter belongs
to, then articles will be moved to the specified group during expiry
before being deleted.  <em>If this is set to an </em><code>nnmaildir</code><em>
group, the article will be just as old in the destination group as it
was in the source group.</em>  So be careful with <code>expire-age</code> in the
destination group.  If this is set to the name of the same group that
the parameter belongs to, then the article is not expired at all.  If
you use the vector form, the first element is evaluated once for each
article.  So that form can refer to
<code>nnmaildir-article-file-name</code>, etc., to decide where to put the
article.  <em>Even if this parameter is not set, </em><code>nnmaildir</code><em>
does not fall back to the </em><code>expiry-target</code><em> group parameter or the
</em><code>nnmail-expiry-target</code><em> variable.</em>

     <br><dt><code>read-only</code><dd>If this is set to <code>t</code>, <code>nnmaildir</code> will treat the articles
in this maildir as read-only.  This means: articles are not renamed
from <samp><span class="file">new/</span></samp> into <samp><span class="file">cur/</span></samp>; articles are only found in
<samp><span class="file">new/</span></samp>, not <samp><span class="file">cur/</span></samp>; articles are never deleted; articles
cannot be edited.  <samp><span class="file">new/</span></samp> is expected to be a symlink to the
<samp><span class="file">new/</span></samp> directory of another maildir&mdash;e.g., a system-wide mailbox
containing a mailing list of common interest.  Everything in the
maildir outside <samp><span class="file">new/</span></samp> is <em>not</em> treated as read-only, so for
a shared mailbox, you do still need to set up your own maildir (or
have write permission to the shared mailbox); your maildir just won't
contain extra copies of the articles.

     <br><dt><code>directory-files</code><dd>A function with the same interface as <code>directory-files</code>.  It is
used to scan the directories in the maildir corresponding to this
group to find articles.  The default is the function specified by the
server's <code>directory-files</code> parameter.

     <br><dt><code>distrust-Lines:</code><dd>If non-<code>nil</code>, <code>nnmaildir</code> will always count the lines of an
article, rather than use the <code>Lines:</code> header field.  If
<code>nil</code>, the header field will be used if present.

     <br><dt><code>always-marks</code><dd>A list of mark symbols, such as <code>['(read expire)]</code>.  Whenever
Gnus asks <code>nnmaildir</code> for article marks, <code>nnmaildir</code> will
say that all articles have these marks, regardless of whether the
marks stored in the filesystem say so.  This is a proof-of-concept
feature that will probably be removed eventually; it ought to be done
in Gnus proper, or abandoned if it's not worthwhile.

     <br><dt><code>never-marks</code><dd>A list of mark symbols, such as <code>['(tick expire)]</code>.  Whenever
Gnus asks <code>nnmaildir</code> for article marks, <code>nnmaildir</code> will
say that no articles have these marks, regardless of whether the marks
stored in the filesystem say so.  <code>never-marks</code> overrides
<code>always-marks</code>.  This is a proof-of-concept feature that will
probably be removed eventually; it ought to be done in Gnus proper, or
abandoned if it's not worthwhile.

     <br><dt><code>nov-cache-size</code><dd>An integer specifying the size of the <acronym>NOV</acronym> memory cache.  To
speed things up, <code>nnmaildir</code> keeps <acronym>NOV</acronym> data in memory
for a limited number of articles in each group.  (This is probably not
worthwhile, and will probably be removed in the future.)  This
parameter's value is noticed only the first time a group is seen after
the server is opened&mdash;i.e., when you first start Gnus, typically. 
The <acronym>NOV</acronym> cache is never resized until the server is closed
and reopened.  The default is an estimate of the number of articles
that would be displayed in the summary buffer: a count of articles
that are either marked with <code>tick</code> or not marked with
<code>read</code>, plus a little extra. 
</dl>

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.3.13.7 Article identification</h5>

<p>Articles are stored in the <samp><span class="file">cur/</span></samp> subdirectory of each maildir. 
Each article file is named like <code>uniq:info</code>, where <code>uniq</code>
contains no colons.  <code>nnmaildir</code> ignores, but preserves, the
<code>:info</code> part.  (Other maildir readers typically use this part of
the filename to store marks.)  The <code>uniq</code> part uniquely
identifies the article, and is used in various places in the
<samp><span class="file">.nnmaildir/</span></samp> subdirectory of the maildir to store information
about the corresponding article.  The full pathname of an article is
available in the variable <code>nnmaildir-article-file-name</code> after you
request the article in the summary buffer.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.3.13.8 NOV data</h5>

<p>An article identified by <code>uniq</code> has its <acronym>NOV</acronym> data (used
to generate lines in the summary buffer) stored in
<code>.nnmaildir/nov/uniq</code>.  There is no
<code>nnmaildir-generate-nov-databases</code> function.  (There isn't much
need for it&mdash;an article's <acronym>NOV</acronym> data is updated automatically
when the article or <code>nnmail-extra-headers</code> has changed.)  You can
force <code>nnmaildir</code> to regenerate the <acronym>NOV</acronym> data for a
single article simply by deleting the corresponding <acronym>NOV</acronym>
file, but <em>beware</em>: this will also cause <code>nnmaildir</code> to
assign a new article number for this article, which may cause trouble
with <code>seen</code> marks, the Agent, and the cache.

<h5 class="subsubsection">6.3.13.9 Article marks</h5>

<p>An article identified by <code>uniq</code> is considered to have the mark
<code>flag</code> when the file <samp><span class="file">.nnmaildir/marks/flag/uniq</span></samp> exists. 
When Gnus asks <code>nnmaildir</code> for a group's marks, <code>nnmaildir</code>
looks for such files and reports the set of marks it finds.  When Gnus
asks <code>nnmaildir</code> to store a new set of marks, <code>nnmaildir</code>
creates and deletes the corresponding files as needed.  (Actually,
rather than create a new file for each mark, it just creates hard
links to <samp><span class="file">.nnmaildir/markfile</span></samp>, to save inodes.)

   <p>You can invent new marks by creating a new directory in
<samp><span class="file">.nnmaildir/marks/</span></samp>.  You can tar up a maildir and remove it from
your server, untar it later, and keep your marks.  You can add and
remove marks yourself by creating and deleting mark files.  If you do
this while Gnus is running and your <code>nnmaildir</code> server is open,
it's best to exit all summary buffers for <code>nnmaildir</code> groups and
type <kbd>s</kbd> in the group buffer first, and to type <kbd>g</kbd> or
<kbd>M-g</kbd> in the group buffer afterwards.  Otherwise, Gnus might not
pick up the changes, and might undo them.
