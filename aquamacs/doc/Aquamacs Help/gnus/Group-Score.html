You would normally keep important groups on high levels, but that scheme
is somewhat restrictive.  Don't you wish you could have Gnus sort the
group buffer according to how often you read groups, perhaps?  Within
reason?

   <p>This is what <dfn>group score</dfn> is for.  You can have Gnus assign a score
to each group through the mechanism described below.  You can then sort
the group buffer based on this score.  Alternatively, you can sort on
score and then level.  (Taken together, the level and the score is
called the <dfn>rank</dfn> of the group.  A group that is on level 4 and has
a score of 1 has a higher rank than a group on level 5 that has a score
of 300.  (The level is the most significant part and the score is the
least significant part.))

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dbubble_002dgroup-185"></a>If you want groups you read often to get higher scores than groups you
read seldom you can add the <code>gnus-summary-bubble-group</code> function to
the <code>gnus-summary-exit-hook</code> hook.  This will result (after
sorting) in a bubbling sort of action.  If you want to see that in
action after each summary exit, you can add
<code>gnus-group-sort-groups-by-rank</code> or
<code>gnus-group-sort-groups-by-score</code> to the same hook, but that will
slow things down somewhat.
