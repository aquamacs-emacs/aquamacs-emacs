<h3 class="section">2.3 Selecting a Group</h3>

<p><a name="index-group-selection-119"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>SPACE</kbd><dd><a name="index-SPACE-_0028Group_0029-120"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dgroup_002dread_002dgroup-121"></a>Select the current group, switch to the summary buffer and display the
first unread article (<code>gnus-group-read-group</code>).  If there are no
unread articles in the group, or if you give a non-numerical prefix to
this command, Gnus will offer to fetch all the old articles in this
group from the server.  If you give a numerical prefix <var>n</var>, <var>n</var>
determines the number of articles Gnus will fetch.  If <var>n</var> is
positive, Gnus fetches the <var>n</var> newest articles, if <var>n</var> is
negative, Gnus fetches the <code>abs(</code><var>n</var><code>)</code> oldest articles.

     <p>Thus, <kbd>SPC</kbd> enters the group normally, <kbd>C-u SPC</kbd> offers old
articles, <kbd>C-u 4 2 SPC</kbd> fetches the 42 newest articles, and <kbd>C-u
- 4 2 SPC</kbd> fetches the 42 oldest ones.

     <p>When you are in the group (in the Summary buffer), you can type
<kbd>M-g</kbd> to fetch new articles, or <kbd>C-u M-g</kbd> to also show the old
ones.

     <br><dt><kbd>RET</kbd><dd><a name="index-RET-_0028Group_0029-122"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dgroup_002dselect_002dgroup-123"></a>Select the current group and switch to the summary buffer
(<code>gnus-group-select-group</code>).  Takes the same arguments as
<code>gnus-group-read-group</code>&mdash;the only difference is that this command
does not display the first unread article automatically upon group
entry.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-RET</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002dRET-_0028Group_0029-124"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dgroup_002dquick_002dselect_002dgroup-125"></a>This does the same as the command above, but tries to do it with the
minimum amount of fuzz (<code>gnus-group-quick-select-group</code>).  No
scoring/killing will be performed, there will be no highlights and no
expunging.  This might be useful if you're in a real hurry and have to
enter some humongous group.  If you give a 0 prefix to this command
(i.e., <kbd>0 M-RET</kbd>), Gnus won't even generate the summary buffer,
which is useful if you want to toggle threading before generating the
summary buffer (see <a href="Summary-Generation-Commands.html#Summary-Generation-Commands">Summary Generation Commands</a>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-SPACE</kbd><dd><a name="index-M_002dSPACE-_0028Group_0029-126"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dgroup_002dvisible_002dselect_002dgroup-127"></a>This is yet one more command that does the same as the <kbd>RET</kbd>
command, but this one does it without expunging and hiding dormants
(<code>gnus-group-visible-select-group</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-M-RET</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dM_002dRET-_0028Group_0029-128"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dgroup_002dselect_002dgroup_002dephemerally-129"></a>Finally, this command selects the current group ephemerally without
doing any processing of its contents
(<code>gnus-group-select-group-ephemerally</code>).  Even threading has been
turned off.  Everything you do in the group after selecting it in this
manner will have no permanent effects.

   </dl>

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dlarge_002dnewsgroup-130"></a>The <code>gnus-large-newsgroup</code> variable says what Gnus should
consider to be a big group.  If it is <code>nil</code>, no groups are
considered big.  The default value is 200.  If the group has more
(unread and/or ticked) articles than this, Gnus will query the user
before entering the group.  The user can then specify how many
articles should be fetched from the server.  If the user specifies a
negative number (<var>-n</var>), the <var>n</var> oldest articles will be
fetched.  If it is positive, the <var>n</var> articles that have arrived
most recently will be fetched.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dlarge_002dephemeral_002dnewsgroup-131"></a><code>gnus-large-ephemeral-newsgroup</code> is the same as
<code>gnus-large-newsgroup</code>, but is only used for ephemeral
newsgroups.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dnewsgroup_002dmaximum_002darticles-132"></a>In groups in some news servers, there might be a big gap between a few
very old articles that will never be expired and the recent ones.  In
such a case, the server will return the data like <code>(1 . 30000000)</code>
for the <code>LIST ACTIVE group</code> command, for example.  Even if there
are actually only the articles 1-10 and 29999900-30000000, Gnus doesn't
know it at first and prepares for getting 30000000 articles.  However,
it will consume hundreds megabytes of memories and might make Emacs get
stuck as the case may be.  If you use such news servers, set the
variable <code>gnus-newsgroup-maximum-articles</code> to a positive number. 
The value means that Gnus ignores articles other than this number of the
latest ones in every group.  For instance, the value 10000 makes Gnus
get only the articles 29990001-30000000 (if the latest article number is
30000000 in a group).  Note that setting this variable to a number might
prevent you from reading very old articles.  The default value of the
variable <code>gnus-newsgroup-maximum-articles</code> is <code>nil</code>, which
means Gnus never ignores old articles.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dselect_002dgroup_002dhook-133"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dauto_002dselect_002dfirst-134"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dauto_002dselect_002dsubject-135"></a>If <code>gnus-auto-select-first</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, select an article
automatically when entering a group with the <kbd>SPACE</kbd> command. 
Which article this is controlled by the
<code>gnus-auto-select-subject</code> variable.  Valid values for this
variable are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>unread</code><dd>Place point on the subject line of the first unread article.

     <br><dt><code>first</code><dd>Place point on the subject line of the first article.

     <br><dt><code>unseen</code><dd>Place point on the subject line of the first unseen article.

     <br><dt><code>unseen-or-unread</code><dd>Place point on the subject line of the first unseen article, and if
there is no such article, place point on the subject line of the first
unread article.

     <br><dt><code>best</code><dd>Place point on the subject line of the highest-scored unread article.

   </dl>

   <p>This variable can also be a function.  In that case, that function
will be called to place point on a subject line.

   <p>If you want to prevent automatic selection in some group (say, in a
binary group with Huge articles) you can set the
<code>gnus-auto-select-first</code> variable to <code>nil</code> in
<code>gnus-select-group-hook</code>, which is called when a group is
selected.
