  "index-Gnus-versions-2929"></a> The first &ldquo;proper&rdquo;
  release of Gnus 5 was done in November 1995 when it was included
  in the Emacs 19.30 distribution (132 (ding) Gnus releases plus 15
  Gnus 5.0 releases).</p>

  <p>In May 1996 the next Gnus generation (aka. &ldquo;September
  Gnus&rdquo; (after 99 releases)) was released under the name
  &ldquo;Gnus 5.2&rdquo; (40 releases).</p>

  <p>On July 28th 1996 work on Red Gnus was begun, and it was
  released on January 25th 1997 (after 84 releases) as &ldquo;Gnus
  5.4&rdquo; (67 releases).</p>

  <p>On September 13th 1997, Quassia Gnus was started and lasted 37
  releases. It was released as &ldquo;Gnus 5.6&rdquo; on March 8th
  1998 (46 releases).</p>

  <p>Gnus 5.6 begat Pterodactyl Gnus on August 29th 1998 and was
  released as &ldquo;Gnus 5.8&rdquo; (after 99 releases and a CVS
  repository) on December 3rd 1999.</p>

  <p>On the 26th of October 2000, Oort Gnus was begun and was
  released as Gnus 5.10 on May 1st 2003 (24 releases).</p>

  <p>On the January 4th 2004, No Gnus was begun.</p>

  <p>On April 19, 2010 Gnus development was moved to Git. See
  http://git.gnus.org for details (http://www.gnus.org will be
  updated with the information when possible).</p>

  <p>If you happen upon a version of Gnus that has a prefixed name
  &ndash; &ldquo;(ding) Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;September Gnus&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;Red Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;Quassia Gnus&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;Pterodactyl Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oort Gnus&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;No Gnus&rdquo; &ndash; don't panic. Don't let it know that
  you're frightened. Back away. Slowly. Whatever you do, don't run.
  Walk away, calmly, until you're out of its reach. Find a proper
  released version of Gnus and snuggle up to that instead.</p>
