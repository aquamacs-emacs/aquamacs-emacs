The first &ldquo;proper&rdquo; release of Gnus 5 was done in November 1995 when it
was included in the Emacs 19.30 distribution (132 (ding) Gnus releases
plus 15 Gnus 5.0 releases).

   <p>In May 1996 the next Gnus generation (aka. &ldquo;September Gnus&rdquo; (after 99
releases)) was released under the name &ldquo;Gnus 5.2&rdquo; (40 releases).

   <p>On July 28th 1996 work on Red Gnus was begun, and it was released on
January 25th 1997 (after 84 releases) as &ldquo;Gnus 5.4&rdquo; (67 releases).

   <p>On September 13th 1997, Quassia Gnus was started and lasted 37 releases. 
It was released as &ldquo;Gnus 5.6&rdquo; on March 8th 1998 (46 releases).

   <p>Gnus 5.6 begat Pterodactyl Gnus on August 29th 1998 and was released as
&ldquo;Gnus 5.8&rdquo; (after 99 releases and a CVS repository) on December 3rd
1999.

   <p>On the 26th of October 2000, Oort Gnus was begun and was released as
Gnus 5.10 on May 1st 2003 (24 releases).

   <p>On the January 4th 2004, No Gnus was begun.

   <p>On April 19, 2010 Gnus development was moved to Git.  See
http://git.gnus.org for details (http://www.gnus.org will be updated
with the information when possible).

   <p>If you happen upon a version of Gnus that has a prefixed name &ndash;
&ldquo;(ding) Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;September Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;Red Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;Quassia Gnus&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Pterodactyl Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oort Gnus&rdquo;, &ldquo;No Gnus&rdquo; &ndash; don't panic. 
Don't let it know that you're frightened.  Back away.  Slowly.  Whatever
you do, don't run.  Walk away, calmly, until you're out of its reach. 
Find a proper released version of Gnus and snuggle up to that instead.
