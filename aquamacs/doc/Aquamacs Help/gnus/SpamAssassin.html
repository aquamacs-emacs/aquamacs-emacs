<h4 class="subsection">8.19.3 SpamAssassin, Vipul's Razor, DCC, etc</h4>

The days where the hints in the previous section were sufficient in
avoiding spam are coming to an end.  There are many tools out there
that claim to reduce the amount of spam you get.  This section could
easily become outdated fast, as new products replace old, but
fortunately most of these tools seem to have similar interfaces.  Even
though this section will use SpamAssassin as an example, it should be
easy to adapt it to most other tools.

   <p>Note that this section does not involve the <code>spam.el</code> package,
which is discussed in the next section.  If you don't care for all
the features of <code>spam.el</code>, you can make do with these simple
recipes.

   <p>If the tool you are using is not installed on the mail server, you
need to invoke it yourself.  Ideas on how to use the
<code>:postscript</code> mail source parameter (see <a href="Mail-Source-Specifiers.html#Mail-Source-Specifiers">Mail Source Specifiers</a>) follow.

<pre class="lisp">     (setq mail-sources
           '((file :prescript "formail -bs spamassassin &lt; /var/mail/%u")
             (pop :user "jrl"
                  :server "pophost"
                  :postscript
                  "mv %t /tmp/foo; formail -bs spamc &lt; /tmp/foo &gt; %t")))
</pre>
   <p>Once you manage to process your incoming spool somehow, thus making
the mail contain e.g. a header indicating it is spam, you are ready to
filter it out.  Using normal split methods (see <a href="Splitting-Mail.html#Splitting-Mail">Splitting Mail</a>):

<pre class="lisp">     (setq nnmail-split-methods '(("spam"  "^X-Spam-Flag: YES")
                                  ...))
</pre>
   <p>Or using fancy split methods (see <a href="Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy Mail Splitting</a>):

<pre class="lisp">     (setq nnmail-split-methods 'nnmail-split-fancy
           nnmail-split-fancy '(| ("X-Spam-Flag" "YES" "spam")
                                  ...))
</pre>
   <p>Some people might not like the idea of piping the mail through various
programs using a <code>:prescript</code> (if some program is buggy, you
might lose all mail).  If you are one of them, another solution is to
call the external tools during splitting.  Example fancy split method:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq nnmail-split-fancy '(| (: kevin-spamassassin)
                                  ...))
     (defun kevin-spamassassin ()
       (save-excursion
         (save-restriction
           (widen)
           (if (eq 1 (call-process-region (point-min) (point-max)
                                          "spamc" nil nil nil "-c"))
               "spam"))))
</pre>
   <p>Note that with the nnimap back end, message bodies will not be
downloaded by default.  You need to set
<code>nnimap-split-download-body</code> to <code>t</code> to do that
(see <a href="Splitting-in-IMAP.html#Splitting-in-IMAP">Splitting in IMAP</a>).

   <p>That is about it.  As some spam is likely to get through anyway, you
might want to have a nifty function to call when you happen to read
spam.  And here is the nifty function:

<pre class="lisp">     (defun my-gnus-raze-spam ()
       "Submit SPAM to Vipul's Razor, then mark it as expirable."
       (interactive)
       (gnus-summary-save-in-pipe "razor-report -f -d" t)
       (gnus-summary-mark-as-expirable 1))
</pre>
