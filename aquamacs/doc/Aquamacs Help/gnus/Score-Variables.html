<h3 class="section">7.3 Score Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-score-variables-2628"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>gnus-use-scoring</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002duse_002dscoring-2629"></a>If <code>nil</code>, Gnus will not check for score files, and will not, in
general, do any score-related work.  This is <code>t</code> by default.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-kill-killed</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dkill_002dkilled-2630"></a>If this variable is <code>nil</code>, Gnus will never apply score files to
articles that have already been through the kill process.  While this
may save you lots of time, it also means that if you apply a kill file
to a group, and then change the kill file and want to run it over you
group again to kill more articles, it won't work.  You have to set this
variable to <code>t</code> to do that.  (It is <code>t</code> by default.)

     <br><dt><code>gnus-kill-files-directory</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dkill_002dfiles_002ddirectory-2631"></a>All kill and score files will be stored in this directory, which is
initialized from the <samp><span class="env">SAVEDIR</span></samp> environment variable by default. 
This is <samp><span class="file">~/News/</span></samp> by default.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-score-file-suffix</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dfile_002dsuffix-2632"></a>Suffix to add to the group name to arrive at the score file name
(<samp><span class="file">SCORE</span></samp> by default.)

     <br><dt><code>gnus-score-uncacheable-files</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002duncacheable_002dfiles-2633"></a><a name="index-score-cache-2634"></a>All score files are normally cached to avoid excessive re-loading of
score files.  However, this might make your Emacs grow big and
bloated, so this regexp can be used to weed out score files unlikely
to be needed again.  It would be a bad idea to deny caching of
<samp><span class="file">all.SCORE</span></samp>, while it might be a good idea to not cache
<samp><span class="file">comp.infosystems.www.authoring.misc.ADAPT</span></samp>.  In fact, this
variable is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ADAPT$</span></samp>&rsquo; by default, so no adaptive score files will
be cached.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-save-score</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dsave_002dscore-2635"></a>If you have really complicated score files, and do lots of batch
scoring, then you might set this variable to <code>t</code>.  This will make
Gnus save the scores into the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp> file.

     <p>If you do not set this to <code>t</code>, then manual scores (like those set
with <kbd>V s</kbd> (<code>gnus-summary-set-score</code>)) will not be preserved
across group visits.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-score-interactive-default-score</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dinteractive_002ddefault_002dscore-2636"></a>Score used by all the interactive raise/lower commands to raise/lower
score with.  Default is 1000, which may seem excessive, but this is to
ensure that the adaptive scoring scheme gets enough room to play with. 
We don't want the small changes from the adaptive scoring to overwrite
manually entered data.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-summary-default-score</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002ddefault_002dscore-2637"></a>Default score of an article, which is 0 by default.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-summary-expunge-below</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dexpunge_002dbelow-2638"></a>Don't display the summary lines of articles that have scores lower than
this variable.  This is <code>nil</code> by default, which means that no
articles will be hidden.  This variable is local to the summary buffers,
and has to be set from <code>gnus-summary-mode-hook</code>.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-score-over-mark</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dover_002dmark-2639"></a>Mark (in the third column) used for articles with a score over the
default.  Default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-score-below-mark</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dbelow_002dmark-2640"></a>Mark (in the third column) used for articles with a score below the
default.  Default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-score-find-score-files-function</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dfind_002dscore_002dfiles_002dfunction-2641"></a>Function used to find score files for the current group.  This function
is called with the name of the group as the argument.

     <p>Predefined functions available are:
          <dl>
<dt><code>gnus-score-find-single</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dfind_002dsingle-2642"></a>Only apply the group's own score file.

          <br><dt><code>gnus-score-find-bnews</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dfind_002dbnews-2643"></a>Apply all score files that match, using bnews syntax.  This is the
default.  If the current group is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu.emacs.gnus</span></samp>&rsquo;, for instance,
<samp><span class="file">all.emacs.all.SCORE</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">not.alt.all.SCORE</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">gnu.all.SCORE</span></samp> would all apply.  In short, the instances of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo; in the score file names are translated into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.*</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
then a regexp match is done.

          <p>This means that if you have some score entries that you want to apply to
all groups, then you put those entries in the <samp><span class="file">all.SCORE</span></samp> file.

          <p>The score files are applied in a semi-random order, although Gnus will
try to apply the more general score files before the more specific score
files.  It does this by looking at the number of elements in the score
file names&mdash;discarding the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo; elements.

          <br><dt><code>gnus-score-find-hierarchical</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dfind_002dhierarchical-2644"></a>Apply all score files from all the parent groups.  This means that you
can't have score files like <samp><span class="file">all.SCORE</span></samp>, but you can have
<samp><span class="file">SCORE</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">comp.SCORE</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">comp.emacs.SCORE</span></samp> for each
server.

     </dl>
     This variable can also be a list of functions.  In that case, all
these functions will be called with the group name as argument, and
all the returned lists of score files will be applied.  These
functions can also return lists of lists of score alists directly.  In
that case, the functions that return these non-file score alists
should probably be placed before the &ldquo;real&rdquo; score file functions, to
ensure that the last score file returned is the local score file. 
Phu.

     <p>For example, to do hierarchical scoring but use a non-server-specific
overall score file, you could use the value
     <pre class="example">          (list (lambda (group) ("all.SCORE"))
                'gnus-score-find-hierarchical)
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>gnus-score-expiry-days</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dexpiry_002ddays-2645"></a>This variable says how many days should pass before an unused score file
entry is expired.  If this variable is <code>nil</code>, no score file entries
are expired.  It's 7 by default.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-update-score-entry-dates</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dupdate_002dscore_002dentry_002ddates-2646"></a>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, temporary score entries that have
been triggered (matched) will have their dates updated.  (This is how Gnus
controls expiry&mdash;all non-matched-entries will become too old while
matched entries will stay fresh and young.)  However, if you set this
variable to <code>nil</code>, even matched entries will grow old and will
have to face that oh-so grim reaper.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-score-after-write-file-function</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dafter_002dwrite_002dfile_002dfunction-2647"></a>Function called with the name of the score file just written.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-score-thread-simplify</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dscore_002dthread_002dsimplify-2648"></a>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, article subjects will be
simplified for subject scoring purposes in the same manner as with
threading&mdash;according to the current value of
<code>gnus-simplify-subject-functions</code>.  If the scoring entry uses
<code>substring</code> or <code>exact</code> matching, the match will also be
simplified in this manner.
