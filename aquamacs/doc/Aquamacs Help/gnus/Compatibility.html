  <h4 class="subsection">11.2.4 Compatibility</h4>

  <p><a name="index-compatibility-2931" id=
  "index-compatibility-2931"></a>Gnus was designed to be fully
  compatible with <span class="sc">gnus</span>. Almost all key
  bindings have been kept. More key bindings have been added, of
  course, but only in one or two obscure cases have old bindings
  been changed.</p>

  <p>Our motto is:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <div class="c1">
            In a cloud bones of steel.
          </div>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </blockquote>

  <p>All commands have kept their names. Some internal functions
  have changed their names.</p>

  <p>The <code>gnus-uu</code> package has changed drastically. See
  <a href="Decoding-Articles.html#Decoding-Articles">Decoding
  Articles</a>.</p>

  <p>One major compatibility question is the presence of several
  summary buffers. All variables relevant while reading a group are
  buffer-local to the summary buffer they belong in. Although many
  important variables have their values copied into their global
  counterparts whenever a command is executed in the summary
  buffer, this change might lead to incorrect values being used
  unless you are careful.</p>

  <p>All code that relies on knowledge of <span class=
  "sc">gnus</span> internals will probably fail. To take two
  examples: Sorting <code>gnus-newsrc-alist</code> (or changing it
  in any way, as a matter of fact) is strictly verboten. Gnus
  maintains a hash table that points to the entries in this alist
  (which speeds up many functions), and changing the alist directly
  will lead to peculiar results.</p>

  <p><a name="index-hilit19-2932" id=
  "index-hilit19-2932"></a><a name="index-highlighting-2933" id=
  "index-highlighting-2933"></a>Old hilit19 code does not work at
  all. In fact, you should probably remove all hilit code from all
  Gnus hooks (<code>gnus-group-prepare-hook</code> and
  <code>gnus-summary-prepare-hook</code>). Gnus provides various
  integrated functions for highlighting. These are faster and more
  accurate. To make life easier for everybody, Gnus will by default
  remove all hilit calls from all hilit hooks. Uncleanliness!
  Away!</p>

  <p>Packages like <code>expire-kill</code> will no longer work. As
  a matter of fact, you should probably remove all old <span class=
  "sc">gnus</span> packages (and other code) when you start using
  Gnus. More likely than not, Gnus already does what you have
  written code to make <span class="sc">gnus</span> do.
  (Snicker.)</p>

  <p>Even though old methods of doing things are still supported,
  only the new methods are documented in this manual. If you detect
  a new method of doing something while reading this manual, that
  does not mean you have to stop doing it the old way.</p>

  <p>Gnus understands all <span class="sc">gnus</span> startup
  files.</p>

  id="index-reporting-bugs-2936"></a><a name="index-bugs-2937" id=
  "index-bugs-2937"></a>Overall, a casual user who hasn't written
  much code that depends on <span class="sc">gnus</span> internals
  should suffer no problems. If problems occur, please let me know
  by issuing that magic command <kbd>M-x gnus-bug</kbd>.</p>

  "index-gnus_002dbug_002dcreate_002dhelp_002dbuffer-2938"></a>If
  you are in the habit of sending bug reports <em>very</em> often,
  you may find the helpful help buffer annoying after a while. If
  so, set <code>gnus-bug-create-help-buffer</code> to
  <code>nil</code> to avoid having it pop up at you.</p>
