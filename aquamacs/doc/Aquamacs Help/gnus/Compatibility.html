<h4 class="subsection">10.2.4 Compatibility</h4>

<p><a name="index-compatibility-3071"></a>Gnus was designed to be fully compatible with <span class="sc">gnus</span>.  Almost all key
bindings have been kept.  More key bindings have been added, of course,
but only in one or two obscure cases have old bindings been changed.

   <p>Our motto is:
<blockquote>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<div align="center">In a cloud bones of steel.</div>
   </td></tr></table>
</blockquote>

   <p>All commands have kept their names.  Some internal functions have changed
their names.

   <p>The <code>gnus-uu</code> package has changed drastically.  See <a href="Decoding-Articles.html#Decoding-Articles">Decoding Articles</a>.

   <p>One major compatibility question is the presence of several summary
buffers.  All variables relevant while reading a group are
buffer-local to the summary buffer they belong in.  Although many
important variables have their values copied into their global
counterparts whenever a command is executed in the summary buffer, this
change might lead to incorrect values being used unless you are careful.

   <p>All code that relies on knowledge of <span class="sc">gnus</span> internals will probably
fail.  To take two examples: Sorting <code>gnus-newsrc-alist</code> (or
changing it in any way, as a matter of fact) is strictly verboten.  Gnus
maintains a hash table that points to the entries in this alist (which
speeds up many functions), and changing the alist directly will lead to
peculiar results.

   <p><a name="index-hilit19-3072"></a><a name="index-highlighting-3073"></a>Old hilit19 code does not work at all.  In fact, you should probably
remove all hilit code from all Gnus hooks
(<code>gnus-group-prepare-hook</code> and <code>gnus-summary-prepare-hook</code>). 
Gnus provides various integrated functions for highlighting.  These are
faster and more accurate.  To make life easier for everybody, Gnus will
by default remove all hilit calls from all hilit hooks.  Uncleanliness! 
Away!

   <p>Packages like <code>expire-kill</code> will no longer work.  As a matter of
fact, you should probably remove all old <span class="sc">gnus</span> packages (and other
code) when you start using Gnus.  More likely than not, Gnus already
does what you have written code to make <span class="sc">gnus</span> do.  (Snicker.)

   <p>Even though old methods of doing things are still supported, only the
new methods are documented in this manual.  If you detect a new method of
doing something while reading this manual, that does not mean you have
to stop doing it the old way.

   <p>Gnus understands all <span class="sc">gnus</span> startup files.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dx-gnus_002dbug-3074"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dbug-3075"></a><a name="index-reporting-bugs-3076"></a><a name="index-bugs-3077"></a>Overall, a casual user who hasn't written much code that depends on
<span class="sc">gnus</span> internals should suffer no problems.  If problems occur,
please let me know by issuing that magic command <kbd>M-x gnus-bug</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dbug_002dcreate_002dhelp_002dbuffer-3078"></a>If you are in the habit of sending bug reports <em>very</em> often, you
may find the helpful help buffer annoying after a while.  If so, set
<code>gnus-bug-create-help-buffer</code> to <code>nil</code> to avoid having it pop
up at you.
