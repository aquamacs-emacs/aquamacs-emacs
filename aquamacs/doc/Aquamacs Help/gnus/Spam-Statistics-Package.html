  has written an excellent essay about spam filtering using
  statistics: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">A Plan
  for Spam</a>. In it he describes the inherent deficiency of
  rule-based filtering as used by SpamAssassin, for example:
  Somebody has to write the rules, and everybody else has to
  install these rules. You are always late. It would be much
  better, he argues, to filter mail based on whether it somehow
  resembles spam or non-spam. One way to measure this is word
  distribution. He then goes on to describe a solution that checks
  whether a new mail resembles any of your other spam mails or
  not.</p>

  <p>The basic idea is this: Create a two collections of your mail,
  one with spam, one with non-spam. Count how often each word
  appears in either collection, weight this by the total number of
  mails in the collections, and store this information in a
  dictionary. For every word in a new mail, determine its
  probability to belong to a spam or a non-spam mail. Use the 15
  most conspicuous words, compute the total probability of the mail
  being spam. If this probability is higher than a certain
  threshold, the mail is considered to be spam.</p>

  <p>The Spam Statistics package adds support to Gnus for this kind
  of filtering. It can be used as one of the back ends of the Spam
  package (see <a href="Spam-Package.html#Spam-Package">Spam
  Package</a>), or by itself.</p>

  <p>Before using the Spam Statistics package, you need to set it
  up. First, you need two collections of your mail, one with spam,
  one with non-spam. Then you need to create a dictionary using
  these two collections, and save it. And last but not least, you
  need to use this dictionary in your fancy mail splitting
  rules.</p>
