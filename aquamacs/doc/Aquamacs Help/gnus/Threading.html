<h3 class="section">3.9 Threading</h3>

<p><a name="index-threading-1015"></a><a name="index-article-threading-1016"></a>
Gnus threads articles by default.  <dfn>To thread</dfn> is to put responses
to articles directly after the articles they respond to&mdash;in a
hierarchical fashion.

   <p>Threading is done by looking at the <code>References</code> headers of the
articles.  In a perfect world, this would be enough to build pretty
trees, but unfortunately, the <code>References</code> header is often broken
or simply missing.  Weird news propagation exacerbates the problem,
so one has to employ other heuristics to get pleasing results.  A
plethora of approaches exists, as detailed in horrible detail in
<a href="Customizing-Threading.html#Customizing-Threading">Customizing Threading</a>.

   <p>First, a quick overview of the concepts:

     <dl>
<dt><dfn>root</dfn><dd>The top-most article in a thread; the first article in the thread.

     <br><dt><dfn>thread</dfn><dd>A tree-like article structure.

     <br><dt><dfn>sub-thread</dfn><dd>A small(er) section of this tree-like structure.

     <br><dt><dfn>loose threads</dfn><dd>Threads often lose their roots due to article expiry, or due to the root
already having been read in a previous session, and not displayed in the
summary buffer.  We then typically have many sub-threads that really
belong to one thread, but are without connecting roots.  These are
called loose threads.

     <br><dt><dfn>thread gathering</dfn><dd>An attempt to gather loose threads into bigger threads.

     <br><dt><dfn>sparse threads</dfn><dd>A thread where the missing articles have been &ldquo;guessed&rdquo; at, and are
displayed as empty lines in the summary buffer.

   </dl>
