<h5 class="subsubsection">2.18.2.9 nnmairix caveats</h5>

     <ul>
<li>You can create a secondary <code>nnml</code> server just for nnmairix, but then
you have to explicitly set the corresponding server variable
<code>nnml-get-new-mail</code> to <code>nil</code>.  Otherwise, new mail might get
put into this secondary server (and would never show up again).  Here's
an example server definition:

     <pre class="lisp">          (nnml "mairix" (nnml-directory "mairix") (nnml-get-new-mail nil))
</pre>
     <p>(The <code>nnmaildir</code> back end also has a server variabe
<code>get-new-mail</code>, but its default value is <code>nil</code>, so you don't
have to explicitly set it if you use a <code>nnmaildir</code> server just for
mairix.)

     <li>If you use the Gnus registry: don't use the registry with
<code>nnmairix</code> groups (put them in
<code>gnus-registry-unfollowed-groups</code>).  Be <em>extra careful</em> if
you use <code>gnus-registry-split-fancy-with-parent</code>; mails which are
split into <code>nnmairix</code> groups are usually gone for good as soon as
you check the group for new mail (yes, it has happened to me...).

     <li>Therefore: <em>Never ever</em> put &ldquo;real&rdquo; mails into <code>nnmairix</code>
groups (you shouldn't be able to, anyway).

     <li>If you use the Gnus agent (see <a href="Gnus-Unplugged.html#Gnus-Unplugged">Gnus Unplugged</a>): don't agentize
<code>nnmairix</code> groups (though I have no idea what happens if you do).

     <li>mairix does only support us-ascii characters.

     <li><code>nnmairix</code> uses a rather brute force method to force Gnus to
completely reread the group on the mail back end after mairix was
called&mdash;it simply deletes and re-creates the group on the mail
back end. So far, this has worked for me without any problems, and I
don't see how <code>nnmairix</code> could delete other mail groups than its
own, but anyway: you really should have a backup of your mail
folders.

     <li>All necessary information is stored in the group parameters
(see <a href="Group-Parameters.html#Group-Parameters">Group Parameters</a>). This has the advantage that no active file
is needed, but also implies that when you kill a <code>nnmairix</code> group,
it is gone for good.

     <li><a name="index-nnmairix_002dpurge_002dold_002dgroups-559"></a>If you create and kill a lot of <code>nnmairix</code> groups, the
&ldquo;zz_mairix-*&rdquo; groups will accumulate on the mail back end server. To
delete old groups which are no longer needed, call
<code>nnmairix-purge-old-groups</code>. Note that this assumes that you don't
save any &ldquo;real&rdquo; mail in folders of the form
<code>zz_mairix-&lt;NAME&gt;-&lt;NUMBER&gt;</code>. You can change the prefix of
<code>nnmairix</code> groups by changing the variable
<code>nnmairix-group-prefix</code>.

     <li>The following only applies if you <em>don't</em> use the mentioned patch
for mairix (see <a href="Propagating-marks.html#Propagating-marks">Propagating marks</a>):

     <p>A problem can occur when using <code>nnmairix</code> with maildir folders and
comes with the fact that maildir stores mail flags like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Seen</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Replied</span></samp>&rsquo; by appending chars &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo; to the message
file name, respectively. This implies that currently you would have to
update the mairix database not only when new mail arrives, but also when
mail flags are changing. The same applies to new mails which are indexed
while they are still in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">new</span></samp>&rsquo; folder but then get moved to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cur</span></samp>&rsquo; when Gnus has seen the mail. If you don't update the database
after this has happened, a mairix query can lead to symlinks pointing to
non-existing files. In Gnus, these messages will usually appear with
&ldquo;(none)&rdquo; entries in the header and can't be accessed. If this happens
to you, using <kbd>G b u</kbd> and updating the group will usually fix this.

</ul>
