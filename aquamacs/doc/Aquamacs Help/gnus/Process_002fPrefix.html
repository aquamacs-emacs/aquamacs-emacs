<h3 class="section">8.1 Process/Prefix</h3>

<p><a name="index-process_002fprefix-convention-2714"></a>
Many functions, among them functions for moving, decoding and saving
articles, use what is known as the <dfn>Process/Prefix convention</dfn>.

   <p>This is a method for figuring out what articles the user wants the
command to be performed on.

   <p>It goes like this:

   <p>If the numeric prefix is N, perform the operation on the next N
articles, starting with the current one.  If the numeric prefix is
negative, perform the operation on the previous N articles, starting
with the current one.

   <p><a name="index-transient_002dmark_002dmode-2715"></a>If <code>transient-mark-mode</code> in non-<code>nil</code> and the region is
active, all articles in the region will be worked upon.

   <p>If there is no numeric prefix, but some articles are marked with the
process mark, perform the operation on the articles marked with
the process mark.

   <p>If there is neither a numeric prefix nor any articles marked with the
process mark, just perform the operation on the current article.

   <p>Quite simple, really, but it needs to be made clear so that surprises
are avoided.

   <p>Commands that react to the process mark will push the current list of
process marked articles onto a stack and will then clear all process
marked articles.  You can restore the previous configuration with the
<kbd>M P y</kbd> command (see <a href="Setting-Process-Marks.html#Setting-Process-Marks">Setting Process Marks</a>).

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dsummary_002dgoto_002dunread-2716"></a>One thing that seems to shock &amp; horrify lots of people is that, for
instance, <kbd>3 d</kbd> does exactly the same as <kbd>d</kbd> <kbd>d</kbd> <kbd>d</kbd>. 
Since each <kbd>d</kbd> (which marks the current article as read) by default
goes to the next unread article after marking, this means that <kbd>3 d</kbd>
will mark the next three unread articles as read, no matter what the
summary buffer looks like.  Set <code>gnus-summary-goto-unread</code> to
<code>nil</code> for a more straightforward action.

   <p>Many commands do not use the process/prefix convention.  All commands
that do explicitly say so in this manual.  To apply the process/prefix
convention to commands that do not use it, you can use the <kbd>M-&amp;</kbd>
command.  For instance, to mark all the articles in the group as
expirable, you could say <kbd>M P b M-&amp; E</kbd>.
