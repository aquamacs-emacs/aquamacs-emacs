<h3 class="section">1.4 Slave Gnusae</h3>

<p><a name="index-slave-22"></a>
You might want to run more than one Emacs with more than one Gnus at the
same time.  If you are using different <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> files (e.g., if you
are using the two different Gnusae to read from two different servers),
that is no problem whatsoever.  You just do it.

   <p>The problem appears when you want to run two Gnusae that use the same
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file.

   <p>To work around that problem some, we here at the Think-Tank at the Gnus
Towers have come up with a new concept: <dfn>Masters</dfn> and
<dfn>slaves</dfn>.  (We have applied for a patent on this concept, and have
taken out a copyright on those words.  If you wish to use those words in
conjunction with each other, you have to send $1 per usage instance to
me.  Usage of the patent (<dfn>Master/Slave Relationships In Computer
Applications</dfn>) will be much more expensive, of course.)

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dslave-23"></a>Anyway, you start one Gnus up the normal way with <kbd>M-x gnus</kbd> (or
however you do it).  Each subsequent slave Gnusae should be started with
<kbd>M-x gnus-slave</kbd>.  These slaves won't save normal <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp>
files, but instead save <dfn>slave files</dfn> that contain information only
on what groups have been read in the slave session.  When a master Gnus
starts, it will read (and delete) these slave files, incorporating all
information from them.  (The slave files will be read in the sequence
they were created, so the latest changes will have precedence.)

   <p>Information from the slave files has, of course, precedence over the
information in the normal (i.e., master) <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file.

   <p>If the <samp><span class="file">.newsrc*</span></samp> files have not been saved in the master when the
slave starts, you may be prompted as to whether to read an auto-save
file.  If you answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, the unsaved changes to the master will be
incorporated into the slave.  If you answer &ldquo;no&rdquo;, the slave may see some
messages as unread that have been read in the master.
