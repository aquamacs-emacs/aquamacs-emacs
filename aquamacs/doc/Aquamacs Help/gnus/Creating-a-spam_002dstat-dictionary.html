<h5 class="subsubsection">8.20.8.1 Creating a spam-stat dictionary</h5>

<p>Before you can begin to filter spam based on statistics, you must
create these statistics based on two mail collections, one with spam,
one with non-spam.  These statistics are then stored in a dictionary
for later use.  In order for these statistics to be meaningful, you
need several hundred emails in both collections.

   <p>Gnus currently supports only the nnml back end for automated dictionary
creation.  The nnml back end stores all mails in a directory, one file
per mail.  Use the following:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>spam-stat-process-spam-directory</b><var><a name="index-spam_002dstat_002dprocess_002dspam_002ddirectory-3002"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Create spam statistics for every file in this directory.  Every file
is treated as one spam mail. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>spam-stat-process-non-spam-directory</b><var><a name="index-spam_002dstat_002dprocess_002dnon_002dspam_002ddirectory-3003"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Create non-spam statistics for every file in this directory.  Every
file is treated as one non-spam mail. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Usually you would call <code>spam-stat-process-spam-directory</code> on a
directory such as <samp><span class="file">~/Mail/mail/spam</span></samp> (this usually corresponds to
the group &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nnml:mail.spam</span></samp>&rsquo;), and you would call
<code>spam-stat-process-non-spam-directory</code> on a directory such as
<samp><span class="file">~/Mail/mail/misc</span></samp> (this usually corresponds to the group
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nnml:mail.misc</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p>When you are using <acronym>IMAP</acronym>, you won't have the mails available
locally, so that will not work.  One solution is to use the Gnus Agent
to cache the articles.  Then you can use directories such as
<samp><span class="file">"~/News/agent/nnimap/mail.yourisp.com/personal_spam"</span></samp> for
<code>spam-stat-process-spam-directory</code>.  See <a href="Agent-as-Cache.html#Agent-as-Cache">Agent as Cache</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>spam-stat</b><var><a name="index-spam_002dstat-3004"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds the hash-table with all the statistics&mdash;the
dictionary we have been talking about.  For every word in either
collection, this hash-table stores a vector describing how often the
word appeared in spam and often it appeared in non-spam mails. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If you want to regenerate the statistics from scratch, you need to
reset the dictionary.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>spam-stat-reset</b><var><a name="index-spam_002dstat_002dreset-3005"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Reset the <code>spam-stat</code> hash-table, deleting all the statistics. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>When you are done, you must save the dictionary.  The dictionary may
be rather large.  If you will not update the dictionary incrementally
(instead, you will recreate it once a month, for example), then you
can reduce the size of the dictionary by deleting all words that did
not appear often enough or that do not clearly belong to only spam or
only non-spam mails.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>spam-stat-reduce-size</b><var><a name="index-spam_002dstat_002dreduce_002dsize-3006"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Reduce the size of the dictionary.  Use this only if you do not want
to update the dictionary incrementally. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>spam-stat-save</b><var><a name="index-spam_002dstat_002dsave-3007"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Save the dictionary. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>spam-stat-file</b><var><a name="index-spam_002dstat_002dfile-3008"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The filename used to store the dictionary.  This defaults to
<samp><span class="file">~/.spam-stat.el</span></samp>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   </body></html>
