<h3 class="section">10.6 Troubleshooting</h3>

<p><a name="index-troubleshooting-3144"></a>
Gnus works <em>so</em> well straight out of the box&mdash;I can't imagine any
problems, really.

   <p>Ahem.

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Make sure your computer is switched on.

     <li>Make sure that you really load the current Gnus version.  If you have
been running <span class="sc">gnus</span>, you need to exit Emacs and start it up again before
Gnus will work.

     <li>Try doing an <kbd>M-x gnus-version</kbd>.  If you get something that looks
like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Gnus v5.13</span></samp>&rsquo; <!-- Adjust ../Makefile.in if you change this line! -->
you have the right files loaded.  Otherwise you have some old <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp>
files lying around.  Delete these.

     <li>Read the help group (<kbd>G h</kbd> in the group buffer) for a
<acronym>FAQ</acronym> and a how-to.

     <li><a name="index-max_002dlisp_002deval_002ddepth-3145"></a>Gnus works on many recursive structures, and in some extreme (and very
rare) cases Gnus may recurse down &ldquo;too deeply&rdquo; and Emacs will beep at
you.  If this happens to you, set <code>max-lisp-eval-depth</code> to 500 or
something like that.
        </ol>

   <p>If all else fails, report the problem as a bug.

   <p><a name="index-bugs-3146"></a><a name="index-reporting-bugs-3147"></a>
<a name="index-M_002dx-gnus_002dbug-3148"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dbug-3149"></a>If you find a bug in Gnus, you can report it with the <kbd>M-x gnus-bug</kbd>
command.  <kbd>M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET</kbd>, and send
me the backtrace.  I will fix bugs, but I can only fix them if you send
me a precise description as to how to reproduce the bug.

   <p>You really can never be too detailed in a bug report.  Always use the
<kbd>M-x gnus-bug</kbd> command when you make bug reports, even if it creates
a 10Kb mail each time you use it, and even if you have sent me your
environment 500 times before.  I don't care.  I want the full info each
time.

   <p>It is also important to remember that I have no memory whatsoever.  If
you send a bug report, and I send you a reply, and then you just send
back &ldquo;No, it's not! Moron!&rdquo;, I will have no idea what you are
insulting me about.  Always over-explain everything.  It's much easier
for all of us&mdash;if I don't have all the information I need, I will just
mail you and ask for more info, and everything takes more time.

   <p>If the problem you're seeing is very visual, and you can't quite explain
it, copy the Emacs window to a file (with <code>xwd</code>, for instance), put
it somewhere it can be reached, and include the URL of the picture in
the bug report.

   <p><a name="index-patches-3150"></a>If you would like to contribute a patch to fix bugs or make
improvements, please produce the patch using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">diff -u</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-edebug-3151"></a>If you want to debug your problem further before reporting, possibly
in order to solve the problem yourself and send a patch, you can use
edebug.  Debugging Lisp code is documented in the Elisp manual
(see <a href="../elisp/Debugging.html#Debugging">Debugging Lisp Programs</a>).  To get you started with edebug, consider if
you discover some weird behavior when pressing <kbd>c</kbd>, the first
step is to do <kbd>C-h k c</kbd> and click on the hyperlink (Emacs only) in
the documentation buffer that leads you to the function definition,
then press <kbd>M-x edebug-defun RET</kbd> with point inside that function,
return to Gnus and press <kbd>c</kbd> to invoke the code.  You will be
placed in the lisp buffer and can single step using <kbd>SPC</kbd> and
evaluate expressions using <kbd>M-:</kbd> or inspect variables using
<kbd>C-h v</kbd>, abort execution with <kbd>q</kbd>, and resume execution with
<kbd>c</kbd> or <kbd>g</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-elp-3152"></a><a name="index-profile-3153"></a><a name="index-slow-3154"></a>Sometimes, a problem do not directly generate an elisp error but
manifests itself by causing Gnus to be very slow.  In these cases, you
can use <kbd>M-x toggle-debug-on-quit</kbd> and press <kbd>C-g</kbd> when things are
slow, and then try to analyze the backtrace (repeating the procedure
helps isolating the real problem areas).

   <p>A fancier approach is to use the elisp profiler, ELP.  The profiler is
(or should be) fully documented elsewhere, but to get you started
there are a few steps that need to be followed.  First, instrument the
part of Gnus you are interested in for profiling, e.g. <kbd>M-x
elp-instrument-package RET gnus</kbd> or <kbd>M-x elp-instrument-package
RET message</kbd>.  Then perform the operation that is slow and press
<kbd>M-x elp-results</kbd>.  You will then see which operations that takes
time, and can debug them further.  If the entire operation takes much
longer than the time spent in the slowest function in the profiler
output, you probably profiled the wrong part of Gnus.  To reset
profiling statistics, use <kbd>M-x elp-reset-all</kbd>.  <kbd>M-x
elp-restore-all</kbd> is supposed to remove profiling, but given the
complexities and dynamic code generation in Gnus, it might not always
work perfectly.

&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu.emacs.gnus</span></samp>&rsquo;.  I'm not very helpful.  You can also ask on
<a href="mailto:ding@gnus.org">the ding mailing list</a>.  Write to
