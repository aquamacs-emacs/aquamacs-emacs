<h4 class="subsection">8.19.2 Anti-Spam Basics</h4>

<p><a name="index-email-spam-2859"></a><a name="index-spam-2860"></a><a name="index-UCE-2861"></a><a name="index-unsolicited-commercial-email-2862"></a>
One way of dealing with spam is having Gnus split out all spam into a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo; mail group (see <a href="Splitting-Mail.html#Splitting-Mail">Splitting Mail</a>).

   <p>First, pick one (1) valid mail address that you can be reached at, and
put it in your <code>From</code> header of all your news articles.  (I've
chosen &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no</span></samp>&rsquo;, but for many addresses on the form
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">larsi+usenet@ifi.uio.no</span></samp>&rsquo; will be a better choice.  Ask your
sysadmin whether your sendmail installation accepts keywords in the local
part of the mail address.)

<pre class="lisp">     (setq message-default-news-headers
           "From: Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen &lt;larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no&gt;\n")
</pre>
   <p>Then put the following split rule in <code>nnmail-split-fancy</code>
(see <a href="Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy Mail Splitting</a>):

<pre class="lisp">     (...
      (to "larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no"
          (| ("subject" "re:.*" "misc")
             ("references" ".*@.*" "misc")
             "spam"))
      ...)
</pre>
   <p>This says that all mail to this address is suspect, but if it has a
<code>Subject</code> that starts with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Re:</span></samp>&rsquo; or has a <code>References</code>
header, it's probably ok.  All the rest goes to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo; group. 
(This idea probably comes from Tim Pierce.)

   <p>In addition, many mail spammers talk directly to your <acronym>SMTP</acronym> server
and do not include your email address explicitly in the <code>To</code>
header.  Why they do this is unknown&mdash;perhaps it's to thwart this
thwarting scheme?  In any case, this is trivial to deal with&mdash;you just
put anything not addressed to you in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo; group by ending
your fancy split rule in this way:

<pre class="lisp">     (
      ...
      (to "larsi" "misc")
      "spam")
</pre>
   <p>In my experience, this will sort virtually everything into the right
group.  You still have to check the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo; group from time to time to
check for legitimate mail, though.  If you feel like being a good net
citizen, you can even send off complaints to the proper authorities on
each unsolicited commercial email&mdash;at your leisure.

   <p>This works for me.  It allows people an easy way to contact me (they can
just press <kbd>r</kbd> in the usual way), and I'm not bothered at all with
spam.  It's a win-win situation.  Forging <code>From</code> headers to point
to non-existent domains is yucky, in my opinion.

   <p>Be careful with this approach.  Spammers are wise to it.
