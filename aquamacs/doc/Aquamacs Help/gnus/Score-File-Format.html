<h3 class="section">7.4 Score File Format</h3>

<p><a name="index-score-file-format-2649"></a>
A score file is an <code>emacs-lisp</code> file that normally contains just a
single form.  Casual users are not expected to edit these files;
everything can be changed from the summary buffer.

   <p>Anyway, if you'd like to dig into it yourself, here's an example:

<pre class="lisp">     (("from"
       ("Lars Ingebrigtsen" -10000)
       ("Per Abrahamsen")
       ("larsi\\|lmi" -50000 nil R))
      ("subject"
       ("Ding is Badd" nil 728373))
      ("xref"
       ("alt.politics" -1000 728372 s))
      ("lines"
       (2 -100 nil &lt;))
      (mark 0)
      (expunge -1000)
      (mark-and-expunge -10)
      (read-only nil)
      (orphan -10)
      (adapt t)
      (files "/hom/larsi/News/gnu.SCORE")
      (exclude-files "all.SCORE")
      (local (gnus-newsgroup-auto-expire t)
             (gnus-summary-make-false-root empty))
      (eval (ding)))
</pre>
   <p>This example demonstrates most score file elements.  See <a href="Advanced-Scoring.html#Advanced-Scoring">Advanced Scoring</a>, for a different approach.

   <p>Even though this looks much like Lisp code, nothing here is actually
<code>eval</code>ed.  The Lisp reader is used to read this form, though, so it
has to be valid syntactically, if not semantically.

   <p>Six keys are supported by this alist:

     <dl>
<dt><code>STRING</code><dd>If the key is a string, it is the name of the header to perform the
match on.  Scoring can only be performed on these eight headers:
<code>From</code>, <code>Subject</code>, <code>References</code>, <code>Message-ID</code>,
<code>Xref</code>, <code>Lines</code>, <code>Chars</code> and <code>Date</code>.  In addition to
these headers, there are three strings to tell Gnus to fetch the entire
article and do the match on larger parts of the article: <code>Body</code>
will perform the match on the body of the article, <code>Head</code> will
perform the match on the head of the article, and <code>All</code> will
perform the match on the entire article.  Note that using any of these
last three keys will slow down group entry <em>considerably</em>.  The
final &ldquo;header&rdquo; you can score on is <code>Followup</code>.  These score
entries will result in new score entries being added for all follow-ups
to articles that matches these score entries.

     <p>Following this key is an arbitrary number of score entries, where each
score entry has one to four elements.
          <ol type=1 start=1>

          <li>The first element is the <dfn>match element</dfn>.  On most headers this will
be a string, but on the Lines and Chars headers, this must be an
integer.

          <li>If the second element is present, it should be a number&mdash;the <dfn>score
element</dfn>.  This number should be an integer in the neginf to posinf
interval.  This number is added to the score of the article if the match
is successful.  If this element is not present, the
<code>gnus-score-interactive-default-score</code> number will be used
instead.  This is 1000 by default.

          <li>If the third element is present, it should be a number&mdash;the <dfn>date
element</dfn>.  This date says when the last time this score entry matched,
which provides a mechanism for expiring the score entries.  It this
element is not present, the score entry is permanent.  The date is
represented by the number of days since December 31, 1 BCE.

          <li>If the fourth element is present, it should be a symbol&mdash;the <dfn>type
element</dfn>.  This element specifies what function should be used to see
whether this score entry matches the article.  What match types that can
be used depends on what header you wish to perform the match on.
               <dl>
<dt><dfn>From, Subject, References, Xref, Message-ID</dfn><dd>For most header types, there are the <code>r</code> and <code>R</code> (regexp), as
well as <code>s</code> and <code>S</code> (substring) types, and <code>e</code> and
<code>E</code> (exact match), and <code>w</code> (word match) types.  If this
element is not present, Gnus will assume that substring matching should
be used.  <code>R</code>, <code>S</code>, and <code>E</code> differ from the others in
that the matches will be done in a case-sensitive manner.  All these
one-letter types are really just abbreviations for the <code>regexp</code>,
<code>string</code>, <code>exact</code>, and <code>word</code> types, which you can use
instead, if you feel like.

               <br><dt><dfn>Extra</dfn><dd>Just as for the standard string overview headers, if you are using
gnus-extra-headers, you can score on these headers' values.  In this
case, there is a 5th element in the score entry, being the name of the
header to be scored.  The following entry is useful in your
<samp><span class="file">all.SCORE</span></samp> file in case of spam attacks from a single origin
host, if your <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server tracks &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NNTP-Posting-Host</span></samp>&rsquo; in
overviews:

               <pre class="lisp">                    ("111.222.333.444" -1000 nil s
                     "NNTP-Posting-Host")
</pre>
               <br><dt><dfn>Lines, Chars</dfn><dd>These two headers use different match types: <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>,
<code>=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> and <code>&lt;=</code>.

               <p>These predicates are true if

               <pre class="example">                    (PREDICATE HEADER MATCH)
</pre>
               <p>evaluates to non-<code>nil</code>.  For instance, the advanced match
<code>("lines" 4 &lt;)</code> (see <a href="Advanced-Scoring.html#Advanced-Scoring">Advanced Scoring</a>) will result in the
following form:

               <pre class="lisp">                    (&lt; header-value 4)
</pre>
               <p>Or to put it another way: When using <code>&lt;</code> on <code>Lines</code> with 4 as
the match, we get the score added if the article has less than 4 lines. 
(It's easy to get confused and think it's the other way around.  But
it's not.  I think.)

               <p>When matching on <code>Lines</code>, be careful because some back ends (like
<code>nndir</code>) do not generate <code>Lines</code> header, so every article ends
up being marked as having 0 lines.  This can lead to strange results if
you happen to lower score of the articles with few lines.

               <br><dt><dfn>Date</dfn><dd>For the Date header we have three kinda silly match types:
<code>before</code>, <code>at</code> and <code>after</code>.  I can't really imagine this
ever being useful, but, like, it would feel kinda silly not to provide
this function.  Just in case.  You never know.  Better safe than sorry. 
Once burnt, twice shy.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  Never not have
sex on a first date.  (I have been told that at least one person, and I
quote, &ldquo;found this function indispensable&rdquo;, however.)

               <p><a name="index-ISO8601-2650"></a><a name="index-date-2651"></a>A more useful match type is <code>regexp</code>.  With it, you can match the
date string using a regular expression.  The date is normalized to
ISO8601 compact format first&mdash;<var>YYYYMMDD</var><code>T</code><var>HHMMSS</var>.  If
you want to match all articles that have been posted on April 1st in
every year, you could use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">....0401.........</span></samp>&rsquo; as a match string,
for instance.  (Note that the date is kept in its original time zone, so
this will match articles that were posted when it was April 1st where
the article was posted from.  Time zones are such wholesome fun for the
whole family, eh?)

               <br><dt><dfn>Head, Body, All</dfn><dd>These three match keys use the same match types as the <code>From</code> (etc)
header uses.

               <br><dt><dfn>Followup</dfn><dd>This match key is somewhat special, in that it will match the
<code>From</code> header, and affect the score of not only the matching
articles, but also all followups to the matching articles.  This allows
you e.g. increase the score of followups to your own articles, or
decrease the score of followups to the articles of some known
trouble-maker.  Uses the same match types as the <code>From</code> header
uses.  (Using this match key will lead to creation of <samp><span class="file">ADAPT</span></samp>
files.)

               <br><dt><dfn>Thread</dfn><dd>This match key works along the same lines as the <code>Followup</code> match
key.  If you say that you want to score on a (sub-)thread started by an
article with a <code>Message-ID</code> <var>x</var>, then you add a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread</span></samp>&rsquo;
match.  This will add a new &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread</span></samp>&rsquo; match for each article that
has <var>x</var> in its <code>References</code> header.  (These new &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thread</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches will use the <code>Message-ID</code>s of these matching articles.) 
This will ensure that you can raise/lower the score of an entire thread,
even though some articles in the thread may not have complete
<code>References</code> headers.  Note that using this may lead to
undeterministic scores of the articles in the thread.  (Using this match
key will lead to creation of <samp><span class="file">ADAPT</span></samp> files.) 
</dl>
          </ol>

     <p><a name="index-score-file-atoms-2652"></a><br><dt><code>mark</code><dd>The value of this entry should be a number.  Any articles with a score
lower than this number will be marked as read.

     <br><dt><code>expunge</code><dd>The value of this entry should be a number.  Any articles with a score
lower than this number will be removed from the summary buffer.

     <br><dt><code>mark-and-expunge</code><dd>The value of this entry should be a number.  Any articles with a score
lower than this number will be marked as read and removed from the
summary buffer.

     <br><dt><code>thread-mark-and-expunge</code><dd>The value of this entry should be a number.  All articles that belong to
a thread that has a total score below this number will be marked as read
and removed from the summary buffer.  <code>gnus-thread-score-function</code>
says how to compute the total score for a thread.

     <br><dt><code>files</code><dd>The value of this entry should be any number of file names.  These files
are assumed to be score files as well, and will be loaded the same way
this one was.

     <br><dt><code>exclude-files</code><dd>The clue of this entry should be any number of files.  These files will
not be loaded, even though they would normally be so, for some reason or
other.

     <br><dt><code>eval</code><dd>The value of this entry will be <code>eval</code>ed.  This element will be
ignored when handling global score files.

     <br><dt><code>read-only</code><dd>Read-only score files will not be updated or saved.  Global score files
should feature this atom (see <a href="Global-Score-Files.html#Global-Score-Files">Global Score Files</a>).  (Note:
<dfn>Global</dfn> here really means <dfn>global</dfn>; not your personal
apply-to-all-groups score files.)

     <br><dt><code>orphan</code><dd>The value of this entry should be a number.  Articles that do not have
parents will get this number added to their scores.  Imagine you follow
some high-volume newsgroup, like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">comp.lang.c</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Most likely you
will only follow a few of the threads, also want to see any new threads.

     <p>You can do this with the following two score file entries:

     <pre class="example">                  (orphan -500)
                  (mark-and-expunge -100)
</pre>
     <p>When you enter the group the first time, you will only see the new
threads.  You then raise the score of the threads that you find
interesting (with <kbd>I T</kbd> or <kbd>I S</kbd>), and ignore (<kbd>c y</kbd>) the
rest.  Next time you enter the group, you will see new articles in the
interesting threads, plus any new threads.

     <p>I.e.&mdash;the orphan score atom is for high-volume groups where a few
interesting threads which can't be found automatically by ordinary
scoring rules exist.

     <br><dt><code>adapt</code><dd>This entry controls the adaptive scoring.  If it is <code>t</code>, the
default adaptive scoring rules will be used.  If it is <code>ignore</code>, no
adaptive scoring will be performed on this group.  If it is a list, this
list will be used as the adaptive scoring rules.  If it isn't present,
or is something other than <code>t</code> or <code>ignore</code>, the default
adaptive scoring rules will be used.  If you want to use adaptive
scoring on most groups, you'd set <code>gnus-use-adaptive-scoring</code> to
<code>t</code>, and insert an <code>(adapt ignore)</code> in the groups where you do
not want adaptive scoring.  If you only want adaptive scoring in a few
groups, you'd set <code>gnus-use-adaptive-scoring</code> to <code>nil</code>, and
insert <code>(adapt t)</code> in the score files of the groups where you want
it.

     <br><dt><code>adapt-file</code><dd>All adaptive score entries will go to the file named by this entry.  It
will also be applied when entering the group.  This atom might be handy
if you want to adapt on several groups at once, using the same adaptive
file for a number of groups.

     <br><dt><code>local</code><dd><a name="index-local-variables-2653"></a>The value of this entry should be a list of <code>(</code><var>var</var>
<var>value</var><code>)</code> pairs.  Each <var>var</var> will be made buffer-local to the
current summary buffer, and set to the value specified.  This is a
convenient, if somewhat strange, way of setting variables in some
groups if you don't like hooks much.  Note that the <var>value</var> won't
be evaluated.
