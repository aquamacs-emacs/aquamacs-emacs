  <p><a name="index-terminology-2959" id=
  "index-terminology-2959"></a></p>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>news</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-news-2960" id="index-news-2960"></a>This is
    what you are supposed to use this thing for&mdash;reading news.
    News is generally fetched from a nearby <acronym>NNTP</acronym>
    server, and is generally publicly available to everybody. If
    you post news, the entire world is likely to read just what you
    have written, and they'll all snigger mischievously. Behind
    your back.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>mail</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-mail-2961" id=
    "index-mail-2961"></a>Everything that's delivered to you
    personally is mail. Some news/mail readers (like Gnus) blur the
    distinction between mail and news, but there is a difference.
    Mail is private. News is public. Mailing is not posting, and
    replying is not following up.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>reply</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-reply-2962" id="index-reply-2962"></a>Send a
    mail to the person who has written what you are
    reading.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>follow up</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-follow-up-2963" id=
    "index-follow-up-2963"></a>Post an article to the current
    newsgroup responding to the article you are reading.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>back end</dfn></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-back-end-2964" id=
      "index-back-end-2964"></a>Gnus considers mail and news to be
      mostly the same, really. The only difference is how to access
      the actual articles. News articles are commonly fetched via
      the protocol <acronym>NNTP</acronym>, whereas mail messages
      could be read from a file on the local disk. The internal
      architecture of Gnus thus comprises a &ldquo;front end&rdquo;
      and a number of &ldquo;back ends&rdquo;. Internally, when you
      enter a group (by hitting &lt;RET&gt;, say), you thereby
      invoke a function in the front end in Gnus. The front end
      then &ldquo;talks&rdquo; to a back end and says things like
      &ldquo;Give me the list of articles in the foo group&rdquo;
      or &ldquo;Show me article number 4711&rdquo;.

      <p>So a back end mainly defines either a protocol (the
      <code>nntp</code> back end accesses news via
      <acronym>NNTP</acronym>, the <code>nnimap</code> back end
      accesses mail via <acronym>IMAP</acronym>) or a file format
      and directory layout (the <code>nnspool</code> back end
      accesses news via the common &ldquo;spool directory&rdquo;
      format, the <code>nnml</code> back end access mail via a file
      format and directory layout that's quite similar).</p>

      <p>Gnus does not handle the underlying media, so to
      speak&mdash;this is all done by the back ends. A back end is
      a collection of functions to access the articles.</p>

      <p>However, sometimes the term &ldquo;back end&rdquo; is also
      used where &ldquo;server&rdquo; would have been more
      appropriate. And then there is the term &ldquo;select
      method&rdquo; which can mean either. The Gnus terminology can
      be quite confusing.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><dfn>native</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-native-2965" id="index-native-2965"></a>Gnus
    will always use one method (and back end) as the
    <dfn>native</dfn>, or default, way of getting news.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>foreign</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-foreign-2966" id=
    "index-foreign-2966"></a>You can also have any number of
    foreign groups active at the same time. These are groups that
    use non-native non-secondary back ends for getting
    news.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>secondary</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-secondary-2967" id=
    "index-secondary-2967"></a>Secondary back ends are somewhere
    half-way between being native and being foreign, but they
    mostly act like they are native.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>article</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-article-2968" id="index-article-2968"></a>A
    message that has been posted as news.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>mail message</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-mail-message-2969" id=
    "index-mail-message-2969"></a>A message that has been
    mailed.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>message</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-message-2970" id="index-message-2970"></a>A
    mail message or news article<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>head</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-head-2971" id="index-head-2971"></a>The top
    part of a message, where administrative information (etc.) is
    put.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>body</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-body-2972" id="index-body-2972"></a>The rest
    of an article. Everything not in the head is in the
    body.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>header</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-header-2973" id="index-header-2973"></a>A
    line from the head of an article.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>headers</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-headers-2974" id="index-headers-2974"></a>A
    collection of such lines, or a collection of heads. Or even a
    collection of <acronym>NOV</acronym> lines.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn><acronym>NOV</acronym></dfn></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bNOV_007d-2975" id=
      "index-g_t_0040acronym_007bNOV_007d-2975"></a><acronym>NOV</acronym>
      stands for News OverView, which is a type of news server
      header which provide datas containing the condensed header
      information of articles. They are produced by the server
      itself; in the <code>nntp</code> back end Gnus uses the ones
      that the <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server makes, but Gnus makes
      them by itself for some backends (in particular,
      <code>nnml</code>).

      <p>When Gnus enters a group, it asks the back end for the
      headers of all unread articles in the group. Most servers
      support the News OverView format, which is more compact and
      much faster to read and parse than the normal <span class=
      "sc">head</span> format.</p>

      <p>The <acronym>NOV</acronym> data consist of one or more
      text lines (see <a href=
      "../elisp/Text-Lines.html#Text-Lines">Motion by Text
      Lines</a>) where each line has the header information of one
      article. The header information is a tab-separated series of
      the header's contents including an article number, a subject,
      an author, a date, a message-id, references, etc.</p>

      <p>Those data enable Gnus to generate summary lines quickly.
      However, if the server does not support
      <acronym>NOV</acronym> or you disable it purposely or for
      some reason, Gnus will try to generate the header information
      by parsing each article's headers one by one. It will take
      time. Therefore, it is not usually a good idea to set
      nn*-nov-is-evil (see <a href=
      "Slow_002fExpensive-Connection.html#Slow_002fExpensive-Connection">
      Slow/Expensive Connection</a>) to a non-<code>nil</code>
      value unless you know that the server makes wrong
      <acronym>NOV</acronym> data.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><dfn>level</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-levels-2976" id="index-levels-2976"></a>Each
    group is subscribed at some <dfn>level</dfn> or other (1-9).
    The ones that have a lower level are &ldquo;more&rdquo;
    subscribed than the groups with a higher level. In fact, groups
    on levels 1-5 are considered <dfn>subscribed</dfn>; 6-7 are
    <dfn>unsubscribed</dfn>; 8 are <dfn>zombies</dfn>; and 9 are
    <dfn>killed</dfn>. Commands for listing groups and scanning for
    new articles will all use the numeric prefix as <dfn>working
    level</dfn>.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>killed groups</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-killed-groups-2977" id=
    "index-killed-groups-2977"></a>No information on killed groups
    is stored or updated, which makes killed groups much easier to
    handle than subscribed groups.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>zombie groups</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-zombie-groups-2978" id=
    "index-zombie-groups-2978"></a>Just like killed groups, only
    slightly less dead.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>active file</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-active-file-2979" id=
    "index-active-file-2979"></a>The news server has to keep track
    of what articles it carries, and what groups exist. All this
    information in stored in the active file, which is rather
    large, as you might surmise.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>bogus groups</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-bogus-groups-2980" id=
    "index-bogus-groups-2980"></a>A group that exists in the
    <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file, but isn't
    known to the server (i.e., it isn't in the active file), is a
    <em>bogus group</em>. This means that the group probably
    doesn't exist (any more).<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>activating</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-activating-groups-2981" id=
    "index-activating-groups-2981"></a>The act of asking the server
    for info on a group and computing the number of unread articles
    is called <dfn>activating the group</dfn>. Un-activated groups
    are listed with &lsquo;<samp><span class=
    "samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in the group buffer.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>spool</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-spool-2982" id="index-spool-2982"></a>News
    servers store their articles locally in one fashion or other.
    One old-fashioned storage method is to have just one file per
    article. That's called a &ldquo;traditional
    spool&rdquo;.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>server</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-server-2983" id="index-server-2983"></a>A
    machine one can connect to and get news (or mail)
    from.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>select method</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-select-method-2984" id=
    "index-select-method-2984"></a>A structure that specifies the
    back end, the server and the virtual server
    settings.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>virtual server</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-virtual-server-2985" id=
    "index-virtual-server-2985"></a>A named select method. Since a
    select method defines all there is to know about connecting to
    a (physical) server, taking the thing as a whole is a virtual
    server.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>washing</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-washing-2986" id=
    "index-washing-2986"></a>Taking a buffer and running it through
    a filter of some sort. The result will (more often than not) be
    cleaner and more pleasing than the original.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>ephemeral groups</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-ephemeral-groups-2987" id=
    "index-ephemeral-groups-2987"></a><a name=
    "index-temporary-groups-2988" id=
    "index-temporary-groups-2988"></a>Most groups store data on
    what articles you have read. <dfn>Ephemeral</dfn> groups are
    groups that will have no data stored&mdash;when you exit the
    group, it'll disappear into the aether.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>solid groups</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-solid-groups-2989" id=
    "index-solid-groups-2989"></a>This is the opposite of ephemeral
    groups. All groups listed in the group buffer are solid
    groups.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>sparse articles</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-sparse-articles-2990" id=
    "index-sparse-articles-2990"></a>These are article placeholders
    shown in the summary buffer when
    <code>gnus-build-sparse-threads</code> has been switched
    on.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>threading</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-threading-2991" id=
    "index-threading-2991"></a>To put responses to articles
    directly after the articles they respond to&mdash;in a
    hierarchical fashion.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>root</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-root-2992" id="index-root-2992"></a><a name=
    "index-thread-root-2993" id="index-thread-root-2993"></a>The
    first article in a thread is the root. It is the ancestor of
    all articles in the thread.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>parent</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-parent-2994" id="index-parent-2994"></a>An

    parent.<br /></dd>

    <dt><dfn>digest</dfn></dt>

    <dd><a name="index-digest-2996" id="index-digest-2996"></a>A
    collection of messages in one file. The most common digest
    format is specified by RFC 1153.<br /></dd>
