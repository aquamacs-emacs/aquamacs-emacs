<h3 class="section">8.5 Window Layout</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-layout-2736"></a>
No, there's nothing here about X, so be quiet.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002duse_002dfull_002dwindow-2737"></a>If <code>gnus-use-full-window</code> non-<code>nil</code>, Gnus will delete all
other windows and occupy the entire Emacs screen by itself.  It is
<code>t</code> by default.

   <p>Setting this variable to <code>nil</code> kinda works, but there are
glitches.  Use at your own peril.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dbuffer_002dconfiguration-2738"></a><code>gnus-buffer-configuration</code> describes how much space each Gnus
buffer should be given.  Here's an excerpt of this variable:

<pre class="lisp">     ((group (vertical 1.0 (group 1.0 point)
                           (if gnus-carpal (group-carpal 4))))
      (article (vertical 1.0 (summary 0.25 point)
                             (article 1.0))))
</pre>
   <p>This is an alist.  The <dfn>key</dfn> is a symbol that names some action or
other.  For instance, when displaying the group buffer, the window
configuration function will use <code>group</code> as the key.  A full list of
possible names is listed below.

   <p>The <dfn>value</dfn> (i.e., the <dfn>split</dfn>) says how much space each buffer
should occupy.  To take the <code>article</code> split as an example -

<pre class="lisp">     (article (vertical 1.0 (summary 0.25 point)
                            (article 1.0)))
</pre>
   <p>This <dfn>split</dfn> says that the summary buffer should occupy 25% of upper
half of the screen, and that it is placed over the article buffer.  As
you may have noticed, 100% + 25% is actually 125% (yup, I saw y'all
reaching for that calculator there).  However, the special number
<code>1.0</code> is used to signal that this buffer should soak up all the
rest of the space available after the rest of the buffers have taken
whatever they need.  There should be only one buffer with the <code>1.0</code>
size spec per split.

   <p>Point will be put in the buffer that has the optional third element
<code>point</code>.  In a <code>frame</code> split, the last subsplit having a leaf
split where the tag <code>frame-focus</code> is a member (i.e. is the third or
fourth element in the list, depending on whether the <code>point</code> tag is
present) gets focus.

   <p>Here's a more complicated example:

<pre class="lisp">     (article (vertical 1.0 (group 4)
                            (summary 0.25 point)
                            (if gnus-carpal (summary-carpal 4))
                            (article 1.0)))
</pre>
   <p>If the size spec is an integer instead of a floating point number,
then that number will be used to say how many lines a buffer should
occupy, not a percentage.

   <p>If the <dfn>split</dfn> looks like something that can be <code>eval</code>ed (to be
precise&mdash;if the <code>car</code> of the split is a function or a subr), this
split will be <code>eval</code>ed.  If the result is non-<code>nil</code>, it will
be used as a split.  This means that there will be three buffers if
<code>gnus-carpal</code> is <code>nil</code>, and four buffers if <code>gnus-carpal</code>
is non-<code>nil</code>.

   <p>Not complicated enough for you?  Well, try this on for size:

<pre class="lisp">     (article (horizontal 1.0
                  (vertical 0.5
                      (group 1.0)
                      (gnus-carpal 4))
                  (vertical 1.0
                      (summary 0.25 point)
                      (summary-carpal 4)
                      (article 1.0))))
</pre>
   <p>Whoops.  Two buffers with the mystery 100% tag.  And what's that
<code>horizontal</code> thingie?

   <p>If the first element in one of the split is <code>horizontal</code>, Gnus will
split the window horizontally, giving you two windows side-by-side. 
Inside each of these strips you may carry on all you like in the normal
fashion.  The number following <code>horizontal</code> says what percentage of
the screen is to be given to this strip.

   <p>For each split, there <em>must</em> be one element that has the 100% tag. 
The splitting is never accurate, and this buffer will eat any leftover
lines from the splits.

   <p>To be slightly more formal, here's a definition of what a valid split
may look like:

<pre class="example">     split      = frame | horizontal | vertical | buffer | form
     frame      = "(frame " size *split ")"
     horizontal = "(horizontal " size *split ")"
     vertical   = "(vertical " size *split ")"
     buffer     = "(" buf-name " " size *[ "point" ] *[ "frame-focus"] ")"
     size       = number | frame-params
     buf-name   = group | article | summary ...
</pre>
   <p>The limitations are that the <code>frame</code> split can only appear as the
top-level split.  <var>form</var> should be an Emacs Lisp form that should
return a valid split.  We see that each split is fully recursive, and
may contain any number of <code>vertical</code> and <code>horizontal</code> splits.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dwindow_002dmin_002dwidth-2739"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dwindow_002dmin_002dheight-2740"></a><a name="index-window-height-2741"></a><a name="index-window-width-2742"></a>Finding the right sizes can be a bit complicated.  No window may be less
than <code>gnus-window-min-height</code> (default 1) characters high, and all
windows must be at least <code>gnus-window-min-width</code> (default 1)
characters wide.  Gnus will try to enforce this before applying the
splits.  If you want to use the normal Emacs window width/height limit,
you can just set these two variables to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>If you're not familiar with Emacs terminology, <code>horizontal</code> and
<code>vertical</code> splits may work the opposite way of what you'd expect. 
Windows inside a <code>horizontal</code> split are shown side-by-side, and
windows within a <code>vertical</code> split are shown above each other.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dconfigure_002dframe-2743"></a>If you want to experiment with window placement, a good tip is to call
<code>gnus-configure-frame</code> directly with a split.  This is the function
that does all the real work when splitting buffers.  Below is a pretty
nonsensical configuration with 5 windows; two for the group buffer and
three for the article buffer.  (I said it was nonsensical.)  If you
<code>eval</code> the statement below, you can get an idea of how that would
look straight away, without going through the normal Gnus channels. 
Play with it until you're satisfied, and then use
<code>gnus-add-configuration</code> to add your new creation to the buffer
configuration list.

<pre class="lisp">     (gnus-configure-frame
      '(horizontal 1.0
         (vertical 10
           (group 1.0)
           (article 0.3 point))
         (vertical 1.0
           (article 1.0)
           (horizontal 4
             (group 1.0)
             (article 10)))))
</pre>
   <p>You might want to have several frames as well.  No prob&mdash;just use the
<code>frame</code> split:

<pre class="lisp">     (gnus-configure-frame
      '(frame 1.0
              (vertical 1.0
                        (summary 0.25 point frame-focus)
                        (article 1.0))
              (vertical ((height . 5) (width . 15)
                         (user-position . t)
                         (left . -1) (top . 1))
                        (picon 1.0))))
     
</pre>
   <p>This split will result in the familiar summary/article window
configuration in the first (or &ldquo;main&rdquo;) frame, while a small additional
frame will be created where picons will be shown.  As you can see,
instead of the normal <code>1.0</code> top-level spec, each additional split
should have a frame parameter alist as the size spec. 
See <a href="../elisp/Frame-Parameters.html#Frame-Parameters">Frame Parameters</a>.  Under XEmacs, a frame property list will be
accepted, too&mdash;for instance, <code>(height 5 width 15 left -1 top 1)</code>
is such a plist. 
The list of all possible keys for <code>gnus-buffer-configuration</code> can
be found in its default value.

   <p>Note that the <code>message</code> key is used for both
<code>gnus-group-mail</code> and <code>gnus-summary-mail-other-window</code>.  If
it is desirable to distinguish between the two, something like this
might be used:

<pre class="lisp">     (message (horizontal 1.0
                          (vertical 1.0 (message 1.0 point))
                          (vertical 0.24
                                    (if (buffer-live-p gnus-summary-buffer)
                                        '(summary 0.5))
                                    (group 1.0))))
</pre>
   <p>One common desire for a multiple frame split is to have a separate frame
for composing mail and news while leaving the original frame intact.  To
accomplish that, something like the following can be done:

<pre class="lisp">     (message
       (frame 1.0
              (if (not (buffer-live-p gnus-summary-buffer))
                  (car (cdr (assoc 'group gnus-buffer-configuration)))
                (car (cdr (assoc 'summary gnus-buffer-configuration))))
              (vertical ((user-position . t) (top . 1) (left . 1)
                         (name . "Message"))
                        (message 1.0 point))))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dadd_002dconfiguration-2744"></a>Since the <code>gnus-buffer-configuration</code> variable is so long and
complicated, there's a function you can use to ease changing the config
of a single setting: <code>gnus-add-configuration</code>.  If, for instance,
you want to change the <code>article</code> setting, you could say:

<pre class="lisp">     (gnus-add-configuration
      '(article (vertical 1.0
                    (group 4)
                    (summary .25 point)
                    (article 1.0))))
</pre>
   <p>You'd typically stick these <code>gnus-add-configuration</code> calls in your
<samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> file or in some startup hook&mdash;they should be run after
Gnus has been loaded.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002dalways_002dforce_002dwindow_002dconfiguration-2745"></a>If all windows mentioned in the configuration are already visible, Gnus
won't change the window configuration.  If you always want to force the
&ldquo;right&rdquo; window configuration, you can set
<code>gnus-always-force-window-configuration</code> to non-<code>nil</code>.

   <p>If you're using tree displays (see <a href="Tree-Display.html#Tree-Display">Tree Display</a>), and the tree
window is displayed vertically next to another window, you may also want
to fiddle with <code>gnus-tree-minimize-window</code> to avoid having the
windows resized.

<h4 class="subsection">8.5.1 Example Window Configurations</h4>
