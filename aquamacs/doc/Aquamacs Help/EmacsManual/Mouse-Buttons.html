  <p>Emacs uses Lisp symbols to designate mouse buttons, too. The
  ordinary mouse events in Emacs are <em>click</em> events; these
  happen when you press a button and release it without moving the
  mouse. You can also get <em>drag</em> events, when you move the
  mouse while holding the button down. Drag events happen when you
  finally let go of the button.</p>

  <p>The symbols for basic click events are <code>mouse-1</code>
  for the leftmost button, <code>mouse-2</code> for the next, and
  so on. Here is how you can redefine the second mouse button to
  split the current window:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(global-set-key [mouse-2] 'split-window-below)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The symbols for drag events are similar, but have the prefix
  &lsquo;<samp>drag-</samp>&rsquo; before the word
  &lsquo;<samp>mouse</samp>&rsquo;. For example, dragging the first
  button generates a <code>drag-mouse-1</code> event.</p>

  <p>You can also define bindings for events that occur when a
  mouse button is pressed down. These events start with
  &lsquo;<samp>down-</samp>&rsquo; instead of
  &lsquo;<samp>drag-</samp>&rsquo;. Such events are generated only
  if they have key bindings. When you get a button-down event, a
  corresponding click or drag event will always follow.</p><a name=
  "index-double-clicks" id="index-double-clicks"></a> <a name=
  "index-triple-clicks" id="index-triple-clicks"></a>

  <p>If you wish, you can distinguish single, double, and triple
  clicks. A double click means clicking a mouse button twice in
  approximately the same place. The first click generates an
  ordinary click event. The second click, if it comes soon enough,
  generates a double-click event instead. The event type for a
  double-click event starts with
  &lsquo;<samp>double-</samp>&rsquo;: for example,
  <code>double-mouse-3</code>.</p>

  <p>This means that you can give a special meaning to the second
  click at the same place, but it must act on the assumption that
  the ordinary single click definition has run when the first click
  was received.</p>

  <p>This constrains what you can do with double clicks, but user
  interface designers say that this constraint ought to be followed
  in any case. A double click should do something similar to the
  single click, only more so. The command for the double-click
  event should perform the extra work for the double click.</p>

  <p>If a double-click event has no binding, it changes to the
  corresponding single-click event. Thus, if you don&rsquo;t define
  a particular double click specially, it executes the single-click
  command twice.</p>

  <p>Emacs also supports triple-click events whose names start with
  &lsquo;<samp>triple-</samp>&rsquo;. Emacs does not distinguish
  quadruple clicks as event types; clicks beyond the third generate
  additional triple-click events. However, the full number of
  clicks is recorded in the event list, so if you know Emacs Lisp
  you can distinguish if you really want to (see <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Click-Events.html#Click-Events">
  Click Events</a> in <cite>The Emacs Lisp Reference
  Manual</cite>). We don&rsquo;t recommend distinct meanings for
  more than three clicks, but sometimes it is useful for subsequent
  clicks to cycle through the same set of three meanings, so that
  four clicks are equivalent to one click, five are equivalent to
  two, and six are equivalent to three.</p>

  <p>Emacs also records multiple presses in drag and button-down
  events. For example, when you press a button twice, then move the
  mouse while holding the button, Emacs gets a
  &lsquo;<samp>double-drag-</samp>&rsquo; event. And at the moment
  when you press it down for the second time, Emacs gets a
  &lsquo;<samp>double-down-</samp>&rsquo; event (which is ignored,
  like all button-down events, if it has no binding).</p><a name=
  "index-double_002dclick_002dtime" id=
  "index-double_002dclick_002dtime"></a>

  <p>The variable <code>double-click-time</code> specifies how much
  time can elapse between clicks and still allow them to be grouped
  as a multiple click. Its value is in units of milliseconds. If
  the value is <code>nil</code>, double clicks are not detected at
  all. If the value is <code>t</code>, then there is no time limit.
  The default is 500.</p><a name="index-double_002dclick_002dfuzz"
  id="index-double_002dclick_002dfuzz"></a>

  <p>The variable <code>double-click-fuzz</code> specifies how much
  the mouse can move between clicks and still allow them to be
  grouped as a multiple click. Its value is in units of pixels on
  windowed displays and in units of 1/8 of a character cell on
  text-mode terminals; the default is 3.</p>

  <p>The symbols for mouse events also indicate the status of the
  modifier keys, with the usual prefixes
  &lsquo;<samp>C-</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>M-</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>H-</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>s-</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>A-</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>S-</samp>&rsquo;.
  These always precede &lsquo;<samp>double-</samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp>triple-</samp>&rsquo;, which always precede
  &lsquo;<samp>drag-</samp>&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;<samp>down-</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>A frame includes areas that don&rsquo;t show text from the
  buffer, such as the mode line and the scroll bar. You can tell
  whether a mouse button comes from a special area of the screen by
  means of dummy prefix keys. For example, if you click the mouse
  in the mode line, you get the prefix key <code>mode-line</code>
  before the ordinary mouse-button symbol. Thus, here is how to
  define the command for clicking the first button in a mode line
  to run <code>scroll-up-command</code>:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(global-set-key [mode-line mouse-1] 'scroll-up-command)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here is the complete list of these dummy prefix keys and their
  meanings:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt><code>mode-line</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The mouse was in the mode line of a window.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>vertical-line</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The mouse was in the vertical line separating side-by-side
      windows. (If you use scroll bars, they appear in place of
      these vertical lines.)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>vertical-scroll-bar</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The mouse was in a vertical scroll bar. (This is the only
      kind of scroll bar Emacs currently supports.)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>menu-bar</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The mouse was in the menu bar.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>header-line</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The mouse was in a header line.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>You can put more than one mouse button in a key sequence, but
  it isn&rsquo;t usual to do so.</p>
