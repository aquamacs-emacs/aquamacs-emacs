  <h4 class="subsection">28.5.1 Overview of Emerge</h4>

  <p>To start Emerge, run one of these four commands:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt><kbd>M-x emerge-files</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-emerge_002dfiles" id=
      "index-emerge_002dfiles"></a>

      <p>Merge two specified files.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>M-x emerge-files-with-ancestor</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-emerge_002dfiles_002dwith_002dancestor" id=
      "index-emerge_002dfiles_002dwith_002dancestor"></a>

      <p>Merge two specified files, with reference to a common
      ancestor.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>M-x emerge-buffers</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-emerge_002dbuffers" id=
      "index-emerge_002dbuffers"></a>

      <p>Merge two buffers.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>M-x emerge-buffers-with-ancestor</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-emerge_002dbuffers_002dwith_002dancestor" id=
      "index-emerge_002dbuffers_002dwith_002dancestor"></a>

      <p>Merge two buffers with reference to a common ancestor in a
      third buffer.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl><a name="index-merge-buffer-_0028Emerge_0029" id=
  "index-merge-buffer-_0028Emerge_0029"></a> <a name=
  "index-A-and-B-buffers-_0028Emerge_0029" id=
  "index-A-and-B-buffers-_0028Emerge_0029"></a>

  <p>The Emerge commands compare two files or buffers, and display
  the comparison in three buffers: one for each input text (the
  <em>A buffer</em> and the <em>B buffer</em>), and one (the
  <em>merge buffer</em>) where merging takes place. The merge
  buffer shows the full merged text, not just the differences.
  Wherever the two input texts differ, you can choose which one of
  them to include in the merge buffer.</p>

  <p>The Emerge commands that take input from existing buffers use
  only the accessible portions of those buffers, if they are
  narrowed. See <a href=
  "Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.</p>

  <p>If a common ancestor version is available, from which the two
  texts to be merged were both derived, Emerge can use it to guess
  which alternative is right. Wherever one current version agrees
  with the ancestor, Emerge presumes that the other current version
  is a deliberate change which should be kept in the merged
  version. Use the &lsquo;<samp>with-ancestor</samp>&rsquo;
  commands if you want to specify a common ancestor text. These
  commands read three file or buffer names&mdash;variant A, variant
  B, and the common ancestor.</p>

  <p>After the comparison is done and the buffers are prepared, the
  interactive merging starts. You control the merging by typing
  special <em>merge commands</em> in the merge buffer (see <a href=
  "Merge-Commands.html#Merge-Commands">Merge Commands</a>). For
  each run of differences between the input texts, you can choose
  which one of them to keep, or edit them both together.</p>

  <p>The merge buffer uses a special major mode, Emerge mode, with
  commands for making these choices. But you can also edit the
  buffer with ordinary Emacs commands.</p>

  <p>At any given time, the attention of Emerge is focused on one
  particular difference, called the <em>selected</em> difference.
  This difference is marked off in the three buffers like this:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
<var>text that differs</var>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Emerge numbers all the differences sequentially and the mode
  line always shows the number of the selected difference.</p>

  <p>Normally, the merge buffer starts out with the A version of
  the text. But when the A version of a difference agrees with the
  common ancestor, then the B version is initially preferred for
  that difference.</p>

  <p>Emerge leaves the merged text in the merge buffer when you
  exit. At that point, you can save it in a file with <kbd>C-x
  C-w</kbd>. If you give a numeric argument to
  <code>emerge-files</code> or
  <code>emerge-files-with-ancestor</code>, it reads the name of the
  output file using the minibuffer. (This is the last file name
  those commands read.) Then exiting from Emerge saves the merged
  text in the output file.</p>

  <p>Normally, Emerge commands save the output buffer in its file
  when you exit. If you abort Emerge with <kbd>C-]</kbd>, the
  Emerge command does not save the output buffer, but you can save
  it yourself if you wish.</p>
