  <h4 class="subsection">51.1.7 Custom Themes</h4><a name=
  "index-custom-themes" id="index-custom-themes"></a>

  <p><em>Custom themes</em> are collections of settings that can be
  enabled or disabled as a unit. You can use Custom themes to
  switch easily between various collections of settings, and to
  transfer such collections from one computer to another.</p>

  <p>A Custom theme is stored as an Emacs Lisp source file. If the
  name of the Custom theme is <var>name</var>, the theme file is
  named <samp><var>name</var>-theme.el</samp>. See <a href=
  "Creating-Custom-Themes.html#Creating-Custom-Themes">Creating
  Custom Themes</a>, for the format of a theme file and how to make
  one.</p><a name="index-customize_002dthemes" id=
  "index-customize_002dthemes"></a> <a name=
  "index-custom_002dtheme_002ddirectory" id=
  "index-custom_002dtheme_002ddirectory"></a> <a name=
  "index-color-scheme" id="index-color-scheme"></a>

  <p>Type <kbd>M-x customize-themes</kbd> to switch to a buffer
  named <samp>*Custom Themes*</samp>, which lists the Custom themes
  that Emacs knows about. By default, Emacs looks for theme files
  in two locations: the directory specified by the variable
  <code>custom-theme-directory</code> (which defaults to
  <samp>~/.emacs.d/</samp>), and a directory named
  <samp>etc/themes</samp> in your Emacs installation (see the
  variable <code>data-directory</code>). The latter contains
  several Custom themes which are distributed with Emacs, which
  customize Emacs&rsquo;s faces to fit various color schemes.
  (Note, however, that Custom themes need not be restricted to this
  purpose; they can be used to customize variables
  too.)</p><a name="index-custom_002dtheme_002dload_002dpath" id=
  "index-custom_002dtheme_002dload_002dpath"></a>

  <p>If you want Emacs to look for Custom themes in some other
  directory, add the directory name to the list variable
  <code>custom-theme-load-path</code>. Its default value is
  <code>(custom-theme-directory t)</code>; here, the symbol
  <code>custom-theme-directory</code> has the special meaning of
  the value of the variable <code>custom-theme-directory</code>,
  while <code>t</code> stands for the built-in theme directory
  <samp>etc/themes</samp>. The themes listed in the <samp>*Custom
  Themes*</samp> buffer are those found in the directories
  specified by <code>custom-theme-load-path</code>.</p><a name=
  "index-C_002dx-C_002ds-_0028Custom-Themes-buffer_0029" id=
  "index-C_002dx-C_002ds-_0028Custom-Themes-buffer_0029"></a>

  <p>In the <samp>*Custom Themes*</samp> buffer, you can activate
  the checkbox next to a Custom theme to enable or disable the
  theme for the current Emacs session. When a Custom theme is
  enabled, all of its settings (variables and faces) take effect in
  the Emacs session. To apply the choice of theme(s) to future
  Emacs sessions, type <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>
  (<code>custom-theme-save</code>) or use the &lsquo;<samp>[Save
  Theme Settings]</samp>&rsquo; button.</p><a name=
  "index-custom_002dsafe_002dthemes" id=
  "index-custom_002dsafe_002dthemes"></a>

  <p>When you first enable a Custom theme, Emacs displays the
  contents of the theme file and asks if you really want to load
  it. Because loading a Custom theme can execute arbitrary Lisp
  code, you should only say yes if you know that the theme is safe;
  in that case, Emacs offers to remember in the future that the
  theme is safe (this is done by saving the theme file&rsquo;s
  SHA-256 hash to the variable <code>custom-safe-themes</code>; if
  you want to treat all themes as safe, change its value to
  <code>t</code>). Themes that come with Emacs (in the
  <samp>etc/themes</samp> directory) are exempt from this check,
  and are always considered safe.</p><a name=
  "index-custom_002denabled_002dthemes" id=
  "index-custom_002denabled_002dthemes"></a>

  <p>Setting or saving Custom themes actually works by customizing
  the variable <code>custom-enabled-themes</code>. The value of
  this variable is a list of Custom theme names (as Lisp symbols,
  e.g., <code>tango</code>). Instead of using the <samp>*Custom
  Themes*</samp> buffer to set <code>custom-enabled-themes</code>,
  you can customize the variable using the usual customization
  interface, e.g., with <kbd>M-x customize-option</kbd>. Note that
  Custom themes are not allowed to set
  <code>custom-enabled-themes</code> themselves.</p>

  <p>Any customizations that you make through the customization
  buffer take precedence over theme settings. This lets you easily
  override individual theme settings that you disagree with. If
  settings from two different themes overlap, the theme occurring
  earlier in <code>custom-enabled-themes</code> takes precedence.
  In the customization buffer, if a setting has been changed from
  its default by a Custom theme, its
  &lsquo;<samp>State</samp>&rsquo; display shows
  &lsquo;<samp>THEMED</samp>&rsquo; instead of
  &lsquo;<samp>STANDARD</samp>&rsquo;.</p><a name=
  "index-load_002dtheme" id="index-load_002dtheme"></a> <a name=
  "index-enable_002dtheme" id="index-enable_002dtheme"></a>
  <a name="index-disable_002dtheme" id=
  "index-disable_002dtheme"></a>

  <p>You can enable a specific Custom theme in the current Emacs
  session by typing <kbd>M-x load-theme</kbd>. This prompts for a
  theme name, loads the theme from the theme file, and enables it.
  If a theme file has been loaded before, you can enable the theme
  without loading its file by typing <kbd>M-x enable-theme</kbd>.
  To disable a Custom theme, type <kbd>M-x
  disable-theme</kbd>.</p><a name="index-describe_002dtheme" id=
  "index-describe_002dtheme"></a>

  <p>To see a description of a Custom theme, type <kbd>?</kbd> on
  its line in the <samp>*Custom Themes*</samp> buffer; or type
  <kbd>M-x describe-theme</kbd> anywhere in Emacs and enter the
  theme name.</p>
