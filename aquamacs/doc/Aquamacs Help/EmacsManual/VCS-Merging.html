  <h4 class="subsubsection">28.1.1.4 Merge-based vs lock-based
  Version Control</h4>

  <p>A version control system typically has some mechanism to
  coordinate between users who want to change the same file. There
  are two ways to do this: merging and locking.</p><a name=
  "index-merging_002dbased-version" id=
  "index-merging_002dbased-version"></a>

  <p>In a version control system that uses merging, each user may
  modify a work file at any time. The system lets you
  <em>merge</em> your work file, which may contain changes that
  have not been committed, with the latest changes that others have
  committed.</p><a name="index-locking_002dbased-version" id=
  "index-locking_002dbased-version"></a>

  <p>Older version control systems use a <em>locking</em> scheme
  instead. Here, work files are normally read-only. To edit a file,
  you ask the version control system to make it writable for you by
  <em>locking</em> it; only one user can lock a given file at any
  given time. This procedure is analogous to, but different from,
  the locking that Emacs uses to detect simultaneous editing of
  ordinary files (see <a href=
  "Interlocking.html#Interlocking">Interlocking</a>). When you
  commit your changes, that unlocks the file, and the work file
  becomes read-only again. Other users may then lock the file to
  make their own changes.</p>

  <p>Both locking and merging systems can have problems when
  multiple users try to modify the same file at the same time.
  Locking systems have <em>lock conflicts</em>; a user may try to
  check a file out and be unable to because it is locked. In
  merging systems, <em>merge conflicts</em> happen when you commit
  a change to a file that conflicts with a change committed by
  someone else after your checkout. Both kinds of conflict have to
  be resolved by human judgment and communication. Experience has
  shown that merging is superior to locking, both in convenience to
  developers and in minimizing the number and severity of conflicts
  that actually occur.</p>

  <p>SCCS always uses locking. RCS is lock-based by default but can
  be told to operate in a merging style. CVS and Subversion are
  merge-based by default but can be told to operate in a locking
  mode. Decentralized version control systems, such as Git and
  Mercurial, are exclusively merging-based.</p>

  <p>VC mode supports both locking and merging version control. The
  terms &ldquo;commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;update&rdquo; are used in
  newer version control systems; older lock-based systems use the
  terms &ldquo;check in&rdquo; and &ldquo;check out&rdquo;. VC
  hides the differences between them as much as possible.</p>
