  <h4 class="subsection">31.9.1 Supported Calendar
  Systems</h4><a name="index-ISO-commercial-calendar" id=
  "index-ISO-commercial-calendar"></a>

  <p>The ISO commercial calendar is often used in
  business.</p><a name="index-Julian-calendar" id=
  "index-Julian-calendar"></a>

  <p>The Julian calendar, named after Julius Caesar, was the one
  used in Europe throughout medieval times, and in many countries
  up until the nineteenth century.</p><a name=
  "index-Julian-day-numbers" id="index-Julian-day-numbers"></a>
  <a name="index-astronomical-day-numbers" id=
  "index-astronomical-day-numbers"></a>

  <p>Astronomers use a simple counting of days elapsed since noon,
  Monday, January 1, 4713 B.C. on the Julian calendar. The number
  of days elapsed is called the <em>Julian day number</em> or the
  <em>Astronomical day number</em>.</p><a name=
  "index-Hebrew-calendar" id="index-Hebrew-calendar"></a>

  <p>The Hebrew calendar is used by tradition in the Jewish
  religion. The Emacs calendar program uses the Hebrew calendar to
  determine the dates of Jewish holidays. Hebrew calendar dates
  begin and end at sunset.</p><a name="index-Islamic-calendar" id=
  "index-Islamic-calendar"></a>

  <p>The Islamic calendar is used in many predominantly Islamic
  countries. Emacs uses it to determine the dates of Islamic
  holidays. There is no universal agreement in the Islamic world
  about the calendar; Emacs uses a widely accepted version, but the
  precise dates of Islamic holidays often depend on proclamation by
  religious authorities, not on calculations. As a consequence, the
  actual dates of observance can vary slightly from the dates
  computed by Emacs. Islamic calendar dates begin and end at
  sunset.</p><a name="index-French-Revolutionary-calendar" id=
  "index-French-Revolutionary-calendar"></a>

  <p>The French Revolutionary calendar was created by the Jacobins
  after the 1789 revolution, to represent a more secular and
  nature-based view of the annual cycle, and to install a 10-day
  week in a rationalization measure similar to the metric system.
  The French government officially abandoned this calendar at the
  end of 1805.</p><a name="index-Mayan-calendar" id=
  "index-Mayan-calendar"></a>

  <p>The Maya of Central America used three separate, overlapping
  calendar systems, the <em>long count</em>, the <em>tzolkin</em>,
  and the <em>haab</em>. Emacs knows about all three of these
  calendars. Experts dispute the exact correlation between the
  Mayan calendar and our calendar; Emacs uses the
  Goodman-Martinez-Thompson correlation in its
  calculations.</p><a name="index-Coptic-calendar" id=
  "index-Coptic-calendar"></a> <a name="index-Ethiopic-calendar"
  id="index-Ethiopic-calendar"></a>

  <p>The Copts use a calendar based on the ancient Egyptian solar
  calendar. Their calendar consists of twelve 30-day months
  followed by an extra five-day period. Once every fourth year they
  add a leap day to this extra period to make it six days. The
  Ethiopic calendar is identical in structure, but has different
  year numbers and month names.</p><a name="index-Persian-calendar"
  id="index-Persian-calendar"></a>

  <p>The Persians use a solar calendar based on a design of Omar
  Khayyam. Their calendar consists of twelve months of which the
  first six have 31 days, the next five have 30 days, and the last
  has 29 in ordinary years and 30 in leap years. Leap years occur
  in a complicated pattern every four or five years. The calendar
  implemented here is the arithmetical Persian calendar championed
  by Birashk, based on a 2,820-year cycle. It differs from the
  astronomical Persian calendar, which is based on astronomical
  events. As of this writing the first future discrepancy is
  projected to occur on March 20, 2025. It is currently not clear
  what the official calendar of Iran will be at that
  time.</p><a name="index-Chinese-calendar" id=
  "index-Chinese-calendar"></a>

  <p>The Chinese calendar is a complicated system of lunar months
  arranged into solar years. The years go in cycles of sixty, each
  year containing either twelve months in an ordinary year or
  thirteen months in a leap year; each month has either 29 or 30
  days. Years, ordinary months, and days are named by combining one
  of ten <em>celestial stems</em> with one of twelve
  <em>terrestrial branches</em> for a total of sixty names that are
  repeated in a cycle of sixty.</p><a name=
  "index-Baha_0027i-calendar" id="index-Baha_0027i-calendar"></a>

  <p>The Bah&Atilde;&iexcl;&rsquo;&Atilde;&shy; calendar system is
  based on a solar cycle of 19 months with 19 days each. The four
  remaining intercalary days are placed between the 18th and 19th
  months.</p>
