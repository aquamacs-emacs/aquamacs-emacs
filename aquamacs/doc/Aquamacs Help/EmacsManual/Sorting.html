  <h2 class="chapter">43 Sorting Text</h2><a name="index-sorting"
  id="index-sorting"></a>

  <p>Emacs provides several commands for sorting text in the
  buffer. All operate on the contents of the region. They divide
  the text of the region into many <em>sort records</em>, identify
  a <em>sort key</em> for each record, and then reorder the records
  into the order determined by the sort keys. The records are
  ordered so that their keys are in alphabetical order, or, for
  numeric sorting, in numeric order. In alphabetic sorting, all
  upper-case letters &lsquo;<samp>A</samp>&rsquo; through
  &lsquo;<samp>Z</samp>&rsquo; come before lower-case
  &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, in accordance with the
  <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character sequence.</p>

  <p>The various sort commands differ in how they divide the text
  into sort records and in which part of each record is used as the
  sort key. Most of the commands make each line a separate sort
  record, but some commands use paragraphs or pages as sort
  records. Most of the sort commands use each entire sort record as
  its own sort key, but some use only a portion of the record as
  the sort key.</p><a name="index-sort_002dlines" id=

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt><kbd>M-x sort-lines</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Divide the region into lines, and sort by comparing the
      entire text of a line. A numeric argument means sort into
      descending order.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>M-x sort-paragraphs</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Divide the region into paragraphs, and sort by comparing
      the entire text of a paragraph (except for leading blank
      lines). A numeric argument means sort into descending
      order.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>M-x sort-pages</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Divide the region into pages, and sort by comparing the
      entire text of a page (except for leading blank lines). A
      numeric argument means sort into descending order.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>M-x sort-fields</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Divide the region into lines, and sort by comparing the
      contents of one field in each line. Fields are defined as
      separated by whitespace, so the first run of consecutive
      non-whitespace characters in a line constitutes field 1, the
      second such run constitutes field 2, etc.</p>

      <p>Specify which field to sort by with a numeric argument: 1
      to sort by field 1, etc. A negative argument means count
      fields from the right instead of from the left; thus, minus 1
      means sort by the last field. If several lines have identical
      contents in the field being sorted, they keep the same
      relative order that they had in the original buffer.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>M-x sort-numeric-fields</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Like <kbd>M-x sort-fields</kbd> except the specified field
      is converted to an integer for each line, and the numbers are
      compared. &lsquo;<samp>10</samp>&rsquo; comes before
      &lsquo;<samp>2</samp>&rsquo; when considered as text, but
      after it when considered as a number. By default, numbers are
      interpreted according to <code>sort-numeric-base</code>, but
      numbers beginning with &lsquo;<samp>0x</samp>&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;<samp>0</samp>&rsquo; are interpreted as hexadecimal
      and octal, respectively.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>M-x sort-columns</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Like <kbd>M-x sort-fields</kbd> except that the text
      within each line used for comparison comes from a fixed range
      of columns. With a prefix argument, sort in reverse order.
      See below for more details on this command.</p><a name=
      "index-reverse_002dregion" id="index-reverse_002dregion"></a>
    </dd>

    <dt><kbd>M-x reverse-region</kbd></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Reverse the order of the lines in the region. This is
      useful for sorting into descending order by fields, since
      those sort commands do not have a feature for doing that.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>For example, if the buffer contains this:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
On systems where clash detection (locking of files being edited) is
implemented, Emacs also checks the first time you modify a buffer
whether the file has changed on disk since it was last visited or
saved.  If it has, you are asked to confirm that you want to change
the buffer.
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>applying <kbd>M-x sort-lines</kbd> to the entire buffer
  produces this:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
On systems where clash detection (locking of files being edited) is
implemented, Emacs also checks the first time you modify a buffer
saved.  If it has, you are asked to confirm that you want to change
the buffer.
whether the file has changed on disk since it was last visited or
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>where the upper-case &lsquo;<samp>O</samp>&rsquo; sorts before
  all lower-case letters. If you use <kbd>C-u 2 M-x
  sort-fields</kbd> instead, you get this:</p>

  <div class="smallexample">
    <pre class="smallexample">
implemented, Emacs also checks the first time you modify a buffer
saved.  If it has, you are asked to confirm that you want to change
the buffer.
On systems where clash detection (locking of files being edited) is
whether the file has changed on disk since it was last visited or
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>where the sort keys were &lsquo;<samp>Emacs</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>If</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>buffer</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>systems</samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp>the</samp>&rsquo;.</p><a name=
  "index-sort_002dcolumns" id="index-sort_002dcolumns"></a>

  <p><kbd>M-x sort-columns</kbd> requires more explanation. You
  specify the columns by putting point at one of the columns and
  the mark at the other column. Because this means you cannot put
  point or the mark at the beginning of the first line of the text
  you want to sort, this command uses an unusual definition of
  &ldquo;region&rdquo;: all of the line point is in is considered
  part of the region, and so is all of the line the mark is in, as
  well as all the lines in between.</p>

  <p>For example, to sort a table by information found in columns
  10 to 15, you could put the mark on column 10 in the first line
  of the table, and point on column 15 in the last line of the
  table, and then run <code>sort-columns</code>. Equivalently, you
  could run it with the mark on column 15 in the first line and
  point on column 10 in the last line.</p>

  <p>This can be thought of as sorting the rectangle specified by
  point and the mark, except that the text on each line to the left
  or right of the rectangle moves along with the text inside the
  rectangle. See <a href=
  "Rectangles.html#Rectangles">Rectangles</a>.</p><a name=
  "index-sort_002dfold_002dcase" id=
  "index-sort_002dfold_002dcase"></a>

  <p>Many of the sort commands ignore case differences when
  comparing, if <code>sort-fold-case</code> is
  non-<code>nil</code>.</p>
