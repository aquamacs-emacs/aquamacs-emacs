  <h3 class="section">54.2 When Is There a Bug</h3><a name=
  "index-bug-criteria" id="index-bug-criteria"></a> <a name=
  "index-what-constitutes-an-Emacs-bug" id=
  "index-what-constitutes-an-Emacs-bug"></a>

  <p>If Emacs accesses an invalid memory location (a.k.a.
  &ldquo;segmentation fault&rdquo;) or exits with an operating
  system error message that indicates a problem in the program (as
  opposed to something like &ldquo;disk full&rdquo;), then it is
  certainly a bug.</p>

  <p>If the Emacs display does not correspond properly to the
  contents of the buffer, then it is a bug. But you should check
  that features like buffer narrowing (see <a href=
  "Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>), which can hide parts
  of the buffer or change how it is displayed, are not
  responsible.</p>

  <p>Taking forever to complete a command can be a bug, but you
  must make sure that it is really Emacs&rsquo;s fault. Some
  commands simply take a long time. Type <kbd>C-g</kbd>
  (<kbd>C-<span class="key">Break</span></kbd> on MS-DOS) and then
  <kbd>C-h l</kbd> to see whether the input Emacs received was what
  you intended to type; if the input was such that you
  <em>know</em> it should have been processed quickly, report a
  bug. If you don&rsquo;t know whether the command should take a
  long time, find out by looking in the manual or by asking for
  assistance.</p>

  <p>If a command you are familiar with causes an Emacs error
  message in a case where its usual definition ought to be
  reasonable, it is probably a bug.</p>

  <p>If a command does the wrong thing, that is a bug. But be sure
  you know for certain what it ought to have done. If you
  aren&rsquo;t familiar with the command, it might actually be
  working right. If in doubt, read the command&rsquo;s
  documentation (see <a href="Name-Help.html#Name-Help">Name
  Help</a>).</p>

  <p>A command&rsquo;s intended definition may not be the best
  possible definition for editing with. This is a very important
  sort of problem, but it is also a matter of judgment. Also, it is
  easy to come to such a conclusion out of ignorance of some of the
  existing features. It is probably best not to complain about such
  a problem until you have checked the documentation in the usual
  ways, feel confident that you understand it, and know for certain
  that what you want is not available. Ask other Emacs users, too.
  If you are not sure what the command is supposed to do after a
  careful reading of the manual, check the index and glossary for
  any terms that may be unclear.</p>

  <p>If after careful rereading of the manual you still do not
  understand what the command should do, that indicates a bug in
  the manual, which you should report. The manual&rsquo;s job is to
  make everything clear to people who are not Emacs
  experts&mdash;including you. It is just as important to report
  documentation bugs as program bugs.</p>

  <p>If the built-in documentation for a function or variable
  disagrees with the manual, one of them must be wrong; that is a
  bug.</p>
