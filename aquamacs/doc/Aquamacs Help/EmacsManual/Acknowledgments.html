  <h2 class="unnumbered">Acknowledgments</h2>

  <p>Many people have contributed code included in the Free
  Software Foundation&rsquo;s distribution of GNU Emacs. To show
  our appreciation for their public spirit, we list here in
  alphabetical order those who have written substantial portions.
  Others too numerous to mention have reported and fixed bugs, and
  added features to many parts of Emacs. We thank them for their
  generosity as well.</p>

  <p>This list is intended to mention every contributor of a major
  package or feature we currently distribute; if you know of
  someone we have omitted, please make a bug report. More
  comprehensive information is available in the
