  Emacs</h3><a name="index-sending-patches-for-GNU-Emacs" id=

  <p>If you would like to write bug fixes or improvements for GNU
  Emacs, that is very helpful. When you send your changes, please
  follow these guidelines to make it easy for the maintainers to
  use them. If you don&rsquo;t follow these guidelines, your
  information might still be useful, but using it will take extra
  work. Maintaining GNU Emacs is a lot of work in the best of
  circumstances, and we can&rsquo;t keep up unless you do your best
  to help.</p>

  <p>Every patch must have several pieces of information before we
  can properly evaluate it.</p>

  <p>When you have all these pieces, bundle them up in a mail
  message and send it to the developers. Sending it to <a href=
  "mailto:bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org">bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org</a> (which
  is the bug/feature list) is recommended, because that list is
  coupled to a tracking system that makes it easier to locate
  patches. If your patch is not complete and you think it needs
  more discussion, you might want to send it to <a href=
  "mailto:emacs-devel@gnu.org">emacs-devel@gnu.org</a> instead. If
  you revise your patch, send it as a followup to the initial
  topic.</p>

  <p>We prefer to get the patches as plain text, either inline (be
  careful your mail client does not change line breaks) or as MIME
  attachments.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Include an explanation with your changes of what problem
    they fix or what improvement they bring about.

      <ul>
        <li>For a fix for an existing bug, it is best to reply to
        the relevant discussion on the
        &lsquo;<samp>bug-gnu-emacs</samp>&rsquo; list, or the bug
        entry in the GNU Bug Tracker at <a href=
        "http://debbugs.gnu.org">http://debbugs.gnu.org</a>.
        Explain why your change fixes the bug.</li>

        <li>For a new feature, include a description of the feature
        and your implementation.</li>

        <li>For a new bug, include a proper bug report for the
        problem you think you have fixed. We need to convince
        ourselves that the change is right before installing it.
        Even if it is correct, we might have trouble understanding
        it if we don&rsquo;t have a way to reproduce the
        problem.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Include all the comments that are appropriate to help
    people reading the source in the future understand why this
    change was needed.</li>

    <li>Don&rsquo;t mix together changes made for different
    reasons. Send them <em>individually</em>.

      <p>If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we
      might not want to install them both. We might want to install
      just one. If you send them all jumbled together in a single
      set of diffs, we have to do extra work to disentangle
      them&mdash;to figure out which parts of the change serve
      which purpose. If we don&rsquo;t have time for this, we might
      have to ignore your changes entirely.</p>

      <p>If you send each change as soon as you have written it,
      with its own explanation, then two changes never get tangled
      up, and we can consider each one properly without any extra
      work to disentangle them.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Send each change as soon as that change is finished.
    Sometimes people think they are helping us by accumulating many
    changes to send them all together. As explained above, this is
    absolutely the worst thing you could do.

      <p>Since you should send each change separately, you might as
      well send it right away. That gives us the option of
      installing it immediately if it is important.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The patch itself.

      <p>Use &lsquo;<samp>diff -u</samp>&rsquo; to make your diffs.
      Diffs without context are hard to install reliably. More than
      that, they are hard to study; we must always study a patch to
      decide whether we want to install it. Context format is
      better than contextless diffs, but we prefer the unified
      format.</p>

      <p>If you have GNU diff, use &lsquo;<samp>diff -u
      -F'^[_a-zA-Z0-9$]\+ *('</samp>&rsquo; when making diffs of C
      code. This shows the name of the function that each change
      occurs in.</p>

      <p>If you are using the Emacs repository, make sure your copy
      is up-to-date (e.g., with <code>git pull</code>). You can
      commit your changes to a private branch and generate a patch
      from the master version by using <code>git format-patch
      master</code>. Or you can leave your changes uncommitted and
      use <code>git diff</code>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Avoid any ambiguity as to which is the old version and
    which is the new. Please make the old version the first
    argument to diff, and the new version the second argument. And
    please give one version or the other a name that indicates
    whether it is the old version or your new changed one.</li>

    <li>Write the change log entries for your changes. This is both
    to save us the extra work of writing them, and to help explain
    your changes so we can understand them.

      <p>The purpose of the change log is to show people where to
      find what was changed. So you need to be specific about what
      functions you changed; in large functions, it&rsquo;s often
      helpful to indicate where within the function the change
      was.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, once you have shown people where to
      find the change, you need not explain its purpose in the
      change log. Thus, if you add a new function, all you need to
      say about it is that it is new. If you feel that the purpose
      needs explaining, it probably does&mdash;but put the
      explanation in comments in the code. It will be more useful
      there.</p>

      <p>Please look at the change log entries of recent commits to
      see what sorts of information to put in, and to learn the
      style that we use. Note that, unlike some other projects, we
      do require change logs for documentation, i.e., Texinfo
      files. See <a href="Change-Log.html#Change-Log">Change
      Log</a>, See <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Log-Concepts.html#Change-Log-Concepts">
      Change Log Concepts</a> in <cite>GNU Coding
      Standards</cite>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>When you write the fix, keep in mind that we can&rsquo;t
    install a change that would break other systems. Please think
    about what effect your change will have if compiled on another
    type of system.

      <p>Sometimes people send fixes that <em>might</em> be an
      improvement in general&mdash;but it is hard to be sure of
      this. It&rsquo;s hard to install such changes because we have
      to study them very carefully. Of course, a good explanation
      of the reasoning by which you concluded the change was
      correct can help convince us.</p>

      <p>The safest changes are changes to the configuration files
      for a particular machine. These are safe because they
      can&rsquo;t create new bugs on other machines.</p>

      <p>Please help us keep up with the workload by designing the
      patch in a form that is clearly safe to install.</p>
    </li>
