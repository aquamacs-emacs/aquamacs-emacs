  "index-files_002c-visiting-and-saving"></a> <a name=
  "index-saving-files" id="index-saving-files"></a>

  <p><em>Visiting</em> a file means reading its contents into an
  Emacs buffer so you can edit them. Emacs makes a new buffer for
  each file that you visit.</p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002df" id=
  "index-C_002dx-C_002df"></a> <a name="index-find_002dfile" id=
  "index-find_002dfile"></a>

  <p>To visit a file, type <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>
  (<code>find-file</code>) and use the minibuffer to enter the name
  of the desired file. While in the minibuffer, you can abort the
  command by typing <kbd>C-g</kbd>. See <a href=
  "File-Names.html#File-Names">File Names</a>, for details about
  entering file names into minibuffers.</p>

  <p>If the specified file exists but the system does not allow you
  to read it, an error message is displayed in the echo area.
  Otherwise, you can tell that <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> has completed
  successfully by the appearance of new text on the screen, and by
  the buffer name shown in the mode line (see <a href=
  "Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>). Emacs normally
  constructs the buffer name from the file name, omitting the
  directory name. For example, a file named
  <samp>/usr/rms/emacs.tex</samp> is visited in a buffer named
  &lsquo;<samp>emacs.tex</samp>&rsquo;. If there is already a
  buffer with that name, Emacs constructs a unique name; the normal
  method is to add a suffix based on the directory name (e.g.,
  &lsquo;<samp>&lt;rms&gt;</samp>&rsquo;,
  &lsquo;<samp>&lt;tmp&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, and so on), but you can
  select other methods. See <a href=
  "Uniquify.html#Uniquify">Uniquify</a>.</p><a name=
  "index-creating-files" id="index-creating-files"></a>

  <p>To create a new file, just visit it using the same command,
  <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>. Emacs displays &lsquo;<samp>(New
  file)</samp>&rsquo; in the echo area, but in other respects
  behaves as if you had visited an existing empty file.</p><a name=
  "index-modified-_0028buffer_0029" id=
  "index-modified-_0028buffer_0029"></a>

  <p>After visiting a file, the changes you make with editing
  commands are made in the Emacs buffer. They do not take effect in
  the visited file, until you <em>save</em> the buffer (see
  <a href="Saving.html#Saving">Saving</a>). If a buffer contains
  changes that have not been saved, we say the buffer is
  <em>modified</em>. This implies that some changes will be lost if
  the buffer is not saved. The mode line displays two stars near
  the left margin to indicate that the buffer is modified.</p>

  <p>If you visit a file that is already in Emacs, <kbd>C-x
  C-f</kbd> switches to the existing buffer instead of making
  another copy. Before doing so, it checks whether the file has
  changed since you last visited or saved it. If the file has
  changed, Emacs offers to reread it.</p><a name=
  "index-large_002dfile_002dwarning_002dthreshold" id=
  "index-large_002dfile_002dwarning_002dthreshold"></a> <a name=
  "index-file_002c-warning-when-size-is-large" id=
  "index-file_002c-warning-when-size-is-large"></a> <a name=
  "index-size-of-file_002c-warning-when-visiting" id=
  "index-size-of-file_002c-warning-when-visiting"></a> <a name=
  "index-maximum-buffer-size-exceeded_002c-error-message" id=
  "index-maximum-buffer-size-exceeded_002c-error-message"></a>

  <p>If you try to visit a file larger than
  <code>large-file-warning-threshold</code> (the default is
  10000000, which is about 10 megabytes), Emacs asks you for
  confirmation first. You can answer <kbd>y</kbd> to proceed with
  visiting the file. Note, however, that Emacs cannot visit files
  that are larger than the maximum Emacs buffer size, which is
  limited by the amount of memory Emacs can allocate and by the
  integers that Emacs can represent (see <a href=
  "Buffers.html#Buffers">Buffers</a>). If you try, Emacs displays
  an error message saying that the maximum buffer size has been
  exceeded.</p><a name="index-wildcard-characters-in-file-names"
  id="index-wildcard-characters-in-file-names"></a> <a name=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dwildcards" id=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dwildcards"></a>

  <p>If the file name you specify contains shell-style wildcard
  characters, Emacs visits all the files that match it. (On
  case-insensitive filesystems, Emacs matches the wildcards
  disregarding the letter case.) Wildcards include
  &lsquo;<samp>?</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo;, and
  &lsquo;<samp>[&hellip;]</samp>&rsquo; sequences. To enter the
  wild card &lsquo;<samp>?</samp>&rsquo; in a file name in the
  minibuffer, you need to type <kbd>C-q ?</kbd>. See <a href=
  "Quoted-File-Names.html#Quoted-File-Names">Quoted File Names</a>,
  for information on how to visit a file whose name actually
  contains wildcard characters. You can disable the wildcard
  feature by customizing
  <code>find-file-wildcards</code>.</p><a name=
  "index-C_002dx-C_002dv" id="index-C_002dx-C_002dv"></a> <a name=
  "index-find_002dalternate_002dfile" id=
  "index-find_002dalternate_002dfile"></a>

  <p>If you visit the wrong file unintentionally by typing its name
  incorrectly, type <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd>
  (<code>find-alternate-file</code>) to visit the file you really
  wanted. <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> is similar to <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, but
  it kills the current buffer (after first offering to save it if
  it is modified). When <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> reads the file name to
  visit, it inserts the entire default file name in the buffer,
  with point just after the directory part; this is convenient if
  you made a slight error in typing the name.</p><a name=
  "index-find_002dfile_002drun_002ddired" id=
  "index-find_002dfile_002drun_002ddired"></a>

  <p>If you visit a file that is actually a directory, Emacs
  invokes Dired, the Emacs directory browser. See <a href=
  "Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>. You can disable this behavior by
  setting the variable <code>find-file-run-dired</code> to
  <code>nil</code>; in that case, it is an error to try to visit a
  directory.</p>

  <p>Files which are actually collections of other files, or
  <em>file archives</em>, are visited in special modes which invoke
  a Dired-like environment to allow operations on archive members.
  See <a href="File-Archives.html#File-Archives">File Archives</a>,
  for more about these features.</p>

  <p>If you visit a file that the operating system won&rsquo;t let
  you modify, or that is marked read-only, Emacs makes the buffer
  read-only too, so that you won&rsquo;t go ahead and make changes
  that you&rsquo;ll have trouble saving afterward. You can make the
  buffer writable with <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd>
  (<code>read-only-mode</code>). See <a href=
  "Misc-Buffer.html#Misc-Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>.</p><a name=
  "index-C_002dx-C_002dr" id="index-C_002dx-C_002dr"></a> <a name=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dread_002donly" id=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dread_002donly"></a>

  <p>If you want to visit a file as read-only in order to protect
  yourself from entering changes accidentally, visit it with the
  command <kbd>C-x C-r</kbd> (<code>find-file-read-only</code>)
  instead of <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.</p><a name="index-C_002dx-4-f" id=
  "index-C_002dx-4-f"></a> <a name=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dother_002dwindow" id=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dother_002dwindow"></a>

  <p><kbd>C-x 4 f</kbd> (<code>find-file-other-window</code>) is
  like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> except that the buffer containing the
  specified file is selected in another window. The window that was
  selected before <kbd>C-x 4 f</kbd> continues to show the same
  buffer it was already showing. If this command is used when only
  one window is being displayed, that window is split in two, with
  one window showing the same buffer as before, and the other one
  showing the newly requested file. See <a href=
  "Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>.</p><a name=
  "index-C_002dx-5-f" id="index-C_002dx-5-f"></a> <a name=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dother_002dframe" id=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dother_002dframe"></a>

  <p><kbd>C-x 5 f</kbd> (<code>find-file-other-frame</code>) is
  similar, but opens a new frame, or selects any existing frame
  showing the specified file. See <a href=
  "Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>.</p><a name=
  "index-file-selection-dialog" id=
  "index-file-selection-dialog"></a>

  <p>On graphical displays, there are two additional methods for
  visiting files. Firstly, when Emacs is built with a suitable GUI
  toolkit, commands invoked with the mouse (by clicking on the menu
  bar or tool bar) use the toolkit&rsquo;s standard file selection
  dialog instead of prompting for the file name in the minibuffer.
  On GNU/Linux and Unix platforms, Emacs does this when built with
  GTK, LessTif, and Motif toolkits; on MS-Windows and Mac, the GUI
  version does that by default. For information on how to customize
  this, see <a href="Dialog-Boxes.html#Dialog-Boxes">Dialog
  Boxes</a>.</p>

  <p>Secondly, Emacs supports drag and drop: dropping a file into
  an ordinary Emacs window visits the file using that window. As an
  exception, dropping a file into a window displaying a Dired
  buffer moves or copies the file into the displayed directory. For
  details, see <a href="Drag-and-Drop.html#Drag-and-Drop">Drag and
  Drop</a>, and <a href=
  "Misc-Dired-Features.html#Misc-Dired-Features">Misc Dired
  Features</a>.</p>

  <p>On text-mode terminals and on graphical displays when Emacs
  was built without a GUI toolkit, you can visit files via the
  menu-bar &lsquo;<samp>File</samp>&rsquo; menu, which has a
  &lsquo;<samp>Visit New File</samp>&rsquo; item.</p>

  <p>Each time you visit a file, Emacs automatically scans its
  contents to detect what character encoding and end-of-line
  convention it uses, and converts these to Emacs&rsquo;s internal
  encoding and end-of-line convention within the buffer. When you
  save the buffer, Emacs performs the inverse conversion, writing
  the file to disk with its original encoding and end-of-line
  convention. See <a href=
  "Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding
  Systems</a>.</p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dliterally" id=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dliterally"></a>

  <p>If you wish to edit a file as a sequence of
  <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters with no special encoding or
  conversion, use the <kbd>M-x find-file-literally</kbd> command.
  This visits a file, like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, but does not do
  format conversion (see <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Format-Conversion.html#Format-Conversion">
  Format Conversion</a> in <cite>the Emacs Lisp Reference
  Manual</cite>), character code conversion (see <a href=
  "Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>), or
  automatic uncompression (see <a href=
  "Compressed-Files.html#Compressed-Files">Compressed Files</a>),
  and does not add a final newline because of
  <code>require-final-newline</code> (see <a href=
  "Customize-Save.html#Customize-Save">Customize Save</a>). If you
  have already visited the same file in the usual (non-literal)
  manner, this command asks you whether to visit it literally
  instead.</p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dhook" id=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dhook"></a> <a name=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dnot_002dfound_002dfunctions" id=
  "index-find_002dfile_002dnot_002dfound_002dfunctions"></a>

  <p>Two special hook variables allow extensions to modify the
  operation of visiting files. Visiting a file that does not exist
  runs the functions in <code>find-file-not-found-functions</code>;
  this variable holds a list of functions, which are called one by
  one (with no arguments) until one of them returns
  non-<code>nil</code>. This is not a normal hook, and the name
  ends in &lsquo;<samp>-functions</samp>&rsquo; rather than
  &lsquo;<samp>-hook</samp>&rsquo; to indicate that fact.</p>

  <p>Successful visiting of any file, whether existing or not,
  calls the functions in <code>find-file-hook</code>, with no
  arguments. This variable is a normal hook. In the case of a
  nonexistent file, the <code>find-file-not-found-functions</code>
  are run first. See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.</p>

  <p>There are several ways to specify automatically the major mode
  for editing the file (see <a href=
  "Choosing-Modes.html#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>), and to
  specify local variables defined for that file (see <a href=
  "File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).</p>
