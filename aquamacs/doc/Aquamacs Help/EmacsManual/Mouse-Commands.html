    <dd>
      <p>If the region is active, move the nearer end of the region
      to the click position; otherwise, set mark at the current
      value of point and point at the click position. Save the
      resulting region in the kill ring; on a second click, kill it
      (<code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>).</p>
    </dd>
  </dl><a name="index-mouse_002dset_002dpoint" id=
  "index-mouse_002dset_002dpoint"></a>

  <p>The most basic mouse command is <code>mouse-set-point</code>,
  which is invoked by clicking with the left mouse button,
  <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>, in the text area of a window. This moves
  point to the position where you clicked. If that window was not
  the selected window, it becomes the selected window.</p><a name=
  "index-x_002dmouse_002dclick_002dfocus_002dignore_002dposition"
  id=
  "index-x_002dmouse_002dclick_002dfocus_002dignore_002dposition"></a>

  <p>Normally, if the frame you clicked in was not the selected
  frame, it is made the selected frame, in addition to selecting
  the window and setting the cursor. On the X Window System, you
  can change this by setting the variable
  <code>x-mouse-click-focus-ignore-position</code> to
  <code>t</code>. In that case, the initial click on an unselected
  frame just selects the frame, without doing anything else;
  clicking again selects the window and sets the cursor
  position.</p><a name="index-mouse_002c-dragging" id=
  "index-mouse_002c-dragging"></a> <a name=
  "index-mouse_002dset_002dregion" id=
  "index-mouse_002dset_002dregion"></a>

  <p>Holding down <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> and dragging the mouse over a
  stretch of text activates the region around that text
  (<code>mouse-set-region</code>), placing the mark where you
  started holding down the mouse button, and point where you
  release it (see <a href="Mark.html#Mark">Mark</a>). In addition,
  the text in the region becomes the primary selection (see
  <a href="Primary-Selection.html#Primary-Selection">Primary
  Selection</a>).</p><a name=
  "index-mouse_002ddrag_002dcopy_002dregion" id=
  "index-mouse_002ddrag_002dcopy_002dregion"></a>

  <p>If you change the variable <code>mouse-drag-copy-region</code>
  to a non-<code>nil</code> value, dragging the mouse over a
  stretch of text also adds the text to the kill ring. The default
  is <code>nil</code>.</p><a name=
  "index-mouse_002dscroll_002dmin_002dlines" id=
  "index-mouse_002dscroll_002dmin_002dlines"></a>

  <p>If you move the mouse off the top or bottom of the window
  while dragging, the window scrolls at a steady rate until you
  move the mouse back into the window. This way, you can select
  regions that don&rsquo;t fit entirely on the screen. The number
  of lines scrolled per step depends on how far away from the
  window edge the mouse has gone; the variable
  <code>mouse-scroll-min-lines</code> specifies a minimum step
  size.</p><a name="index-mouse_002dyank_002dprimary" id=
  "index-mouse_002dyank_002dprimary"></a> <a name=
  "index-mouse_002dyank_002dat_002dclick" id=
  "index-mouse_002dyank_002dat_002dclick"></a>

  <p>Clicking with the middle mouse button, <kbd>mouse-2</kbd>,
  moves point to the position where you clicked and inserts the
  contents of the primary selection
  (<code>mouse-yank-primary</code>). See <a href=
  "Primary-Selection.html#Primary-Selection">Primary Selection</a>.
  This behavior is consistent with other X applications.
  Alternatively, you can rebind <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> to
  <code>mouse-yank-at-click</code>, which performs a yank at the
  position you click.</p><a name=
  "index-mouse_002dyank_002dat_002dpoint" id=
  "index-mouse_002dyank_002dat_002dpoint"></a>

  <p>If you change the variable <code>mouse-yank-at-point</code> to
  a non-<code>nil</code> value, <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> does not move
  point; it inserts the text at point, regardless of where you
  clicked or even which of the frame&rsquo;s windows you clicked
  on. This variable affects both <code>mouse-yank-primary</code>
  and <code>mouse-yank-at-click</code>.</p><a name=
  "index-mouse_002dsave_002dthen_002dkill" id=
  "index-mouse_002dsave_002dthen_002dkill"></a>

  <p>Clicking with the right mouse button, <kbd>mouse-3</kbd>, runs
  the command <code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>. This performs
  several actions depending on where you click and the status of
  the region:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If no region is active, clicking <kbd>mouse-3</kbd>
    activates the region, placing the mark where point was and
    point at the clicked position.</li>

    <li>If a region is active, clicking <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> adjusts
    the nearer end of the region by moving it to the clicked
    position. The adjusted region&rsquo;s text is copied to the
    kill ring; if the text in the original region was already on
    the kill ring, it replaces it there.</li>

    <li>If you originally specified the region using a double or
    triple <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>, so that the region is defined to
    consist of entire words or lines (see <a href=
    "Word-and-Line-Mouse.html#Word-and-Line-Mouse">Word and Line
    Mouse</a>), then adjusting the region with <kbd>mouse-3</kbd>
    also proceeds by entire words or lines.</li>

    <li>If you use <kbd>mouse-3</kbd> a second time consecutively,
    at the same place, that kills the region already selected.
    Thus, the simplest way to kill text with the mouse is to click
    <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> at one end, then click <kbd>mouse-3</kbd>
    twice at the other end. To copy the text into the kill ring
    without deleting it from the buffer, press <kbd>mouse-3</kbd>
    just once&mdash;or just drag across the text with
    <kbd>mouse-1</kbd>. Then you can copy it elsewhere by yanking
    it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <code>mouse-save-then-kill</code> command also obeys the
  variable <code>mouse-drag-copy-region</code> (described above).
  If the value is non-<code>nil</code>, then whenever the command
  sets or adjusts the active region, the text in the region is also
  added to the kill ring. If the latest kill ring entry had been
  added the same way, that entry is replaced rather than making a
  new entry.</p>

  <p>Whenever you set the region using any of the mouse commands
  described above, the mark will be deactivated by any subsequent
  unshifted cursor motion command, in addition to the usual ways of
  deactivating the mark. See <a href=
  "Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift
  Selection</a>.</p><a name="index-mouse-wheel" id=

  <p>Some mice have a &ldquo;wheel&rdquo; which can be used for
  scrolling. Emacs supports scrolling windows with the mouse wheel,
  by default, on most graphical displays. To toggle this feature,
  use <kbd>M-x mouse-wheel-mode</kbd>. The variables
  <code>mouse-wheel-follow-mouse</code> and
  <code>mouse-wheel-scroll-amount</code> determine where and by how
  much buffers are scrolled. The variable
  <code>mouse-wheel-progressive-speed</code> determines whether the
  scroll speed is linked to how fast you move the wheel.</p>
