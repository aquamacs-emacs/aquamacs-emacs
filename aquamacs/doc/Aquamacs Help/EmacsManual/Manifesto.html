  <h2 class="unnumbered">The GNU Manifesto</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The GNU Manifesto which appears below was written by Richard
    Stallman at the beginning of the GNU project, to ask for
    participation and support. For the first few years, it was
    updated in minor ways to account for developments, but now it
    seems best to leave it unchanged as most people have seen
    it.</p>

    <p>Since that time, we have learned about certain common
    misunderstandings that different wording could help avoid.
    Footnotes added in 1993 help clarify these points.</p>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">What&rsquo;s GNU? Gnu&rsquo;s Not
  Unix!</h3>

  <p>GNU, which stands for Gnu&rsquo;s Not Unix, is the name for
  the complete Unix-compatible software system which I am writing
  so that I can give it away free to everyone who can use
  it.<a name="DOCF28" href="#FOOT28" id="DOCF28"><sup>28</sup></a>
  Several other volunteers are helping me. Contributions of time,
  money, programs and equipment are greatly needed.</p>

  <p>So far we have an Emacs text editor with Lisp for writing
  editor commands, a source level debugger, a yacc-compatible
  parser generator, a linker, and around 35 utilities. A shell
  (command interpreter) is nearly completed. A new portable
  optimizing C compiler has compiled itself and may be released
  this year. An initial kernel exists but many more features are
  needed to emulate Unix. When the kernel and compiler are
  finished, it will be possible to distribute a GNU system suitable
  for program development. We will use TeX as our text formatter,
  but an nroff is being worked on. We will use the free, portable X
  window system as well. After this we will add a portable Common
  Lisp, an Empire game, a spreadsheet, and hundreds of other
  things, plus on-line documentation. We hope to supply,
  eventually, everything useful that normally comes with a Unix
  system, and more.</p>

  <p>GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be
  identical to Unix. We will make all improvements that are
  convenient, based on our experience with other operating systems.
  In particular, we plan to have longer file names, file version
  numbers, a crashproof file system, file name completion perhaps,
  terminal-independent display support, and perhaps eventually a
  Lisp-based window system through which several Lisp programs and
  ordinary Unix programs can share a screen. Both C and Lisp will
  be available as system programming languages. We will try to
  support UUCP, MIT Chaosnet, and Internet protocols for
  communication.</p>

  <p>GNU is aimed initially at machines in the 68000/16000 class
  with virtual memory, because they are the easiest machines to
  make it run on. The extra effort to make it run on smaller
  machines will be left to someone who wants to use it on them.</p>

  <p>To avoid horrible confusion, please pronounce the
  &ldquo;G&rdquo; in the word &ldquo;GNU&rdquo; when it is the name
  of this project.</p><a name="Why-I-Must-Write-GNU" id=
  "Why-I-Must-Write-GNU"></a>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why I Must Write GNU</h3>

  <p>I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a
  program I must share it with other people who like it. Software
  sellers want to divide the users and conquer them, making each
  user agree not to share with others. I refuse to break solidarity
  with other users in this way. I cannot in good conscience sign a
  nondisclosure agreement or a software license agreement. For
  years I worked within the Artificial Intelligence Lab to resist
  such tendencies and other inhospitalities, but eventually they
  had gone too far: I could not remain in an institution where such
  things are done for me against my will.</p>

  <p>So that I can continue to use computers without dishonor, I
  have decided to put together a sufficient body of free software
  so that I will be able to get along without any software that is
  not free. I have resigned from the AI lab to deny MIT any legal
  excuse to prevent me from giving GNU away.</p><a name=
  "Why-GNU-Will-Be-Compatible-with-Unix" id=
  "Why-GNU-Will-Be-Compatible-with-Unix"></a>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why GNU Will Be Compatible with
  Unix</h3>

  <p>Unix is not my ideal system, but it is not too bad. The
  essential features of Unix seem to be good ones, and I think I
  can fill in what Unix lacks without spoiling them. And a system
  compatible with Unix would be convenient for many other people to
  adopt.</p><a name="How-GNU-Will-Be-Available" id=
  "How-GNU-Will-Be-Available"></a>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">How GNU Will Be Available</h3>

  <p>GNU is not in the public domain. Everyone will be permitted to
  modify and redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed
  to restrict its further redistribution. That is to say,
  proprietary modifications will not be allowed. I want to make
  sure that all versions of GNU remain free.</p><a name=
  "Why-Many-Other-Programmers-Want-to-Help" id=
  "Why-Many-Other-Programmers-Want-to-Help"></a>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why Many Other Programmers Want to
  Help</h3>

  <p>I have found many other programmers who are excited about GNU
  and want to help.</p>

  <p>Many programmers are unhappy about the commercialization of
  system software. It may enable them to make more money, but it
  requires them to feel in conflict with other programmers in
  general rather than feel as comrades. The fundamental act of
  friendship among programmers is the sharing of programs;
  marketing arrangements now typically used essentially forbid
  programmers to treat others as friends. The purchaser of software
  must choose between friendship and obeying the law. Naturally,
  many decide that friendship is more important. But those who
  believe in law often do not feel at ease with either choice. They
  become cynical and think that programming is just a way of making
  money.</p>

  <p>By working on and using GNU rather than proprietary programs,
  we can be hospitable to everyone and obey the law. In addition,
  GNU serves as an example to inspire and a banner to rally others
  to join us in sharing. This can give us a feeling of harmony
  which is impossible if we use software that is not free. For
  about half the programmers I talk to, this is an important
  happiness that money cannot replace.</p><a name=
  "How-You-Can-Contribute" id="How-You-Can-Contribute"></a>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">How You Can Contribute</h3>

  <p>I am asking computer manufacturers for donations of machines
  and money. I&rsquo;m asking individuals for donations of programs
  and work.</p>

  <p>One consequence you can expect if you donate machines is that
  GNU will run on them at an early date. The machines should be
  complete, ready to use systems, approved for use in a residential
  area, and not in need of sophisticated cooling or power.</p>

  <p>I have found very many programmers eager to contribute
  part-time work for GNU. For most projects, such part-time
  distributed work would be very hard to coordinate; the
  independently-written parts would not work together. But for the
  particular task of replacing Unix, this problem is absent. A
  complete Unix system contains hundreds of utility programs, each
  of which is documented separately. Most interface specifications
  are fixed by Unix compatibility. If each contributor can write a
  compatible replacement for a single Unix utility, and make it
  work properly in place of the original on a Unix system, then
  these utilities will work right when put together. Even allowing
  for Murphy to create a few unexpected problems, assembling these
  components will be a feasible task. (The kernel will require
  closer communication and will be worked on by a small, tight
  group.)</p>

  <p>If I get donations of money, I may be able to hire a few
  people full or part time. The salary won&rsquo;t be high by
  programmers&rsquo; standards, but I&rsquo;m looking for people
  for whom building community spirit is as important as making
  money. I view this as a way of enabling dedicated people to
  devote their full energies to working on GNU by sparing them the
  need to make a living in another way.</p><a name=
  "Why-All-Computer-Users-Will-Benefit" id=
  "Why-All-Computer-Users-Will-Benefit"></a>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why All Computer Users Will
  Benefit</h3>

  <p>Once GNU is written, everyone will be able to obtain good
  system software free, just like air.<a name="DOCF29" href=
  "#FOOT29" id="DOCF29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

  <p>This means much more than just saving everyone the price of a
  Unix license. It means that much wasteful duplication of system
  programming effort will be avoided. This effort can go instead
  into advancing the state of the art.</p>

  <p>Complete system sources will be available to everyone. As a
  result, a user who needs changes in the system will always be
  free to make them himself, or hire any available programmer or
  company to make them for him. Users will no longer be at the
  mercy of one programmer or company which owns the sources and is
  in sole position to make changes.</p>

  <p>Schools will be able to provide a much more educational
  environment by encouraging all students to study and improve the
  system code. Harvard&rsquo;s computer lab used to have the policy
  that no program could be installed on the system if its sources
  were not on public display, and upheld it by actually refusing to
  install certain programs. I was very much inspired by this.</p>

  <p>Finally, the overhead of considering who owns the system
  software and what one is or is not entitled to do with it will be
  lifted.</p>

  <p>Arrangements to make people pay for using a program, including
  licensing of copies, always incur a tremendous cost to society
  through the cumbersome mechanisms necessary to figure out how
  much (that is, which programs) a person must pay for. And only a
  police state can force everyone to obey them. Consider a space
  station where air must be manufactured at great cost: charging
  each breather per liter of air may be fair, but wearing the
  metered gas mask all day and all night is intolerable even if
  everyone can afford to pay the air bill. And the TV cameras
  everywhere to see if you ever take the mask off are outrageous.
  It&rsquo;s better to support the air plant with a head tax and
  chuck the masks.</p>

  <p>Copying all or parts of a program is as natural to a
  programmer as breathing, and as productive. It ought to be as
  free.</p><a name=

  "Some-Easily-Rebutted-Objections-to-GNU_0027s-Goals"></a>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Some Easily Rebutted Objections to
  GNU&rsquo;s Goals</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Nobody will use it if it is free, because that means
    they can&rsquo;t rely on any support.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You have to charge for the program to pay for
    providing the support.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>If people would rather pay for GNU plus service than get GNU
  free without service, a company to provide just service to people
  who have obtained GNU free ought to be profitable.<a name=
  "DOCF30" href="#FOOT30" id="DOCF30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

  <p>We must distinguish between support in the form of real
  programming work and mere handholding. The former is something
  one cannot rely on from a software vendor. If your problem is not
  shared by enough people, the vendor will tell you to get
  lost.</p>

  <p>If your business needs to be able to rely on support, the only
  way is to have all the necessary sources and tools. Then you can
  hire any available person to fix your problem; you are not at the
  mercy of any individual. With Unix, the price of sources puts
  this out of consideration for most businesses. With GNU this will
  be easy. It is still possible for there to be no available
  competent person, but this problem cannot be blamed on
  distribution arrangements. GNU does not eliminate all the
  world&rsquo;s problems, only some of them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the users who know nothing about computers need
  handholding: doing things for them which they could easily do
  themselves but don&rsquo;t know how.</p>

  <p>Such services could be provided by companies that sell just
  hand-holding and repair service. If it is true that users would
  rather spend money and get a product with service, they will also
  be willing to buy the service having got the product free. The
  service companies will compete in quality and price; users will
  not be tied to any particular one. Meanwhile, those of us who
  don&rsquo;t need the service should be able to use the program
  without paying for the service.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;You cannot reach many people without advertising, and
    you must charge for the program to support that.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use advertising a program people can
    get free.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There are various forms of free or very cheap publicity that
  can be used to inform numbers of computer users about something
  like GNU. But it may be true that one can reach more
  microcomputer users with advertising. If this is really so, a
  business which advertises the service of copying and mailing GNU
  for a fee ought to be successful enough to pay for its
  advertising and more. This way, only the users who benefit from
  the advertising pay for it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if many people get GNU from their friends,
  and such companies don&rsquo;t succeed, this will show that
  advertising was not really necessary to spread GNU. Why is it
  that free market advocates don&rsquo;t want to let the free
  market decide this?<a name="DOCF31" href="#FOOT31" id=
  "DOCF31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;My company needs a proprietary operating system to
    get a competitive edge.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>GNU will remove operating system software from the realm of
  competition. You will not be able to get an edge in this area,
  but neither will your competitors be able to get an edge over
  you. You and they will compete in other areas, while benefiting
  mutually in this one. If your business is selling an operating
  system, you will not like GNU, but that&rsquo;s tough on you. If
  your business is something else, GNU can save you from being
  pushed into the expensive business of selling operating
  systems.</p>

  <p>I would like to see GNU development supported by gifts from
  many manufacturers and users, reducing the cost to each.<a name=
  "DOCF32" href="#FOOT32" id="DOCF32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t programmers deserve a reward for their
    creativity?&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>If anything deserves a reward, it is social contribution.
  Creativity can be a social contribution, but only in so far as
  society is free to use the results. If programmers deserve to be
  rewarded for creating innovative programs, by the same token they
  deserve to be punished if they restrict the use of these
  programs.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t a programmer be able to ask for a
    reward for his creativity?&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There is nothing wrong with wanting pay for work, or seeking
  to maximize one&rsquo;s income, as long as one does not use means
  that are destructive. But the means customary in the field of
  software today are based on destruction.</p>

  <p>Extracting money from users of a program by restricting their
  use of it is destructive because the restrictions reduce the
  amount and the ways that the program can be used. This reduces
  the amount of wealth that humanity derives from the program. When
  there is a deliberate choice to restrict, the harmful
  consequences are deliberate destruction.</p>

  <p>The reason a good citizen does not use such destructive means
  to become wealthier is that, if everyone did so, we would all
  become poorer from the mutual destructiveness. This is Kantian
  ethics; or, the Golden Rule. Since I do not like the consequences
  that result if everyone hoards information, I am required to
  consider it wrong for one to do so. Specifically, the desire to
  be rewarded for one&rsquo;s creativity does not justify depriving
  the world in general of all or part of that creativity.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t programmers starve?&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I could answer that nobody is forced to be a programmer. Most
  of us cannot manage to get any money for standing on the street
  and making faces. But we are not, as a result, condemned to spend
  our lives standing on the street making faces, and starving. We
  do something else.</p>

  <p>But that is the wrong answer because it accepts the
  questioner&rsquo;s implicit assumption: that without ownership of
  software, programmers cannot possibly be paid a cent. Supposedly
  it is all or nothing.</p>

  <p>The real reason programmers will not starve is that it will
  still be possible for them to get paid for programming; just not
  paid as much as now.</p>

  <p>Restricting copying is not the only basis for business in
  software. It is the most common basis because it brings in the
  most money. If it were prohibited, or rejected by the customer,
  software business would move to other bases of organization which
  are now used less often. There are always numerous ways to
  organize any kind of business.</p>

  <p>Probably programming will not be as lucrative on the new basis
  as it is now. But that is not an argument against the change. It
  is not considered an injustice that sales clerks make the
  salaries that they now do. If programmers made the same, that
  would not be an injustice either. (In practice they would still
  make considerably more than that.)</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t people have a right to control how their
    creativity is used?&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;Control over the use of one&rsquo;s ideas&rdquo; really
  constitutes control over other people&rsquo;s lives; and it is
  usually used to make their lives more difficult.</p>

  <p>People who have studied the issue of intellectual property
  rights<a name="DOCF33" href="#FOOT33" id=
  "DOCF33"><sup>33</sup></a> carefully (such as lawyers) say that
  there is no intrinsic right to intellectual property. The kinds
  of supposed intellectual property rights that the government
  recognizes were created by specific acts of legislation for
  specific purposes.</p>

  <p>For example, the patent system was established to encourage
  inventors to disclose the details of their inventions. Its
  purpose was to help society rather than to help inventors. At the
  time, the life span of 17 years for a patent was short compared
  with the rate of advance of the state of the art. Since patents
  are an issue only among manufacturers, for whom the cost and
  effort of a license agreement are small compared with setting up
  production, the patents often do not do much harm. They do not
  obstruct most individuals who use patented products.</p>

  <p>The idea of copyright did not exist in ancient times, when
  authors frequently copied other authors at length in works of
  non-fiction. This practice was useful, and is the only way many
  authors&rsquo; works have survived even in part. The copyright
  system was created expressly for the purpose of encouraging
  authorship. In the domain for which it was invented&mdash;books,
  which could be copied economically only on a printing
  press&mdash;it did little harm, and did not obstruct most of the
  individuals who read the books.</p>

  <p>All intellectual property rights are just licenses granted by
  society because it was thought, rightly or wrongly, that society
  as a whole would benefit by granting them. But in any particular
  situation, we have to ask: are we really better off granting such
  license? What kind of act are we licensing a person to do?</p>

  <p>The case of programs today is very different from that of
  books a hundred years ago. The fact that the easiest way to copy
  a program is from one neighbor to another, the fact that a
  program has both source code and object code which are distinct,
  and the fact that a program is used rather than read and enjoyed,
  combine to create a situation in which a person who enforces a
  copyright is harming society as a whole both materially and
  spiritually; in which a person should not do so regardless of
  whether the law enables him to.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Competition makes things get done better.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The paradigm of competition is a race: by rewarding the
  winner, we encourage everyone to run faster. When capitalism
  really works this way, it does a good job; but its defenders are
  wrong in assuming it always works this way. If the runners forget
  why the reward is offered and become intent on winning, no matter
  how, they may find other strategies&mdash;such as, attacking
  other runners. If the runners get into a fist fight, they will
  all finish late.</p>

  <p>Proprietary and secret software is the moral equivalent of
  runners in a fist fight. Sad to say, the only referee we&rsquo;ve
  got does not seem to object to fights; he just regulates them
  (&ldquo;For every ten yards you run, you can fire one
  shot&rdquo;). He really ought to break them up, and penalize
  runners for even trying to fight.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t everyone stop programming without a
    monetary incentive?&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Actually, many people will program with absolutely no monetary
  incentive. Programming has an irresistible fascination for some
  people, usually the people who are best at it. There is no
  shortage of professional musicians who keep at it even though
  they have no hope of making a living that way.</p>

  <p>But really this question, though commonly asked, is not
  appropriate to the situation. Pay for programmers will not
  disappear, only become less. So the right question is, will
  anyone program with a reduced monetary incentive? My experience
  shows that they will.</p>

  <p>For more than ten years, many of the world&rsquo;s best
  programmers worked at the Artificial Intelligence Lab for far
  less money than they could have had anywhere else. They got many
  kinds of non-monetary rewards: fame and appreciation, for
  example. And creativity is also fun, a reward in itself.</p>

  <p>Then most of them left when offered a chance to do the same
  interesting work for a lot of money.</p>

  <p>What the facts show is that people will program for reasons
  other than riches; but if given a chance to make a lot of money
  as well, they will come to expect and demand it. Low-paying
  organizations do poorly in competition with high-paying ones, but
  they do not have to do badly if the high-paying ones are
  banned.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;We need the programmers desperately. If they demand
    that we stop helping our neighbors, we have to obey.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You&rsquo;re never so desperate that you have to obey this
  sort of demand. Remember: millions for defense, but not a cent
  for tribute!</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Programmers need to make a living somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the short run, this is true. However, there are plenty of
  ways that programmers could make a living without selling the
  right to use a program. This way is customary now because it
  brings programmers and businessmen the most money, not because it
  is the only way to make a living. It is easy to find other ways
  if you want to find them. Here are a number of examples.</p>

  <p>A manufacturer introducing a new computer will pay for the
  porting of operating systems onto the new hardware.</p>

  <p>The sale of teaching, hand-holding and maintenance services
  could also employ programmers.</p>

  <p>People with new ideas could distribute programs as
  freeware<a name="DOCF34" href="#FOOT34" id=
  "DOCF34"><sup>34</sup></a>, asking for donations from satisfied
  users, or selling hand-holding services. I have met people who
  are already working this way successfully.</p>

  <p>Users with related needs can form users&rsquo; groups, and pay
  dues. A group would contract with programming companies to write
  programs that the group&rsquo;s members would like to use.</p>

  <p>All sorts of development can be funded with a Software
  Tax:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Suppose everyone who buys a computer has to pay x percent of
    the price as a software tax. The government gives this to an
    agency like the NSF to spend on software development.</p>

    <p>But if the computer buyer makes a donation to software
    development himself, he can take a credit against the tax. He
    can donate to the project of his own choosing&mdash;often,
    chosen because he hopes to use the results when it is done. He
    can take a credit for any amount of donation up to the total
    tax he had to pay.</p>

    <p>The total tax rate could be decided by a vote of the payers
    of the tax, weighted according to the amount they will be taxed
    on.</p>

    <p>The consequences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The computer-using community supports software
      development.</li>

      <li>This community decides what level of support is
      needed.</li>

      <li>Users who care which projects their share is spent on can
      choose this for themselves.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the long run, making programs free is a step toward the
  post-scarcity world, where nobody will have to work very hard
  just to make a living. People will be free to devote themselves
  to activities that are fun, such as programming, after spending
  the necessary ten hours a week on required tasks such as
  legislation, family counseling, robot repair and asteroid
  prospecting. There will be no need to be able to make a living
  from programming.</p>

  <p>We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the
  whole society must do for its actual productivity, but only a
  little of this has translated itself into leisure for workers
  because much nonproductive activity is required to accompany
  productive activity. The main causes of this are bureaucracy and
  isometric struggles against competition. Free software will
  greatly reduce these drains in the area of software production.
  We must do this, in order for technical gains in productivity to
  translate into less work for us.</p>

    <h3><a name="FOOT28" href="#DOCF28" id="FOOT28">(28)</a></h3>

    <p>The wording here was careless. The intention was that nobody
    would have to pay for <em>permission</em> to use the GNU
    system. But the words don&rsquo;t make this clear, and people
    often interpret them as saying that copies of GNU should always
    be distributed at little or no charge. That was never the
    intent; later on, the manifesto mentions the possibility of
    companies providing the service of distribution for a profit.
    Subsequently I have learned to distinguish carefully between
    &ldquo;free&rdquo; in the sense of freedom and
    &ldquo;free&rdquo; in the sense of price. Free software is
    software that users have the freedom to distribute and change.
    Some users may obtain copies at no charge, while others pay to
    obtain copies&mdash;and if the funds help support improving the
    software, so much the better. The important thing is that
    everyone who has a copy has the freedom to cooperate with
    others in using it.</p>

    <h3><a name="FOOT29" href="#DOCF29" id="FOOT29">(29)</a></h3>

    <p>This is another place I failed to distinguish carefully
    between the two different meanings of &ldquo;free.&rdquo; The
    statement as it stands is not false&mdash;you can get copies of
    GNU software at no charge, from your friends or over the net.
    But it does suggest the wrong idea.</p>

    <h3><a name="FOOT30" href="#DOCF30" id="FOOT30">(30)</a></h3>

    <p>Several such companies now exist.</p>

    <h3><a name="FOOT31" href="#DOCF31" id="FOOT31">(31)</a></h3>

    <p>The Free Software Foundation raises most of its funds from a
    distribution service, although it is a charity rather than a
    company. If <em>no one</em> chooses to obtain copies by
    ordering from the FSF, it will be unable to do its work. But
    this does not mean that proprietary restrictions are justified
    to force every user to pay. If a small fraction of all the
    users order copies from the FSF, that is sufficient to keep the
    FSF afloat. So we ask users to choose to support us in this
    way. Have you done your part?</p>

    <h3><a name="FOOT32" href="#DOCF32" id="FOOT32">(32)</a></h3>

    <p>A group of computer companies recently pooled funds to
    support maintenance of the GNU C Compiler.</p>

    <h3><a name="FOOT33" href="#DOCF33" id="FOOT33">(33)</a></h3>

    <p>In the 80s I had not yet realized how confusing it was to
    speak of &ldquo;the issue&rdquo; of &ldquo;intellectual
    property.&rdquo; That term is obviously biased; more subtle is
    the fact that it lumps together various disparate laws which
    raise very different issues. Nowadays I urge people to reject
    the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; entirely, lest it
    lead others to suppose that those laws form one coherent issue.
    The way to be clear is to discuss patents, copyrights, and
    trademarks separately. See <a href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml</a>
    for more explanation of how this term spreads confusion and
    bias.</p>

    <h3><a name="FOOT34" href="#DOCF34" id="FOOT34">(34)</a></h3>

    <p>Subsequently we have discovered the need to distinguish
    between &ldquo;free software&rdquo; and &ldquo;freeware&rdquo;.
    The term &ldquo;freeware&rdquo; means software you are free to
    redistribute, but usually you are not free to study and change
    the source code, so most of it is not free software. See
    <a href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html</a>
    for more explanation.</p>
