<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Aquamacs has tabs</SPAN>. Press Apple-T to create one. You can switch the general use of tabs on in the Options menu. (Note that while the `tabbar' package is provided and used internally, the actual functionality is different.)
Concept and Code by Nathaniel Cunningham, David&nbsp;Ponce and David Reitter.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">&ldquo;Frame Styles&rdquo; are turned off</SPAN> by default now. This means that there are no major mode specific settings (fonts, colors)  unless the styles are turned back on (Options menu).   There is a  new &ldquo;Clear All Styles&rdquo; menu item, and the wording has been improved. There should be less flicker when  switching buffers. The frame size and position are not changed,  even if the frame leaves the screen.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Revised word wrapping</SPAN>: Soft and hard wrapping can now be recognized automatically (Options / Auto Word Wrap for Text Modes). Also, Soft and Hard wrap modes are now enabled just for the current buffer.  (The former option to automatically enable this is still available via customization of the `text-mode-hook' setting.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Full screen editing</SPAN>: Press Apple-Shift-Return to get into full screen mode. (There are some known problems with this in  conjunction with changing the frame's fonts. These will be addressed  in the future.)
Code by Joel Stanley and David Reitter.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Aquamacs does not create backup files (foo.bar&nbsp;) any longer</SPAN> by default. This way, no unnecessary files won't get in your way any longer. (No Mac application creates these. Use Time Machine or a dedicated backup solution for backup needs.) There is an Option in the &ldquo;Options&rdquo; menu which will turn backups on again.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">The *scratch* buffer is now persistent</SPAN> across sessions.
  It is saved to an internal file, but File / Save As  (or
  Apple-Shift-S or C-x C-w) still allow users to save the file elsewhere.
(To switch this off, customize the `aquamacs-scratch-file' variable to nil.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The position (and height and width) of the (main) frame is now persistent across sessions.  (Customize `initial-frame-alist' as documented to open the first frame somewhere else.)  `default-frame-alist' settings for the frame position and extent of subsequent frames are now respected by default.  Aquamacs will not, however, open frames off the screen.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The tool bar looks like other toolbars on OS X now. Code by Yamamoto Mitsuharu.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We've got better-looking icons (&ldquo;alpha channel&rdquo;) for the tool bar, and labels under the icons like in other OS X programs. (You can save the space for that by customizing `mac-tool-bar-display-mode' to `icons'.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Toolbar items of other modes (such as for LaTeX editing) can be configured via Options / Show/Hide / Toolbar items.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Multi-lingual CocoAspell support: installed dictionaries can now be changed from within Aquamacs.
Code by Nathaniel Cunningham

<P>
</LI>
<LI>&ldquo;Check Spelling as You Type" can now be set as the default for all text modes, in the Edit / Spelling menu.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs generally will not show graphical dialog boxes for confirmation questions (unless the mouse has been used last) any longer.  This ensures greater consistency on multi-screen setups and when the frame was off the visible area of the screen.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Before any minibuffer interaction takes place, Aquamacs will attempt to ensure that the minibuffer is actually visible: this may involve moving frames into a visible area of the screen.  (To turn this behavior off, try M-x smart-frame-positioning-mode RET, or customize the variable of the same name.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs now knows more about multi-screen setups (when it comes to frame positioning).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Preferences and other code defined in Preferences.el now override any customizations: the customization file (`custom-file', i.e. customizations.el) is now loaded before the Emacs Lisp code in Preferences.el.  This may have consequences for individual configurations, but it ultimately allows users to override any semi-automatic customizations in their Emacs Lisp code. (Note that&nbsp;/.emacs is still loaded before the customization file in order to maintain compatibility with GNU Emacs.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Improved LaTeX support</SPAN>: AUCTeX 11.85 included. This brings a number of advantages for LaTeX users, in particular:

<UL>
<LI>Better analysis of errors reported by the LaTeX compiler.
</LI>
<LI>Improved syntax highlighting when editing .tex documents.
</LI>
</UL>
Code by Ralf Angeli, David Kastrup and others.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Searching with Apple-F and Apple-G (isearch) is now more
  comfortable: it will not normally extend a region (unless started
  with C-Space). Apple-G (repeat the search) will always set the mark
  to the beginning of the match so that the region captures the match.
  This allows users to replace the text of the match with something
  else easily.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When the mark is set with C-Space, it is more persistent than
  before: clicking somewhere will not disable it, but extend the
  region, just like moving the point with arrow keys (and other
  movement keys) would do.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>LaTeX mode comes with more appropriate icons now.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Color Themes updated to version 6.6.0.
Code by Xavier Maillard and Jonadab the Unsightly One.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The &ldquo;Buffers&rdquo; menu can now be found on the right hand side of the menu bar.  It is called &ldquo;Window&rdquo;.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The mode line (at the bottom of each frame) now uses the
  system's standard font.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Control-left and Control-right will now move to the beginning or
  end of the line, respectively, as is standard in OS X.  Similarly,
Meta-left and Meta-right will now move forward or back by single
words (this is usually Option-left or Option-right).  (`forward-'
and `backward-sexp-nomark' can now be invoked via C-M-right or -left.)
Suggested by Jean-Christophe Helary.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Apple-[ and Apple-] switch between Emacs windows (i.e., within a
  frame).
 Suggested by Jean-Christophe Helary.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>C-backspace deletes a whole file name (i.e., one part of a path)
  instead of just a word in the minibuffer when a file is selected.
  M-backspace (usually Option-backspace) deletes the portion of the word to the left, as is
  standard, while M-delete (usually Option-delete) the one to the right.  If a region is
  marked, that is deleted.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>M-e (forward-sentence) and M-a (backward-sentence) do the right
  thing now even if the text does not have two spaces after each
  sentence. (New customization variable `sentence-end-double-space-for-recognition'.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Apple-F and Apple-G (search, repeat the search) will now mark
  the found text as region as is standard.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Apple-V can now me used immediately after entering isearch (Apple-F) in order to look for the text stored in the pasteboard.
Suggested by Nathaniel Cunningham.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Apple-2 (split window) will now select the newly created window.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Improved usability in the Options menu: Wrap options greyed out when not in a text mode, and no more &ldquo;save places&rdquo; option.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>There's a new &ldquo;Check for Updates&rdquo; menu item in the Aquamacs
  menu.  If a new version is available, it can be downloaded using a
  key binding (C-h u).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Undo/Redo toolbar and menu items are disabled/enabled at the right times (i.e., when there is something to undo/redo).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>&ldquo;Search&rdquo; toolbar item is not shown by default.   &ldquo;History&rdquo; and &ldquo;Redo&rdquo; items are shown by default. (Use   the Options / Show/Hide / Toolbar menu to configure.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The context menu now allows to &ldquo;search on this Mac&rdquo; with Spotlight (on OS X 10.4 or newer).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Font settings for a frame do not affect the mode-line   any longer. You can M-x customize-face mode-line,   specifying a standard OS X font as &ldquo;Font family&rdquo; (such   as Monaco).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Files are loaded (visited) a little faster now.  `default-major-mode' now defaults to `fundamental-mode' rather than `text-mode', which should have no practical consequences apart from the speed-up.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Worked around a bug in OS X that caused occasional, very slow program start on some systems.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>User-supplied settings of `fill-column' should now be   respected (used for hard word wrapping as enabled in the   Options menu). Reported by Ivan Werning.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Some commands (such as M-x shell) will use the current window rather than showing a new one, unless `one-buffer-one-frame-mode' (Options / Show Buffers in New Frames) is enabled.  Suggested by Jean-Christophe Helary.

<P>
</LI>
