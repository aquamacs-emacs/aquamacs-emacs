<h2 class="chapter">2 Help for users</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Netrc&rdquo; files are a de facto standard.  They look like this:
<pre class="example">     machine <var>mymachine</var> login <var>myloginname</var> password <var>mypassword</var> port <var>myport</var>
</pre>
   <p>The machine is the server (either a DNS name or an IP address).

   <p>The port is optional.  If it's missing, auth-source will assume any
port is OK.  Actually the port is a protocol name or a port number so
you can have separate entries for port <var>143</var> and for protocol
<var>imap</var> if you fancy that.  Anyway, you can just omit the port if
you don't need it.

   <p>The login and password are simply your login credentials to the server.

   <p>&ldquo;Netrc&rdquo; files are usually called <code>.authinfo</code> or <code>.netrc</code>;
nowadays <code>.authinfo</code> seems to be more popular and the auth-source
library encourages this confusion by making it the default, as you'll
see later.

   <p>If you have problems with the port, set <code>auth-source-debug</code> to
<code>t</code> and see what port the library is checking in the
<code>*Messages*</code> buffer.  Ditto for any other problems, your first
step is always to see what's being checked.  The second step, of
course, is to write a blog entry about it and wait for the answer in
the comments.

   <p>You can customize the variable <code>auth-sources</code>.  The following may
be needed if you are using an older version of Emacs or if the
auth-source library is not loaded for some other reason.

<pre class="lisp">     (require 'auth-source)             ;; probably not necessary
     (customize-variable 'auth-sources) ;; optional, do it once
</pre>
   <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>auth-sources</b><var><a name="index-auth_002dsources-1"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p>The <code>auth-sources</code> variable tells the auth-source library where
your netrc files live for a particular host and protocol.  While you
can get fancy, the default and simplest configuration is:

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq auth-sources '((:source "~/.authinfo.gpg" :host t :protocol t)))
</pre>
        <p>This says &ldquo;for any host and any protocol, use just that one file.&rdquo;
Sweet simplicity.  In fact, this is already the default, so unless you
want to move your netrc file, it will just work if you have that
file.  You may not, though, so make sure it exists.

        <p>By adding multiple entries to <code>auth-sources</code> with a particular
host or protocol, you can have specific netrc files for that host or
protocol.  Usually this is unnecessary but may make sense if you have
shared netrc files or some other unusual setup (90% of Emacs users
have unusual setups and the remaining 10% are <em>really</em> unusual).

        </blockquote></div>

   <p>If you don't customize <code>auth-sources</code>, you'll have to live with
the defaults: any host and any port are looked up in the netrc
file <code>~/.authinfo.gpg</code>.  This is an encrypted file if and only if
you set up EPA, which is strongly recommended.

<pre class="lisp">     (require 'epa-file)
     (epa-file-enable)
     ;;; VERY important if you want symmetric encryption
     ;;; irrelevant if you don't
     (setq epa-file-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption t)
</pre>
   <p>The simplest working netrc line example is one without a port.

<pre class="example">     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password YOURPASSWORD
</pre>
   <p>This will match any authentication port.  Simple, right?  But what if
there's a SMTP server on port 433 of that machine that needs a
different password from the IMAP server?

<pre class="example">     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password SMTPPASSWORD port 433
     machine YOURMACHINE login YOU password GENERALPASSWORD
</pre>
   <p>For url-auth authentication (HTTP/HTTPS), you need to put this in your
netrc file:

<pre class="example">     machine yourmachine.com:80 port http login testuser password testpass
</pre>
   <p>This will match any realm and authentication method (basic or digest)
over HTTP.  HTTPS is set up similarly.  If you want finer controls,
explore the url-auth source code and variables.

   <p>For Tramp authentication, use:

<pre class="example">     machine yourmachine.com port scp login testuser password testpass
</pre>
   <p>Note that the port denotes the Tramp connection method.  When you
don't use a port entry, you match any Tramp method, as explained
earlier.  Since Tramp has about 88 connection methods, this may be
necessary if you have an unusual (see earlier comment on those) setup.
