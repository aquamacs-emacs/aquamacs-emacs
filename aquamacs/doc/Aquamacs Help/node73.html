</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Summary:</SPAN> New functions: Mac-style printing, Export to PDF and
        HTML, Spelling suggestions, New buffer in mode / change major mode
        menus, a context menu (right mouse click), speed improvements,
        nXML and AUCTeX included text display improved (international
        characters and proportional fonts), "wrong command-p" bug fixed
        and much more.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Printing: Aquamacs now supports full What-you-see-is-what-
        you-get printing. Choose 'Preview and Print' from the File menu,
        and the current buffer (or the current region, if one is marked)
        is typeset using the color theme and the syntax coloring that is
        active. You can then preview or print it with the standard Mac OS
        X printing dialogs, selecting a standard Mac printer. (Output to
        US Letter format only at this point. Sorry!)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Export to PDF and HTML: The current buffer (or a region if
        selected) can now be exported to a PDF or HTML file. Syntax
        coloring (and the chosen color theme except for the background
        color) are respected.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>LaTeX: Aquamacs now comes with the latest version of
        AUCTeX, which will allow you to most comfortably edit LaTeX source
        code and even preview some of the results (e.g. formulas) directly
        in your document.  No need to install an additional AUCTeX
        package.        AUCTeX already works out-of-the box.

<P>
It is recommended that you remove any previous installations of
        AUCTeX.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>nXML: Edit XML code more comfortably with the included
        nxml-mode. It validates the document as you type. If you don't
        like the mode, the following in your Preferences.el file will
        bring the old XML mode back:

<P>
<PRE>
(assq-set-equal "&lt;\\?xml " 'xml-mode
                           'magic-mode-alist)
</PRE>

<P>
Suggestion from Tim Bray.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Speed: Aquamacs is a little faster now when opening new frames,
        when frame appearance styles have been defined.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Right-Mouse-clicks in text now bring up a context menu which
        allows you to copy/paste, search the word under the mouse in
        Google or look it up in the system dictionary and switch the buffer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Control-Mouse-click is always mapped to mouse-3 (right mouse
        button) now so Apple mouse and laptop users will consistently get the same
        functionality. To do mouse-2, just hold down the Command key while
        clicking. (This does mouse-yank-at-click, a useful functionality that you
        might be used to from Linux / X11 machines!)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Alt-Mouse-click&amp;drag allows you to select a secondary
        selection. (This used to be on Command-mouse-1-drag.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Spelling correction (flyspell) will make suggestions upon
        right-clicking on a misspelled word.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fonts/Display: Aquamacs Emacs can now display an even wider
        range of characters with any font available on OS X. Some
        characters will look nicer.
        Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Text Display: Aquamacs now displays text in variable-width fonts
        with much better letter-spacing. It'll look like in other OS X
        apps, and reading and editing long texts is much more fun now.
        Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Navigation in wrapped lines (not word wrap) is easier now: arrow
        keys will jump to the next visual line, not to the next
        buffer/file line. Also, navigation is visual now for variable
        width fonts like Lucida: jumping up or down moves to roughly the
        same place in the adjacent line going after what's displayed on
        the screen rather than counting characters (jumping to the same
        row number in the next line).  If you don't like the behavior, you
        can turn it off with this code in your Preferences.el / .emacs
        file:

<P>
<PRE>
(define-key osx-key-mode-map [remap previous-line]
            'previous-line)

(define-key osx-key-mode-map [remap next-line]
            'next-line)
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Scrolling and setting the point with the mouse has improved:
        `scroll-margin' defaults to 0 now, so scrolling won't happen until
        you've reached the first or last line in the window - except when
        you use the cursor up/down keys (and osx-key-mode is on). Then,
        scrolling takes place a few lines before you reach the
        boundary. You can configure this via Aquamacs' customization
        variable `visual-scroll-margin'.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Command-{ comments the line or the region (in programming modes)
</LI>
<LI>Command-} uncomments the line or the region (in programming
        modes)
</LI>
<LI>Command-' comments or uncomments (toggling) the line or
        the region (in programming modes)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Command-Delete kills (erases) the rest of the current
        line. (Command-Backspace kills the whole line.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Filenames with spaces can now be entered without hassle.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Modifier-Key configuration: Several previously deprecated
        variables have been removed: `mac-reverse-ctrl-meta' and
        'mac-command-key-is-meta'. Use the much simpler, yet
        equally powerful variables `mac-command-modifier',
        `mac-option-modifier', `mac-control-modifier' and
        `mac-function-modifier' (experimental) instead.
        Additionally, `mac-pass-option-to-system' is deprecated now:
        instead, set `mac-option-modifier' to nil to reach the same
        effect. The use of the Option menu is recommended.

<P>
To set the Apple key to Meta (not recommended), add this to your
        Preferences.el file:

<P>
tt (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fn-key can act as Meta. If you have an Fn key on your laptop,
        you can use it as Meta key now. Add this to your Preferences.el
        file:

<P>
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">(setq mac-function-modifier 'meta)</SPAN>

<P>
Note that support of the Fn key is experimental. Rare
        combinations may fail on non-English keyboard layouts,
        and some keys will not work correctly in combination with Fn and Shift.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Modifier keys such as Command or Shift show up correctly in the
        shortcuts (menu)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>New-Buffer menu contains many more modes now, such as modes for
        Fortran, ObjectiveC, C++, PHP, CSS, JavaScript...
        You can add your own in the customization variable
        `aquamacs-known-major-modes'. The menu is updated automatically.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Change-Buffer-Mode menu (in File menu) allows to change the mode
        of the current buffer to something hopefully more useful.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Recently used major modes are now displayed in New-Buffer and
        Change-Buffer-Mode menus .

<P>
</LI>
<LI>M-w (kill-ring-save) will now deactivate the mark after saving
        the region, that is deselect the region, just like on standard
        Emacs. Apple-C will not deselect the region, just like it's done
        on the Mac.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Run executables from within Emacs that lie in your PATH as
        set in shell init files. Aquamacs will set `exec-path'
        automatically from PATH.  We don't add paths to exec-path any
        more (except one default tetex path for AUCTeX).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Questions like "Save to file before closing?" will be asked with
        a proper dialog and not with a menu appearing out of nothing - if
        the last action was carried out with the mouse.

<P>
Thanks to CarbonEmacsJP project for part of this.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Info mode: C-h i  will bring up not only up-to-date info nodes
        for Emacs, but also info on installed packages on the system.
        (unless you have an INFOPATH environment variable set)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Mode-specific styles: With a new menu function, you can now
        apply the style assigned to some other mode, effectively copying
        it over.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Mode-specific styles are not applied any more for the major-mode
        of buffers shown in temporary windows inside frames such as the
</LI>
<LI>Completions* buffer. This prevents ugly font-switching etc. for
        the whole frame when just a small window is opened inside the frame.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>New Packages: findr, htmlize, ruby's friends, auctex
        (latex-mode), nxml-mode, matlab-mode, javascript-mode,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Notable Updated external packages: ruby-mode, ruby-*, carbon-font

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Apple/Command key is now called 'A-' internally because it looks
        like "Apple-" (while it's really the otherwise unused "Alt" key).
        It used to be "H-" (or: hyper), so change your configuration code
        in case you've defined your own shortcuts.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>One-Buffer-One-Frame is a minor mode now (called
        one-buffer-one-frame-mode). Use the Options menu (and Save
        Options) to turn it on/off, as before.
        In this minor mode, you have some additional key bindings now:

<P>
C-x B, C-x C-B, C-x S-left, C-x S-right
        they all do the same as their corresponding functions without the
        Shift key, but they will show the buffer that they are switching
        to in the same window, even though one-buffer-one-frame-mode is on.

<P>
The mode has been revised to open fewer extra windows when their
        content is related to a specific frame - for example version
        control checkin comments.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Manual: The Emacs Manual that comes with Aquamacs (as an Apple
        Help document) has been updated to reflect the basis of Aquamacs,
        namely the upcoming Emacs 22.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Command-p-Bugfix: For some users, Emacs locked up at random
        times, showing a message like (wrong command-p ...) in the echo
        area of a frame on every input. This bug in the underlying GNU
        Emacs should be fixed now.
        Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu, Richard Stallman, et al.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Aquamacs now correctly remembers the positions of frames
        with specific files, so they open again on the same screen
        position if the file is re-loaded (in the same session, or after
        "Save Options" in the next session).
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Bookmarks did not work with `one-buffer-one-frame'
        turned on.
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Some Show/Hide options weren't saved by
        "Save Options".
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: links from describe-variable/function help buffers to the
        source files are correct now for the Aquamacs-specific objects
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Aquamacs works fine now on systems where, in the default
        shell (e.g. via .bash profile), functions have been defined and
        exported.
        Reported by Terry Jones
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: RefTeX mode does't give constant audio signals (errors)
        any more in certain situations
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Allout mode should work again (saving files)
        Reported by Gerry Brush
        Patch by Ken Mannheimer
