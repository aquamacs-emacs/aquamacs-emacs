<h2 class="chapter">1 Using Skeletons</h2>

<p><a name="index-skeletons-1"></a><a name="index-using-skeletons-2"></a>
  When you want Emacs to insert a form letter or a typical construct of the
programming language you are using, skeletons are a means of accomplishing
this.  Normally skeletons each have a command of their own, that, when called,
will insert the skeleton.  These commands can be issued in the usual ways
(see <a href="../emacs/Commands.html#g_t_0028emacs_0029Commands">(emacs)Commands</a>).  Modes that offer various skeletons will often
bind these to key-sequences on the <kbd>C-c</kbd> prefix, as well as having
an <cite>Insert</cite> menu and maybe even predefined abbrevs for them
(see <a href="Skeletons-as-Abbrevs.html#Skeletons-as-Abbrevs">Skeletons as Abbrevs</a>).

   <p>The simplest kind of skeleton will simply insert some text indented
according to the major mode and leave the cursor at a likely place in the
middle.  Interactive skeletons may prompt you for a string that will be part
of the inserted text.

   <p>Skeletons may ask for input several times.  They even have a looping
mechanism in which you will be asked for input as long as you are willing to
furnish it.  An example would be multiple &ldquo;else if&rdquo; conditions.  You can
recognize this situation by a prompt ending in &lt;RET&gt;, <kbd>C-g</kbd>
or <kbd>C-h</kbd>.  This
means that entering an empty string will simply assume that you are finished. 
Typing quit on the other hand terminates the loop but also the rest of the
skeleton, e.g. an &ldquo;else&rdquo; clause is skipped.  Only a syntactically necessary
termination still gets inserted.
