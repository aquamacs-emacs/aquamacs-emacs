<h2 class="chapter">6 Autoinserting Text in Empty Files</h2>

<p><a name="index-autoinserting-16"></a>
<a name="index-auto_002dinsert-17"></a>  <kbd>M-x auto-insert</kbd> will put some predefined text at the beginning of
the buffer.  The main application for this function, as its name suggests,
is to have it be called automatically every time an empty, and only an
empty file is visited.  This is accomplished by putting <code>(add-hook
'find-file-hook 'auto-insert)</code> into your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> file
(see <a href="../emacs/Init-File.html#g_t_0028emacs_0029Init-File">(emacs)Init File</a>).

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dinsert_002dalist-18"></a>  What gets inserted, if anything, is determined by the variable
<code>auto-insert-alist</code>.  The <span class="sc">car</span>s of this list are each either
a mode name, making an element applicable when a buffer is in that
mode.  Or they can be a string, which is a regexp matched against the
buffer's file name.  In that way different kinds of files that have
the same mode in Emacs can be distinguished.  The <span class="sc">car</span>s may also
be cons cells consisting of mode name or regexp as above and an
additional descriptive string.

   <p>When a matching element is found, the <span class="sc">cdr</span> says what to do.  It may
be a string, which is a file name, whose contents are to be inserted, if
that file is found in the directory <code>auto-insert-directory</code> or under a
absolute file name.  Or it can be a skeleton (see <a href="Skeleton-Language.html#Skeleton-Language">Skeleton Language</a>) to
be inserted.

   <p>It can also be a function, which allows doing various things.  The function
can simply insert some text, indeed, it can be skeleton command (see <a href="Using-Skeletons.html#Using-Skeletons">Using Skeletons</a>).  It can be a lambda function which will for example conditionally
call another function.  Or it can even reset the mode for the buffer. If you
want to perform several such actions in order, you use a vector, i.e. several
of the above elements between square brackets (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p>By default C and C++ headers insert a definition of a symbol derived from
the filename to prevent multiple inclusions.  C and C++ sources insert an
include of the header.  Makefiles insert the file makefile.inc if it exists.

   <p>TeX and bibTeX mode files insert the file tex-insert.tex if it exists, while
LaTeX mode files insert a typical <code>\documentclass</code> frame.  Html
files insert a skeleton with the usual frame.

   <p>Ada mode files call the Ada header skeleton command.  Emacs lisp
source files insert the usual header, with a copyright of your
environment variable <samp><span class="env">$ORGANIZATION</span></samp> or else the FSF, and prompt
for valid keywords describing the contents.  Files in a <samp><span class="file">bin</span></samp>
directory for which Emacs could determine no specialized mode
(see <a href="../emacs/Choosing-Modes.html#g_t_0028emacs_0029Choosing-Modes">(emacs)Choosing Modes</a>) are set to Shell script mode.

   <p><a name="index-define_002dauto_002dinsert-19"></a>  In Lisp (see <a href="../emacs/Init-File.html#g_t_0028emacs_0029Init-File">(emacs)Init File</a>) you can use the function
<code>define-auto-insert</code> to add to or modify
<code>auto-insert-alist</code>.  See its documentation with <kbd>C-h f
define-auto-insert</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dinsert-20"></a>  The variable <code>auto-insert</code> says what to do when <code>auto-insert</code> is
called non-interactively, e.g. when a newly found file is empty (see above):
     <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>Do nothing. 
<br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Insert something if possible, i.e. there is a matching entry in
<code>auto-insert-alist</code>. 
<br><dt>other<dd>Insert something if possible, but mark as unmodified. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dinsert_002dquery-21"></a>  The variable <code>auto-insert-query</code> controls whether to ask about
inserting something.  When this is <code>nil</code>, inserting is only done with
<kbd>M-x auto-insert</kbd>.  When this is <code>function</code>, you are queried
whenever <code>auto-insert</code> is called as a function, such as when Emacs
visits an empty file and you have set the above-mentioned hook.  Otherwise
you are alway queried.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dinsert_002dprompt-22"></a>  When querying, the variable <code>auto-insert-prompt</code>'s value is used as a
prompt for a y-or-n-type question.  If this includes a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; construct,
that is replaced by what caused the insertion rule to be chosen.  This is
either a descriptive text, the mode-name of the buffer or the regular
expression that matched the filename.
