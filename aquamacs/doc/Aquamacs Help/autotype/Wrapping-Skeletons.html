<h2 class="chapter">2 Wrapping Skeletons Around Existing Text</h2>

<p><a name="index-wrapping-skeletons-3"></a>
  Often you will find yourself with some code that for whatever reason
suddenly becomes conditional.  Or you have written a bit of text and want to
put it in the middle of a form letter.  Skeletons provide a means for
accomplishing this, and can even, in the case of programming languages,
reindent the wrapped code for you.

   <p>Skeleton commands take an optional numeric prefix argument
(see <a href="../emacs/Arguments.html#g_t_0028emacs_0029Arguments">(emacs)Arguments</a>).  This is interpreted in two different ways depending
on whether the prefix is positive, i.e. forwards oriented or negative,
i.e. backwards oriented.

   <p>A positive prefix means to wrap the skeleton around that many
following words.  This is accomplished by putting the words there where
the point is normally left after that skeleton is inserted (see <a href="Using-Skeletons.html#Using-Skeletons">Using Skeletons</a>).  The point (see <a href="../emacs/Point.html#g_t_0028emacs_0029Point">(emacs)Point</a>) is left at the next
interesting spot in the skeleton instead.

   <p>A negative prefix means to do something similar with that many precedingly
marked interregions (see <a href="../emacs/Mark.html#g_t_0028emacs_0029Mark">(emacs)Mark</a>).  In the simplest case, if you type
<kbd>M--</kbd> just before issuing the skeleton command, that will wrap the
skeleton around the current region, just like a positive argument would have
wrapped it around a number of words.

   <p>Smaller negative arguments will wrap that many interregions into successive
interesting spots within the skeleton, again leaving the point at the next one. 
We speak about interregions rather than regions here, because we treat them in
the order they appear in the buffer, which coincides with successive regions
only if they were marked in order.

   <p>That is, if you marked in alphabetical order the points A B C [] (where []
represents the point) and call a skeleton command with <kbd>M-- 3</kbd>, you will
wrap the text from A to B into the first interesting spot of the skeleton, the
text from B to C into the next one, the text from C to the point into the
third one, and leave the point in the fourth one.  If there are less marks in
the buffer, or if the skeleton defines less interesting points, the surplus is
ignored.

   <p>If, on the other hand, you marked in alphabetical order the points [] A C B,
and call a skeleton command with <kbd>M-- 3</kbd>, you will wrap the text from
point to A, then the text from A to C and finally the text from C to B.  This
is done because the regions overlap and Emacs would be helplessly lost if it
tried to follow the order in which you marked these points.
