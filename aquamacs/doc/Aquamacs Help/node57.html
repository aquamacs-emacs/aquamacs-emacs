Changes&mdash; 2.0</A>
</H2>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Aquamacs is now based on Emacs 23 and the Cocoa NextStep port.  There are many changes under the hood associated with this, but also a plethora of visible improvements.  Major ones, and those pertaining to Aquamacs specifically, are listed here.  Further changes can be found in the NEWS file for Emacs 23.</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Major User Interface Improvements</SPAN>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Spell-checking now uses the system-wide dictionaries in all the languages supported on OS X.  The standard spelling user interface is available as well as the traditional Emacs `ispell' interface (which also uses the system-wide spelling mechanism).  Configure the use of GNU `aspell' through the `ispell-program-name' variable if desired.

<P>
Code by Nathaniel Cunningham.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs has a new icon in the Dock, designed by graphic designer Jessica Walker (jekawacaneer@gmail.com).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The Aquamacs application has been renamed to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Aquamacs.app</SPAN> (from Aquamacs Emacs.app).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Dialogs have been vastly improved: they appear as sheets over the frames where they belong, contain better UI elements (as in the case of the dialog displayed before quitting Aquamacs, which was once called &ldquo;dialog from hell&rdquo; before receiving a makeover).  The standard Enter, Space and Esc keys (and more) are supported.  &ldquo;File Save&rdquo; panels also appear as sheets.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Toolbars can now be configured through the normal customization panel.  Right-click on the toolbar, use the Options/View menu item (or use M-x ns-tool-bar-customize).  The chosen icons are persistent; toolbar customizations are, however, tied to the toolbars set by modes.  That means that users can chose a different set of icons to display in latex-mode, for instance.
The `ns-tool-bar-display-mode' variable now supports label-only toolbars.  Right-click on the toolbar to change; or use M-x customize or <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Preferences.el</SPAN> to set it to `labels' in order to only show labels.  The former meaning of this value (showing labels and icons) is now `both' (or, usually, nil, the default).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fonts and colors of all (mode-specific) faces can now be configured using the standard font and color panels.  The Options / Appearance menu provides a function to show the font panel, which leads to buttons for foreground and background colors.   We also have a menu item for the color panel separately, from where colors can be dragged&amp;dropped directly onto any piece of text to customize its face.  Holding down the Option key will, instead, set the face's background color.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The printing system has been revised; the standard print and page setup dialogs are used inside the application.  The print dialog now appears more quickly.  (Note: over-long lines will always be wrapped at word boundaries when printing. Clipping or horizontal pagination are not supported at this time.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Line wrapping is now set to Truncate, Wrap, Word Wrap and Line Breaking (auto fill) under <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Options / Line Wrapping</SPAN> for the current buffer.  A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Set as Default</SPAN> will set it as default for all buffers that have no explicit line wrap setting.  As before, there is also a setting to detect word wrap in text files.  When it is on, Aquamacs detects the wrapping style of text-mode buffers automatically, but prefers word wrapping (see the customization variable `auto-word-wrap-default-function').
<SPAN CLASS="SPAN">Word Wrapping translates to `visual-line-mode' internally now, and the former Aquamacs 1.x mode of the same name now corresponds to a customization variable called `line-move-visual', which is enabled by default.  `Longlines-mode' is obsolete.   Users with manual customizations should adjust their settings.  Fine control can be achieved by customizing `visual-line-mode', `word-wrap', `truncate-lines', and `auto-fill-mode'.</SPAN>

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Key Bindings</SPAN>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It is now possible to customize behavior of right Option/Alternate, Command and Control modifiers independently of the left ones using new entries in the (renamed) &ldquo;Option, Command, Meta keys&rdquo; menu (in Options) or the new customization variables named `ns-right-alternate-modifier' (etc).
Patch by Marcin Koziej.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Even when the Option modifier keys are set up to be handled by the system (rather than being Meta - see Options - Option Key menu), Option-Arrow and Option-Delete key combinations lead to wordwise operations (they are recognized as Meta).  (Set the new `ns-alternate-meta-special-codes'  to nil to disable.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Note that Word Wrapping (`visual-line-mode') affects the function of the cursor movement keys (arrows, and C-a, C-e, C-p and C-n).  In Aquamacs, this can be easily customized.  The default is as such:

<UL>
<LI>In Word Wrapping (visual-line-mode), C-aenp and arrow keys move according to visual lines.
</LI>
<LI>Without Word Wrapping (visual-line-mode off), arrow keys move visually, but C-aenp move non-visually according to buffer lines as in Emacs 22 and Aquamacs 1.x.
</LI>
</UL>
Users may configure this behavior via the (new) `line-move-visual' customization variable.  Set it to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">t</SPAN> for unconditional visual movement of all keys, and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">nil</SPAN> for unconditional logical (buffer) movement of all keys.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Keyboard bindings are displayed more consistently in the menus now.  Throughout Aquamacs,  Mac standard key descriptions are used (this may be configured using the variable `ns-use-mac-modifier-symbols').  Users should be aware that manuals and tutorials will often refer to keys such as <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">C-x</SPAN> (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">X&#x302;</SPAN> or Control X), and that keys like <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">M-q</SPAN> correspond to the chosen Meta key modifier, normally the Option key.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tabs are now available via the A-1..9 (Command-1..9) keybindings.  `Split-window-vertically' is now bound to A-M-2 (Command Option 2), `split-window-horizontally' is A-M-3 (Command Option 3).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Command-~&nbsp;now cycles backward to the previously selected frame (`raise-previous-frame').
Patch by Matthew Dempsky.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Command-Meta-; now runs `flyspell-buffer', which marks all misspellings in the current buffer.
Patch by Nathaniel Cunningham.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Command-PageUp/PageDown now jump to the beginning or end of the buffer, respectively (`beginning-of-buffer', `end-of-buffer').

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When `osx-key-mode' is switched off, `x-select-enable-clipboard' is restored to its (new) default value, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">t</SPAN>. That means that kill and yank operations (C-w, C-y, mouse text selection and more) are integrated with the Mac pasteboard.  When `osx-key-mode' is on (as is default), everything is as in previous Aquamacs versions: the standard copy&amp;paste operations (A-c, A-v) use the system pasteboard, while the killring operations from traditional Emacs do not.
Suggested by Jos√© M Figueroa-O'Farrill.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Editing and Major Modes</SPAN>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Internally, Emacs is based on a superset of Unicode now.  Emacs also uses Cocoa, a modern technology that facilitates program development and maintenance, supports 64-bit computing on Macs and allows for better integration of applications with the operating system and other applications.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Semantic features and Project Support (EDE) are now included in Emacs and available from the Tools menu.  Note that the JDEE plugin distributed with earlier versions of Aquamacs is not compatible (and prevents functioning of the new functionality.  You should remove it (from <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">/Library/Application Support/Aquamacs Emacs/JDEE</SPAN>) or update to a new version of the plugin.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>AUCTeX has ben updated to version 11.86 (was: 11.85).  LaTeX editing has become more comfortable with this version. For the details, please see <SPAN CLASS="SPAN"><kbd><A ID="tex2html58"
  HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex/Changes.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex/Changes.html</A></kbd></SPAN>.  The new version improves synchronization with viewer programs. Internally, Skim.app integration has changed: Skim is always used for all View commands (like C-c C-v)  if it is already running (customize variable `TeX-view-program-selection' to control this).  `TeX-source-correlate-mode' is on by default in Aquamacs (disable by customizing `TeX-mode-hook': remove `aquamacs-latex-viewer-support').  To manually change the Viewer used for various kinds of files (DVI, PDF, PS), select &ldquo;LaTeX&rdquo; / &ldquo;Customize&rdquo; and navigate to &ldquo;TeX Command&rdquo;, &ldquo;TeX View&rdquo;, &ldquo;TeX View Program Selection&rdquo;. There, choose, for instance, Xdvi for the viewer in DVI mode, Skim or Preview for PDF mode.

<P>
Patch by Konrad Podczeck and David Reitter.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>TeX / LaTeX macros are now found more reliably when using TeXLive (`TeX-macro-global' is configured differently).
Reported by Wolfgang Meiners.  
<P>
</LI>
<LI>LaTeX master files in different directories are now found reliably when calling `Jump to PDF'.
Reported buy Mac Pigman.  
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs uses &ldquo;Python-mode&rdquo; by default now for Python source files.  Users who prefer the original Emacs python package can switch by including <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">(require 'python)</SPAN> in their <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Preferences.el</SPAN> file.
Code by Barry Warsaw.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) has been updated to version 5.8 (was: 5.3.10).  Refer to the ESS website for changes (<SPAN CLASS="SPAN"> <kbd><A ID="tex2html59"
  HREF="http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/readme.html#New-Features">http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/readme.html#New-Features</A></kbd></SPAN>).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Ruby mode has been revised to match and track the latest version included with GNU Emacs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Many more improvements between Emacs 22 and Emacs 23. See etc/NEWS at <kbd><A ID="tex2html60"
  HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.1">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.1</A></kbd>.  NB, many of the items listed there do not apply to Mac OS X.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>DocView mode is no longer used to display PDF and other files (it didn't work well).

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">.wiki</SPAN> files now open in wikipedia-mode.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Miscellany</SPAN>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Aquamacs 2.x requires Mac OS X 10.6, or 10.5.8 or later.  (OS X 10.4 users may compile from source at their own risk.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When printing, double spaces are formatted as such and can be used to align text.
Reported by George Nurser.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>HTML and PDF export functions have changed: PDF export can be achieved as in any Mac application via the Print dialog.  Use the new <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Copy as HTML</SPAN> function in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Edit</SPAN> menu to copy formatted text including all the coloring into the clipboard in HTML format.  Many other applications, including presentation software, can then display the formatted text and keep it editable.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fullscreen mode works largely as before in Mac OS X 10.6; in older versions of OS X, it will unconditionally take over the full screen (Dock and menu are not visible).  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Note: there are known issues related to scrollbars when returning from fullscreen mode.  These will be addressed in the next version of Aquamacs.</SPAN>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>`aquamacs-find-file' (C-x C-f) will ask for confirmation if you first complete partial filename input in the minibuffer, but then attempt to create a new file.
</LI>
<LI>Completion is, in many cases, more powerful by completing to the left <SPAN  CLASS="textit">and</SPAN> the right of the input string.  Customize the option `completion-styles' to control this.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>As per Emacs 23, Aquamacs now supports multi-file commits in distributed version-control systems through the VC-dir package.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Users who have included `turn-on-auto-fill' or `turn-on-word-wrap' in their customization of `text-mode-hook' or other hooks are advised to change this to `set-auto-fill', or `set-word-wrap', respectively.  These functions are more comprehensive and disable (usually) nonsensical alternatives.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A new customization variable `aquamacs-default-major-mode' is provided to set the default major mode of newly opened, empty buffers.  (We recommend keeping `default-major-mode' at `fundamental-mode'.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The appearance of the echo area (at the bottom of each frame) can now be configured via M-x customize-face RET echo-area RET.  Besides the echo area in general, note the more specific faces `minibuffer-prompt' and the new `minibuffer' face.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The Aquamacs Help books (Apple Help) are now displayed more reliably when multiple versions of Aquamacs are present on the system.  The Emacs Lisp Reference as well as the Emacs Manual are up to date.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Auto Save files are now stored in ~/Library/Caches/Aquamacs Emacs.  This way, they survive reboots such as after system crashes (kernel panics, etc.).
Reported by Neil Best, Justin Pitts and Richard Busby.  
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Auto Save files and Session files are purged after 31 days. 
<P>
</LI>
<LI>In some circumstances, point position was changed when switching back and forth between tabs directly and also via other buffer-switching mechanisms such as opening new files.  
<P>
</LI>
</UL>
