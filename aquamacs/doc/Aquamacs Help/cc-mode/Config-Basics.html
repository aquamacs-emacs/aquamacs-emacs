<h2 class="chapter">6 Configuration Basics</h2>

<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
<p><a name="index-Emacs-Initialization-File-264"></a><a name="index-Configuration-265"></a>You configure CC Mode by setting Lisp variables and calling (and
perhaps writing) Lisp functions<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, which is usually done by adding code to an Emacs
initialization file.  This file might be <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">init.el</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp> or perhaps some
other file.  See <a href="../emacs/Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>.  For
the sake of conciseness, we just call this file &ldquo;your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>&rdquo;
throughout the rest of the manual.

   <p>Several of these variables (currently 16), are known collectively as
<dfn>style variables</dfn>.  CC Mode provides a special mechanism, known
as <dfn>styles</dfn> to make it easier to set these variables as a group,
to &ldquo;inherit&rdquo; settings from one style into another, and so on.  Style
variables remain ordinary Lisp variables, whose values can be read and
changed independently of the style system.  See <a href="Style-Variables.html#Style-Variables">Style Variables</a>.

   <p>There are several ways you can write the code, depending on the
precise effect you want&mdash;they are described further down on this page. 
If you are new to CC Mode, we suggest you begin with the simplest
method, &ldquo;Top-level commands or the customization interface&rdquo;.

   <p>If you make conflicting settings in several of these ways, the way
that takes precedence is the one that appears latest in this list:
     <ul>
<li>
          <dl>
<dt>Style<dt>File Style<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a><dt>Top-level command or &ldquo;customization interface&rdquo;<dt>Hook<dt>File Local Variable setting<dd></dl>
     </ul>

   <p>Here is a summary of the different ways of writing your configuration
settings:

     <dl>
<dt>Top-level commands or the &ldquo;customization interface&rdquo;<dd>Most simply, you can write <code>setq</code> and similar commands at the top
level of your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  When you load a CC Mode buffer,
it initializes its configuration from these global values (at least,
for those settings you have given values to), so it makes sense to
have these <code>setq</code> commands run <em>before</em> CC Mode is first
initialized&mdash;in particular, before any call to <code>desktop-read</code>
(see <a href="../emacs/Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html#Saving-Emacs-Sessions">Saving Emacs Sessions</a>).  For
example, you might set c-basic-offset thus:

     <pre class="example">          (setq c-basic-offset 4)
</pre>
     <p>You can use the more user friendly Customization interface instead,
but this manual does not cover in detail how that works.  To do this,
start by typing <kbd>M-x customize-group &lt;RET&gt; c &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
See <a href="../emacs/Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>. 
<!-- The following note really belongs in the Emacs manual. -->
Emacs normally writes the customizations at the end of your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  If you use <code>desktop-read</code>, you should edit
your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> to place the call to <code>desktop-read</code> <em>after</em>
the customizations.

     <p>The first initialization of CC Mode puts a snapshot of the
configuration settings into the special style <code>user</code>. 
See <a href="Built_002din-Styles.html#Built_002din-Styles">Built-in Styles</a>.

     <p>For basic use of Emacs, either of these ways of configuring is
adequate.  However, the settings are then the same in all CC Mode
buffers and it can be clumsy to communicate them between programmers. 
For more flexibility, you'll want to use one (or both) of CC Mode's
more sophisticated facilities, hooks and styles.

     <br><dt>Hooks<dd>An Emacs <dfn>hook</dfn> is a place to put Lisp functions that you want
Emacs to execute later in specific circumstances. 
See <a href="../elisp/Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.  CC Mode supplies a main
hook and a language-specific hook for each language it supports - any
functions you put onto these hooks get executed as the last part of a
buffer's initialization.  Typically you put most of your customization
within the main hook, and use the language-specific hooks to vary the
customization settings between language modes.  For example, if you
wanted different (non-standard) values of <code>c-basic-offset</code> in C
Mode and Java Mode buffers, you could do it like this:

     <pre class="example">          (defun my-c-mode-hook ()
            (setq c-basic-offset 3))
          (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)
          
          (defun my-java-mode-hook ()
            (setq c-basic-offset 6))
          (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'my-java-mode-hook)
</pre>
     <p>See <a href="CC-Hooks.html#CC-Hooks">CC Hooks</a> for more details on the use of CC Mode hooks.

     <br><dt>Styles<dd>A CC Mode <dfn>style</dfn> is a coherent collection of customizations
with a name.  At any time, exactly one style is active in each
CC Mode buffer, either the one you have selected or a default. 
CC Mode is delivered with several existing styles.  Additionally,
you can create your own styles, possibly based on these existing
styles.  If you worked in a programming team called the &ldquo;Free
Group&rdquo;, which had its own coding standards, you might well have this
in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:

     <pre class="example">          (setq c-default-style '((java-mode . "java")
                                  (awk-mode . "awk")
                                  (other . "free-group-style")))
</pre>
     <p>See <a href="Styles.html#Styles">Styles</a> for fuller details on using CC Mode styles and how
to create them.

     <br><dt>File Local Variable setting<dd>A <dfn>file local variable setting</dfn> is a setting which applies to an
individual source file.  You put this in a <dfn>local variables list</dfn>,
a special block at the end of the source file (see <a href="../emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables">Specifying File Variables</a>).

     <br><dt>File Styles<dd>A <dfn>file style</dfn> is a rarely used variant of the &ldquo;style&rdquo; mechanism
described above, which applies to an individual source file. 
See <a href="File-Styles.html#File-Styles">File Styles</a>.  You use this by setting certain special variables
in a local variables list (see <a href="../emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables">Specifying File Variables</a>).

     <br><dt>Hooks with Styles<dd>For ultimate flexibility, you can use hooks and styles together.  For
example, if your team were developing a product which required a
Linux driver, you'd probably want to use the &ldquo;linux&rdquo; style for the
driver, and your own team's style for the rest of the code.  You
could achieve this with code like this in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:

     <pre class="example">          (defun my-c-mode-hook ()
            (c-set-style
             (if (and (buffer-file-name)
                      (string-match "/usr/src/linux" (buffer-file-name)))
                 "linux"
               "free-group-style")))
          (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)
</pre>
     <p>In a programming team, a hook is a also a good place for each member
to put his own personal preferences.  For example, you might be the
only person in your team who likes Auto-newline minor mode.  You could
have it enabled by default by placing the following in your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:

     <pre class="example">          (defun my-turn-on-auto-newline ()
            (c-toggle-auto-newline 1))
          (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-turn-on-auto-newline)
</pre>
     </dl>
