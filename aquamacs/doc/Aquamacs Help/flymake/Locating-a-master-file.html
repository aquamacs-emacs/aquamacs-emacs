<h3 class="section">5.3 Locating a master file</h3>

<p><a name="index-Master-file-21"></a>
Master file is located in two steps.

   <p>First, a list of possible master files is built. A simple name
matching is used to find the files. For a C++ header <code>file.h</code>,
Flymake searches for all <code>.cpp</code> files in the directories whose relative paths are
stored in a customizable variable <code>flymake-master-file-dirs</code>, which
usually contains something like <code>("." "./src")</code>. No more than
<code>flymake-master-file-count-limit</code> entries is added to the master file
list. The list is then sorted to move files with names <code>file.cpp</code> to
the top.

   <p>Next, each master file in a list is checked to contain the appropriate
include directives. No more than <code>flymake-check-file-limit</code> of each
file are parsed.

   <p>For <code>file.h</code>, the include directives to look for are
<code>#include "file.h"</code>, <code>#include "../file.h"</code>, etc. Each
include is checked against a list of include directories
(see <a href="Getting-the-include-directories.html#Getting-the-include-directories">Getting the include directories</a>) to be sure it points to the
correct <code>file.h</code>.

   <p>First matching master file found stops the search. The master file is then
patched and saved to disk. In case no master file is found, syntax check is
aborted, and corresponding status (!) is reported in the mode line.
