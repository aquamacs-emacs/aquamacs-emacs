<p><a name="index-finding-members_002c-in-member-buffers-88"></a><a name="index-viewing-members_002c-in-member-buffers-89"></a><a name="index-member-definitions_002c-in-member-buffers-90"></a><a name="index-member-declarations_002c-in-member-buffers-91"></a><a name="index-definition-of-a-member_002c-in-member-buffers-92"></a><a name="index-declaration-of-a-member_002c-in-member-buffers-93"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>RET</kbd><dd>This command finds the definition of the member the cursor is on. 
Finding involves roughly the same as the standard Emacs tags facility
does&mdash;loading the file and searching for a regular expression matching
the member.

     <br><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>This command finds the declaration of the member the cursor is on.

     <br><dt><kbd>SPC</kbd><dd>This is the same command as <kbd>RET</kbd>, but views the member definition
instead of finding the member's source file.

     <br><dt><kbd>v</kbd><dd>This is the same command as <kbd>f</kbd>, but views the member's declaration
instead of finding the file the declaration is in. 
</dl>

   <p>You can install a hook function to perform actions after a member or
class declaration or definition has been found, or when it is not found.

   <p>All the commands described above can also be found in the context menu
displayed when clicking <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> on a member name.
