  <h4 class="subsection">12.11.2 Advising Named
  Functions</h4><a name="index-advising-named-functions" id=
  "index-advising-named-functions"></a>

  <p>A common use of advice is for named functions and macros. You
  could just use <code>add-function</code> as in:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(add-function :around (symbol-function '<var>fun</var>) #'his-tracing-function)
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>But you should use <code>advice-add</code> and
  <code>advice-remove</code> for that instead. This separate set of
  functions to manipulate pieces of advice applied to named
  functions, offers the following extra features compared to
  <code>add-function</code>: they know how to deal with macros and
  autoloaded functions, they let <code>describe-function</code>
  preserve the original docstring as well as document the added
  advice, and they let you add and remove advice before a function
  is even defined.</p>

  <p><code>advice-add</code> can be useful for altering the
  behavior of existing calls to an existing function without having
  to redefine the whole function. However, it can be a source of
  bugs, since existing callers to the function may assume the old
  behavior, and work incorrectly when the behavior is changed by
  advice. Advice can also cause confusion in debugging, if the
  person doing the debugging does not notice or remember that the
  function has been modified by advice.</p>

  <p>For these reasons, advice should be reserved for the cases
  where you cannot modify a function&rsquo;s behavior in any other
  way. If it is possible to do the same thing via a hook, that is
  preferable (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>). If you
  simply want to change what a particular key does, it may be
  better to write a new command, and remap the old command&rsquo;s
  key bindings to the new one (see <a href=
  "Remapping-Commands.html#Remapping-Commands">Remapping
  Commands</a>). In particular, Emacs&rsquo;s own source files
  should not put advice on functions in Emacs. (There are currently
  a few exceptions to this convention, but we aim to correct
  them.)</p>

  <p>Special forms (see <a href=
  "Special-Forms.html#Special-Forms">Special Forms</a>) cannot be
  advised, however macros can be advised, in much the same way as
  functions. Of course, this will not affect code that has already
  been macro-expanded, so you need to make sure the advice is
  installed before the macro is expanded.</p>

  <p>It is possible to advise a primitive (see <a href=
  "What-Is-a-Function.html#What-Is-a-Function">What Is a
  Function</a>), but one should typically <em>not</em> do so, for
  two reasons. Firstly, some primitives are used by the advice
  mechanism, and advising them could cause an infinite recursion.
  Secondly, many primitives are called directly from C, and such
  calls ignore advice; hence, one ends up in a confusing situation
  where some calls (occurring from Lisp code) obey the advice and
  other calls (from C code) do not.</p>

    <dd>
      <p>This macro defines a piece of advice and adds it to the
      function named <var>symbol</var>. The advice is an anonymous
      function if <var>name</var> is nil or a function named
      <code>symbol@name</code>. See <code>advice-add</code> for
      explanation of other arguments.</p>

    <dd>
      <p>Add the advice <var>function</var> to the named function
      <var>symbol</var>. <var>where</var> and <var>props</var> have
      the same meaning as for <code>add-function</code> (see

    <dd>
      <p>Remove the advice <var>function</var> from the named
      function <var>symbol</var>. <var>function</var> can also be
      the <code>name</code> of a piece of advice.</p>

      <p>Return non-<code>nil</code> if the advice
      <var>function</var> is already in the named function
      <var>symbol</var>. <var>function</var> can also be the
