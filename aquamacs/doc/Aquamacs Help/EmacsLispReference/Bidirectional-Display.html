  <p>Emacs can display text written in scripts, such as Arabic,
  Farsi, and Hebrew, whose natural ordering for horizontal text
  display runs from right to left. Furthermore, segments of Latin
  script and digits embedded in right-to-left text are displayed
  left-to-right, while segments of right-to-left script embedded in
  left-to-right text (e.g., Arabic or Hebrew text in comments or
  strings in a program source file) are appropriately displayed
  right-to-left. We call such mixtures of left-to-right and
  right-to-left text <em>bidirectional text</em>. This section
  describes the facilities and options for editing and displaying
  bidirectional text.</p><a name="index-logical-order" id=

  <p>Text is stored in Emacs buffers and strings in
  <em>logical</em> (or <em>reading</em>) order, i.e., the order in
  which a human would read each character. In right-to-left and
  bidirectional text, the order in which characters are displayed
  on the screen (called <em>visual order</em>) is not the same as
  logical order; the characters&rsquo; screen positions do not
  increase monotonically with string or buffer position. In
  performing this <em>bidirectional reordering</em>, Emacs follows
  the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (a.k.a.
  <acronym>UBA</acronym>), which is described in Annex #9 of the
  Unicode standard (<a href=
  "http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/</a>).
  Emacs provides a &ldquo;Full Bidirectionality&rdquo; class
  implementation of the <acronym>UBA</acronym>, consistent with the
  requirements of the Unicode Standard v8.0.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-bidi_002ddisplay_002dreordering" id=
    "index-bidi_002ddisplay_002dreordering"></a>Variable:
    <strong>bidi-display-reordering</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>If the value of this buffer-local variable is
      non-<code>nil</code> (the default), Emacs performs
      bidirectional reordering for display. The reordering affects
      buffer text, as well as display strings and overlay strings
      from text and overlay properties in the buffer (see <a href=
      "Overlay-Properties.html#Overlay-Properties">Overlay
      Properties</a>, and see <a href=
      "Display-Property.html#Display-Property">Display
      Property</a>). If the value is <code>nil</code>, Emacs does
      not perform bidirectional reordering in the buffer.</p>

      <p>The default value of <code>bidi-display-reordering</code>
      controls the reordering of strings which are not directly
      supplied by a buffer, including the text displayed in mode
      lines (see <a href=
      "Mode-Line-Format.html#Mode-Line-Format">Mode Line
      Format</a>) and header lines (see <a href=
      "Header-Lines.html#Header-Lines">Header Lines</a>).</p>
    </dd>
  </dl><a name="index-unibyte-buffers_002c-and-bidi-reordering" id=
  "index-unibyte-buffers_002c-and-bidi-reordering"></a>

  <p>Emacs never reorders the text of a unibyte buffer, even if
  <code>bidi-display-reordering</code> is non-<code>nil</code> in
  the buffer. This is because unibyte buffers contain raw bytes,
  not characters, and thus lack the directionality properties
  required for reordering. Therefore, to test whether text in a
  buffer will be reordered for display, it is not enough to test
  the value of <code>bidi-display-reordering</code> alone. The
  correct test is this:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
 (if (and enable-multibyte-characters
          bidi-display-reordering)
     ;; Buffer is being reordered for display
   )
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>However, unibyte display and overlay strings <em>are</em>
  reordered if their parent buffer is reordered. This is because
  plain-<small>ASCII</small> strings are stored by Emacs as unibyte
  strings. If a unibyte display or overlay string includes
  non-<small>ASCII</small> characters, these characters are assumed
  to have left-to-right direction.</p><a name=
  "index-display-properties_002c-and-bidi-reordering-of-text" id=
  "index-display-properties_002c-and-bidi-reordering-of-text"></a>

  <p>Text covered by <code>display</code> text properties, by
  overlays with <code>display</code> properties whose value is a
  string, and by any other properties that replace buffer text, is
  treated as a single unit when it is reordered for display. That
  is, the entire chunk of text covered by these properties is
  reordered together. Moreover, the bidirectional properties of the
  characters in such a chunk of text are ignored, and Emacs
  reorders them as if they were replaced with a single character
  <code>U+FFFC</code>, known as the <em>Object Replacement
  Character</em>. This means that placing a display property over a
  portion of text may change the way that the surrounding text is
  reordered for display. To prevent this unexpected effect, always
  place such properties on text whose directionality is identical
  with text that surrounds it.</p><a name=
  "index-base-direction-of-a-paragraph" id=
  "index-base-direction-of-a-paragraph"></a>

  <p>Each paragraph of bidirectional text has a <em>base
  direction</em>, either right-to-left or left-to-right.
  Left-to-right paragraphs are displayed beginning at the left
  margin of the window, and are truncated or continued when the
  text reaches the right margin. Right-to-left paragraphs are
  displayed beginning at the right margin, and are continued or
  truncated at the left margin.</p>

  <p>By default, Emacs determines the base direction of each
  paragraph by looking at the text at its beginning. The precise
  method of determining the base direction is specified by the
  <acronym>UBA</acronym>; in a nutshell, the first character in a
  paragraph that has an explicit directionality determines the base
  direction of the paragraph. However, sometimes a buffer may need
  to force a certain base direction for its paragraphs. For
  example, buffers containing program source code should force all
  paragraphs to be displayed left-to-right. You can use following
  variable to do this:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection" id=
    "index-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"></a>Variable:
    <strong>bidi-paragraph-direction</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>If the value of this buffer-local variable is the symbol
      <code>right-to-left</code> or <code>left-to-right</code>, all
      paragraphs in the buffer are assumed to have that specified
      direction. Any other value is equivalent to <code>nil</code>
      (the default), which means to determine the base direction of
      each paragraph from its contents.</p><a name=
      "index-prog_002dmode_002c-and-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"
      id=
      "index-prog_002dmode_002c-and-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"></a>

      <p>Modes for program source code should set this to
      <code>left-to-right</code>. Prog mode does this by default,
      so modes derived from Prog mode do not need to set this
      explicitly (see <a href=
      "Basic-Major-Modes.html#Basic-Major-Modes">Basic Major
      Modes</a>).</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name=
    "index-current_002dbidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection" id=
    "index-current_002dbidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"></a>Function:
    <strong>current-bidi-paragraph-direction</strong>
    <em>&amp;optional buffer</em></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This function returns the paragraph direction at point in
      the named <var>buffer</var>. The returned value is a symbol,
      either <code>left-to-right</code> or
      <code>right-to-left</code>. If <var>buffer</var> is omitted
      or <code>nil</code>, it defaults to the current buffer. If
      the buffer-local value of the variable
      <code>bidi-paragraph-direction</code> is
      non-<code>nil</code>, the returned value will be identical to
      that value; otherwise, the returned value reflects the
      paragraph direction determined dynamically by Emacs. For
      buffers whose value of <code>bidi-display-reordering</code>
      is <code>nil</code> as well as unibyte buffers, this function
      always returns <code>left-to-right</code>.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl><a name="index-visual_002dorder-cursor-motion" id=
  "index-visual_002dorder-cursor-motion"></a>

  <p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s a need to move point in strict visual
  order, either to the left or to the right of its current screen
  position. Emacs provides a primitive to do that.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-move_002dpoint_002dvisually" id=
    "index-move_002dpoint_002dvisually"></a>Function:
    <strong>move-point-visually</strong> <em>direction</em></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This function moves point of the currently selected window
      to the buffer position that appears immediately to the right
      or to the left of point on the screen. If
      <var>direction</var> is positive, point will move one screen
      position to the right, otherwise it will move one screen
      position to the left. Note that, depending on the surrounding
      bidirectional context, this could potentially move point many
      buffer positions away. If invoked at the end of a screen
      line, the function moves point to the rightmost or leftmost
      screen position of the next or previous screen line, as
      appropriate for the value of <var>direction</var>.</p>

      <p>The function returns the new buffer position as its
      value.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl><a name=

  <p>Bidirectional reordering can have surprising and unpleasant
  effects when two strings with bidirectional content are
  juxtaposed in a buffer, or otherwise programmatically
  concatenated into a string of text. A typical problematic case is
  when a buffer consists of sequences of text fields separated by
  whitespace or punctuation characters, like Buffer Menu mode or
  Rmail Summary Mode. Because the punctuation characters used as
  separators have <em>weak directionality</em>, they take on the
  directionality of surrounding text. As result, a numeric field
  that follows a field with bidirectional content can be displayed
  <em>to the left</em> of the preceding field, messing up the
  expected layout. There are several ways to avoid this
  problem:</p>

  <ul class="no-bullet">
    <li>&acirc;&circ;&rsquo; Append the special character
    <code>U+200E</code>, LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK, or
    <acronym>LRM</acronym>, to the end of each field that may have
    bidirectional content, or prepend it to the beginning of the
    following field. The function
    <code>bidi-string-mark-left-to-right</code>, described below,
    comes in handy for this purpose. (In a right-to-left paragraph,
    use <code>U+200F</code>, RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK, or
    <acronym>RLM</acronym>, instead.) This is one of the solutions
    recommended by the UBA.</li>

    <li>&acirc;&circ;&rsquo; Include the tab character in the field
    separator. The tab character plays the role of <em>segment
    separator</em> in bidirectional reordering, causing the text on
    either side to be reordered separately.</li>

    <li>&acirc;&circ;&rsquo; <a name=
    "index-space-display-spec_002c-and-bidirectional-text" id=
    "index-space-display-spec_002c-and-bidirectional-text"></a>
    Separate fields with a <code>display</code> property or overlay
    with a property value of the form <code>(space . PROPS)</code>
    (see <a href="Specified-Space.html#Specified-Space">Specified
    Space</a>). Emacs treats this display specification as a
    <em>paragraph separator</em>, and reorders the text on either
    side separately.</li>
  </ul>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name=
    "index-bidi_002dstring_002dmark_002dleft_002dto_002dright" id=
    "index-bidi_002dstring_002dmark_002dleft_002dto_002dright"></a>Function:
    <strong>bidi-string-mark-left-to-right</strong>
    <em>string</em></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This function returns its argument <var>string</var>,
      possibly modified, such that the result can be safely
      concatenated with another string, or juxtaposed with another
      string in a buffer, without disrupting the relative layout of
      this string and the next one on display. If the string
      returned by this function is displayed as part of a
      left-to-right paragraph, it will always appear on display to
      the left of the text that follows it. The function works by
      examining the characters of its argument, and if any of those
      characters could cause reordering on display, the function
      appends the <acronym>LRM</acronym> character to the string.
      The appended <acronym>LRM</acronym> character is made
      invisible by giving it an <code>invisible</code> text
      property of <code>t</code> (see <a href=
      "Invisible-Text.html#Invisible-Text">Invisible Text</a>).</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The reordering algorithm uses the bidirectional properties of
  the characters stored as their <code>bidi-class</code> property
  (see <a href=
  "Character-Properties.html#Character-Properties">Character
  Properties</a>). Lisp programs can change these properties by
  calling the <code>put-char-code-property</code> function.
  However, doing this requires a thorough understanding of the
  <acronym>UBA</acronym>, and is therefore not recommended. Any
  changes to the bidirectional properties of a character have
  global effect: they affect all Emacs frames and windows.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the <code>mirroring</code> property is used to
  display the appropriate mirrored character in the reordered text.
  Lisp programs can affect the mirrored display by changing this
  property. Again, any such changes affect all of Emacs
  display.</p><a name="index-overriding-bidirectional-properties"
  id="index-overriding-bidirectional-properties"></a> <a name=
  "index-directional-overrides" id=
  "index-directional-overrides"></a> <a name="index-LRO" id=
  "index-LRO"></a> <a name="index-RLO" id="index-RLO"></a>

  <p>The bidirectional properties of characters can be overridden
  by inserting into the text special directional control
  characters, LEFT-TO-RIGHT OVERRIDE (<acronym>LRO</acronym>) and
  RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE (<acronym>RLO</acronym>). Any characters
  between a <acronym>RLO</acronym> and the following newline or POP
  DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING (<acronym>PDF</acronym>) control
  character, whichever comes first, will be displayed as if they
  were strong right-to-left characters, i.e. they will be reversed
  on display. Similarly, any characters between
  <acronym>LRO</acronym> and <acronym>PDF</acronym> or newline will
  display as if they were strong left-to-right, and will
  <em>not</em> be reversed even if they are strong right-to-left
  characters.</p><a name=
  "index-phishing-using-directional-overrides" id=
  "index-phishing-using-directional-overrides"></a> <a name=
  "index-malicious-use-of-directional-overrides" id=
  "index-malicious-use-of-directional-overrides"></a>

  <p>These overrides are useful when you want to make some text
  unaffected by the reordering algorithm, and instead directly
  control the display order. But they can also be used for
  malicious purposes, known as <em>phishing</em>. Specifically, a
  URL on a Web page or a link in an email message can be
  manipulated to make its visual appearance unrecognizable, or
  similar to some popular benign location, while the real location,
  interpreted by a browser in the logical order, is very
  different.</p>

  <p>Emacs provides a primitive that applications can use to detect
  instances of text whose bidirectional properties were overridden
  so as to make a left-to-right character display as if it were a
  right-to-left character, or vise versa.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name=
    "index-bidi_002dfind_002doverridden_002ddirectionality" id=

    <strong>bidi-find-overridden-directionality</strong> <em>from
    to &amp;optional object</em></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This function looks at the text of the specified
      <var>object</var> between positions <var>from</var>
      (inclusive) and <var>to</var> (exclusive), and returns the
      first position where it finds a strong left-to-right
      character whose directional properties were forced to display
      the character as right-to-left, or for a strong right-to-left
      character that was forced to display as left-to-right. If it
      finds no such characters in the specified region of text, it
      returns <code>nil</code>.</p>

      <p>The optional argument <var>object</var> specifies which
      text to search, and defaults to the current buffer. If
      <var>object</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it can be some
      other buffer, or it can be a string or a window. If it is a
      string, the function searches that string. If it is a window,
      the function searches the buffer displayed in that window. If
      a buffer whose text you want to examine is displayed in some
      window, we recommend to specify it by that window, rather
      than pass the buffer to the function. This is because telling
      the function about the window allows it to correctly account
      for window-specific overlays, which might change the result
      of the function if some text in the buffer is covered by
      overlays.</p>

  <p>When text that includes mixed right-to-left and left-to-right
  characters and bidirectional controls is copied into a different
  location, it can change its visual appearance, and also can
  affect the visual appearance of the surrounding text at
  destination. This is because reordering of bidirectional text
  specified by the <acronym>UBA</acronym> has non-trivial
  context-dependent effects both on the copied text and on the text
  at copy destination that will surround it.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, a Lisp program may need to preserve the exact
  visual appearance of the copied text at destination, and of the
  text that surrounds the copy. Lisp programs can use the following
  function to achieve that effect.</p>

      visual appearance of the text when it is inserted at another
      place. Optional argument <var>no-properties</var>, if
      non-<code>nil</code>, means remove the text properties from
      the copy of the text.</p>
