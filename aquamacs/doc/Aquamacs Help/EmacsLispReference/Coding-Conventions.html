  <h3 class="section">D.1 Emacs Lisp Coding
  Conventions</h3><a name="index-coding-conventions-in-Emacs-Lisp"
  id="index-coding-conventions-in-Emacs-Lisp"></a>

  <p>Here are conventions that you should follow when writing Emacs
  Lisp code intended for widespread use:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Simply loading a package should not change Emacs&rsquo;s
    editing behavior. Include a command or commands to enable and
    disable the feature, or to invoke it.

      <p>This convention is mandatory for any file that includes
      custom definitions. If fixing such a file to follow this
      convention requires an incompatible change, go ahead and make
      the incompatible change; don&rsquo;t postpone it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>You should choose a short word to distinguish your program
    from other Lisp programs. The names of all global symbols in
    your program, that is the names of variables, constants, and
    functions, should begin with that chosen prefix. Separate the
    prefix from the rest of the name with a hyphen,
    &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo;. This practice helps avoid name
    conflicts, since all global variables in Emacs Lisp share the
    same name space, and all functions share another name
    space<a name="DOCF21" href="#FOOT21" id=
    "DOCF21"><sup>21</sup></a>. Use two hyphens to separate prefix
    and name if the symbol is not meant to be used by other
    packages.

      <p>Occasionally, for a command name intended for users to
      use, it is more convenient if some words come before the
      package&rsquo;s name prefix. And constructs that define
      functions, variables, etc., work better if they start with
      &lsquo;<samp>defun</samp>&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;<samp>defvar</samp>&rsquo;, so put the name prefix
      later on in the name.</p>

      <p>This recommendation applies even to names for traditional
      Lisp primitives that are not primitives in Emacs
      Lisp&mdash;such as <code>copy-list</code>. Believe it or not,
      there is more than one plausible way to define
      <code>copy-list</code>. Play it safe; append your name prefix
      to produce a name like <code>foo-copy-list</code> or
      <code>mylib-copy-list</code> instead.</p>

      <p>If you write a function that you think ought to be added
      to Emacs under a certain name, such as
      <code>twiddle-files</code>, don&rsquo;t call it by that name
      in your program. Call it <code>mylib-twiddle-files</code> in
      your program, and send mail to
      &lsquo;<samp>bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org</samp>&rsquo; suggesting
      we add it to Emacs. If and when we do, we can change the name
      easily enough.</p>

      <p>If one prefix is insufficient, your package can use two or
      three alternative common prefixes, so long as they make
      sense.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Put a call to <code>provide</code> at the end of each
    separate Lisp file. See <a href=
    "Named-Features.html#Named-Features">Named Features</a>.</li>

    <li>If a file requires certain other Lisp programs to be loaded
    beforehand, then the comments at the beginning of the file
    should say so. Also, use <code>require</code> to make sure they
    are loaded. See <a href=
    "Named-Features.html#Named-Features">Named Features</a>.</li>

    <li>If a file <var>foo</var> uses a macro defined in another
    file <var>bar</var>, but does not use any functions or
    variables defined in <var>bar</var>, then <var>foo</var> should
    contain the following expression:

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
(eval-when-compile (require '<var>bar</var>))
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This tells Emacs to load <var>bar</var> just before
      byte-compiling <var>foo</var>, so that the macro definition
      is available during compilation. Using
      <code>eval-when-compile</code> avoids loading <var>bar</var>
      when the compiled version of <var>foo</var> is <em>used</em>.
      It should be called before the first use of the macro in the
      file. See <a href=
      "Compiling-Macros.html#Compiling-Macros">Compiling
      Macros</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Avoid loading additional libraries at run time unless they
    are really needed. If your file simply cannot work without some
    other library, then just <code>require</code> that library at
    the top-level and be done with it. But if your file contains
    several independent features, and only one or two require the
    extra library, then consider putting <code>require</code>
    statements inside the relevant functions rather than at the
    top-level. Or use <code>autoload</code> statements to load the
    extra library when needed. This way people who don&rsquo;t use
    those aspects of your file do not need to load the extra
    library.</li>

    <li>If you need Common Lisp extensions, use the
    <code>cl-lib</code> library rather than the old <code>cl</code>
    library. The latter does not use a clean namespace (i.e., its
    definitions do not start with a &lsquo;<samp>cl-</samp>&rsquo;
    prefix). If your package loads <code>cl</code> at run time,
    that could cause name clashes for users who don&rsquo;t use
    that package.

      <p>There is no problem with using the <code>cl</code> package
      at <em>compile</em> time, with <code>(eval-when-compile
      (require 'cl))</code>. That&rsquo;s sufficient for using the
      macros in the <code>cl</code> package, because the compiler
      expands them before generating the byte-code. It is still
      better to use the more modern <code>cl-lib</code> in this
      case, though.</p>
    </li>

    <li>When defining a major mode, please follow the major mode
    conventions. See <a href=
    "Major-Mode-Conventions.html#Major-Mode-Conventions">Major Mode
    Conventions</a>.</li>

    <li>When defining a minor mode, please follow the minor mode
    conventions. See <a href=
    "Minor-Mode-Conventions.html#Minor-Mode-Conventions">Minor Mode
    Conventions</a>.</li>

    <li>If the purpose of a function is to tell you whether a
    certain condition is true or false, give the function a name
    that ends in &lsquo;<samp>p</samp>&rsquo; (which stands for
    &ldquo;predicate&rdquo;). If the name is one word, add just
    &lsquo;<samp>p</samp>&rsquo;; if the name is multiple words,
    add &lsquo;<samp>-p</samp>&rsquo;. Examples are
    <code>framep</code> and <code>frame-live-p</code>.</li>

    <li>If the purpose of a variable is to store a single function,
    give it a name that ends in
    &lsquo;<samp>-function</samp>&rsquo;. If the purpose of a
    variable is to store a list of functions (i.e., the variable is
    a hook), please follow the naming conventions for hooks. See
    <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.</li>

    <li><a name="index-unloading-packages_002c-preparing-for" id=
    "index-unloading-packages_002c-preparing-for"></a> If loading
    the file adds functions to hooks, define a function
    <code><var>feature</var>-unload-hook</code>, where
    <var>feature</var> is the name of the feature the package
    provides, and make it undo any such changes. Using
    <code>unload-feature</code> to unload the file will run this
    function. See <a href=
    "Unloading.html#Unloading">Unloading</a>.</li>

    <li>It is a bad idea to define aliases for the Emacs
    primitives. Normally you should use the standard names instead.
    The case where an alias may be useful is where it facilitates
    backwards compatibility or portability.</li>

    <li>If a package needs to define an alias or a new function for
    compatibility with some other version of Emacs, name it with
    the package prefix, not with the raw name with which it occurs
    in the other version. Here is an example from Gnus, which
    provides many examples of such compatibility issues.

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
(defalias 'gnus-point-at-bol
  (if (fboundp 'point-at-bol)
      'point-at-bol
    'line-beginning-position))
</pre>
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>Redefining or advising an Emacs primitive is a bad idea. It
    may do the right thing for a particular program, but there is
    no telling what other programs might break as a result.</li>

    <li>It is likewise a bad idea for one Lisp package to advise a
    function in another Lisp package (see <a href=
    "Advising-Functions.html#Advising-Functions">Advising
    Functions</a>).</li>

    <li>Avoid using <code>eval-after-load</code> and
    <code>with-eval-after-load</code> in libraries and packages
    (see <a href="Hooks-for-Loading.html#Hooks-for-Loading">Hooks
    for Loading</a>). This feature is meant for personal
    customizations; using it in a Lisp program is unclean, because
    it modifies the behavior of another Lisp file in a way
    that&rsquo;s not visible in that file. This is an obstacle for
    debugging, much like advising a function in the other
    package.</li>

    <li>If a file does replace any of the standard functions or
    library programs of Emacs, prominent comments at the beginning
    of the file should say which functions are replaced, and how
    the behavior of the replacements differs from that of the
    originals.</li>

    <li>Constructs that define a function or variable should be
    macros, not functions, and their names should start with
    &lsquo;<samp>define-</samp>&rsquo;. The macro should receive
    the name to be defined as the first argument. That will help
    various tools find the definition automatically. Avoid
    constructing the names in the macro itself, since that would
    confuse these tools.</li>

    <li>In some other systems there is a convention of choosing
    variable names that begin and end with
    &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo;. We don&rsquo;t use that
    convention in Emacs Lisp, so please don&rsquo;t use it in your
    programs. (Emacs uses such names only for special-purpose
    buffers.) People will find Emacs more coherent if all libraries
    use the same conventions.</li>

    <li>The default file coding system for Emacs Lisp source files
    is UTF-8 (see <a href=
    "Text-Representations.html#Text-Representations">Text
    Representations</a>). In the rare event that your program
    contains characters which are <em>not</em> in UTF-8, you should
    specify an appropriate coding system in the source file&rsquo;s
    &lsquo;<samp>-*-</samp>&rsquo; line or local variables list.
    See <a href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">
    Local Variables in Files</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs
    Manual</cite>.</li>

    <li>Indent the file using the default indentation
    parameters.</li>

    <li>Don&rsquo;t make a habit of putting close-parentheses on
    lines by themselves; Lisp programmers find this
    disconcerting.</li>

    <li>Please put a copyright notice and copying permission notice
    on the file if you distribute copies. See <a href=
    "Library-Headers.html#Library-Headers">Library
    Headers</a>.</li>
