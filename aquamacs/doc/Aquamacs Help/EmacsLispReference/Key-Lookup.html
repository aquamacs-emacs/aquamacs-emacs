  "index-keymap-entry" id="index-keymap-entry"></a>

  <p><em>Key lookup</em> is the process of finding the binding of a
  key sequence from a given keymap. The execution or use of the
  binding is not part of key lookup.</p>

  <p>Key lookup uses just the event type of each event in the key
  sequence; the rest of the event is ignored. In fact, a key
  sequence used for key lookup may designate a mouse event with
  just its types (a symbol) instead of the entire event (a list).
  See <a href="Input-Events.html#Input-Events">Input Events</a>.
  Such a key sequence is insufficient for
  <code>command-execute</code> to run, but it is sufficient for
  looking up or rebinding a key.</p>

  <p>When the key sequence consists of multiple events, key lookup
  processes the events sequentially: the binding of the first event
  is found, and must be a keymap; then the second event&rsquo;s
  binding is found in that keymap, and so on until all the events
  in the key sequence are used up. (The binding thus found for the
  last event may or may not be a keymap.) Thus, the process of key
  lookup is defined in terms of a simpler process for looking up a
  single event in a keymap. How that is done depends on the type of
  object associated with the event in that keymap.</p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s use the term <em>keymap entry</em> to describe the
  value found by looking up an event type in a keymap. (This
  doesn&rsquo;t include the item string and other extra elements in
  a keymap element for a menu item, because <code>lookup-key</code>
  and other key lookup functions don&rsquo;t include them in the
  returned value.) While any Lisp object may be stored in a keymap
  as a keymap entry, not all make sense for key lookup. Here is a
  table of the meaningful types of keymap entries:</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt><code>nil</code></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-nil-in-keymap" id="index-nil-in-keymap"></a>

      <p><code>nil</code> means that the events used so far in the
      lookup form an undefined key. When a keymap fails to mention
      an event type at all, and has no default binding, that is
      equivalent to a binding of <code>nil</code> for that event
      type.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><var>command</var></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-command-in-keymap" id=
      "index-command-in-keymap"></a>

      <p>The events used so far in the lookup form a complete key,
      and <var>command</var> is its binding. See <a href=
      "What-Is-a-Function.html#What-Is-a-Function">What Is a
      Function</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><var>array</var></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-string-in-keymap" id=
      "index-string-in-keymap"></a>

      <p>The array (either a string or a vector) is a keyboard
      macro. The events used so far in the lookup form a complete
      key, and the array is its binding. See <a href=
      "Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>,
      for more information.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><var>keymap</var></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-keymap-in-keymap" id=
      "index-keymap-in-keymap"></a>

      <p>The events used so far in the lookup form a prefix key.
      The next event of the key sequence is looked up in
      <var>keymap</var>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><var>list</var></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-list-in-keymap" id="index-list-in-keymap"></a>

      <p>The meaning of a list depends on what it contains:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the <small>CAR</small> of <var>list</var> is the
        symbol <code>keymap</code>, then the list is a keymap, and
        is treated as a keymap (see above).</li>

        <li><a name="index-lambda-in-keymap" id=
        "index-lambda-in-keymap"></a> If the <small>CAR</small> of
        <var>list</var> is <code>lambda</code>, then the list is a
        lambda expression. This is presumed to be a function, and
        is treated as such (see above). In order to execute
        properly as a key binding, this function must be a
        command&mdash;it must have an <code>interactive</code>
        specification. See <a href=
        "Defining-Commands.html#Defining-Commands">Defining
        Commands</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt><var>symbol</var></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-symbol-in-keymap" id=
      "index-symbol-in-keymap"></a>

      <p>The function definition of <var>symbol</var> is used in
      place of <var>symbol</var>. If that too is a symbol, then
      this process is repeated, any number of times. Ultimately
      this should lead to an object that is a keymap, a command, or
      a keyboard macro.</p>

      <p>Note that keymaps and keyboard macros (strings and
      vectors) are not valid functions, so a symbol with a keymap,
      string, or vector as its function definition is invalid as a
      function. It is, however, valid as a key binding. If the
      definition is a keyboard macro, then the symbol is also valid
      as an argument to <code>command-execute</code> (see <a href=
      "Interactive-Call.html#Interactive-Call">Interactive
      Call</a>).</p><a name="index-undefined-in-keymap" id=
      "index-undefined-in-keymap"></a>

      <p>The symbol <code>undefined</code> is worth special
      mention: it means to treat the key as undefined. Strictly
      speaking, the key is defined, and its binding is the command
      <code>undefined</code>; but that command does the same thing
      that is done automatically for an undefined key: it rings the
      bell (by calling <code>ding</code>) but does not signal an
      error.</p><a name="index-preventing-prefix-key" id=
      "index-preventing-prefix-key"></a>

      <p><code>undefined</code> is used in local keymaps to
      override a global key binding and make the key undefined
      locally. A local binding of <code>nil</code> would fail to do
      this because it would not override the global binding.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><var>anything else</var></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>If any other type of object is found, the events used so
      far in the lookup form a complete key, and the object is its
      binding, but the binding is not executable as a command.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>In short, a keymap entry may be a keymap, a command, a
  keyboard macro, a symbol that leads to one of them, or
  <code>nil</code>.</p>
