<a name="Introduction-to-Minibuffers"></a>
<h3 class="section">19.1 Introduction to Minibuffers</h3>

<p>In most ways, a minibuffer is a normal Emacs buffer.  Most operations
<em>within</em> a buffer, such as editing commands, work normally in a
minibuffer.  However, many operations for managing buffers do not apply
to minibuffers.  The name of a minibuffer always has the form &lsquo;<samp>&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">*Minibuf-</span><var>number</var>*</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->, and it cannot be changed.  Minibuffers are
displayed only in special windows used only for minibuffers; these
windows always appear at the bottom of a frame.  (Sometimes frames have
no minibuffer window, and sometimes a special kind of frame contains
nothing but a minibuffer window; see <a href="Minibuffers-and-Frames.html#Minibuffers-and-Frames">Minibuffers and Frames</a>.)
</p>
<p>The text in the minibuffer always starts with the <em>prompt string</em>,
the text that was specified by the program that is using the minibuffer
to tell the user what sort of input to type.  This text is marked
read-only so you won&rsquo;t accidentally delete or change it.  It is also
marked as a field (see <a href="Fields.html#Fields">Fields</a>), so that certain motion functions,
including <code>beginning-of-line</code>, <code>forward-word</code>,
<code>forward-sentence</code>, and <code>forward-paragraph</code>, stop at the
boundary between the prompt and the actual text.
</p>
<p>The minibuffer&rsquo;s window is normally a single line; it grows
automatically if the contents require more space.  Whilst it is
active, you can explicitly resize it temporarily with the window
sizing commands; it reverts to its normal size when the minibuffer is
exited.  When the minibuffer is not active, you can resize it
permanently by using the window sizing commands in the frame&rsquo;s other
window, or dragging the mode line with the mouse.  (Due to details of
the current implementation, for this to work <code>resize-mini-windows</code>
must be <code>nil</code>.)  If the frame contains just a minibuffer, you can
change the minibuffer&rsquo;s size by changing the frame&rsquo;s size.
</p>
<p>Use of the minibuffer reads input events, and that alters the values
of variables such as <code>this-command</code> and <code>last-command</code>
(see <a href="Command-Loop-Info.html#Command-Loop-Info">Command Loop Info</a>).  Your program should bind them around the
code that uses the minibuffer, if you do not want that to change them.
</p>
<p>Under some circumstances, a command can use a minibuffer even if
there is an active minibuffer; such a minibuffer is called a
<em>recursive minibuffer</em>.  The first minibuffer is named
&lsquo;<samp>&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">*Minibuf-1*</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  Recursive minibuffers are named by
incrementing the number at the end of the name.  (The names begin with
a space so that they won&rsquo;t show up in normal buffer lists.)  Of
several recursive minibuffers, the innermost (or most recently
entered) is the active minibuffer.  We usually call this <em>the</em>
minibuffer.  You can permit or forbid recursive minibuffers by setting
the variable <code>enable-recursive-minibuffers</code>, or by putting
properties of that name on command symbols (See <a href="Recursive-Mini.html#Recursive-Mini">Recursive Mini</a>.)
</p>
<p>Like other buffers, a minibuffer uses a local keymap
(see <a href="Keymaps.html#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>) to specify special key bindings.  The function that
invokes the minibuffer also sets up its local map according to the job
to be done.  See <a href="Text-from-Minibuffer.html#Text-from-Minibuffer">Text from Minibuffer</a>, for the non-completion
minibuffer local maps.  See <a href="Completion-Commands.html#Completion-Commands">Completion Commands</a>, for the minibuffer
local maps for completion.
</p>
<a name="index-inactive-minibuffer"></a>
<p>When a minibuffer is inactive, its major mode is
<code>minibuffer-inactive-mode</code>, with keymap
<code>minibuffer-inactive-mode-map</code>.  This is only really useful if
the minibuffer is in a separate frame.  See <a href="Minibuffers-and-Frames.html#Minibuffers-and-Frames">Minibuffers and Frames</a>.
</p>
<p>When Emacs is running in batch mode, any request to read from the
minibuffer actually reads a line from the standard input descriptor that
was supplied when Emacs was started.  This supports only basic input:
none of the special minibuffer features (history, completion, etc.)
are available in batch mode.
