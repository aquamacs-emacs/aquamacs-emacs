  <h3 class="section">24.2 Saving Buffers</h3><a name=
  "index-saving-buffers" id="index-saving-buffers"></a>

  <p>When you edit a file in Emacs, you are actually working on a
  buffer that is visiting that file&mdash;that is, the contents of
  the file are copied into the buffer and the copy is what you
  edit. Changes to the buffer do not change the file until you
  <em>save</em> the buffer, which means copying the contents of the
  buffer into the file.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-save_002dbuffer" id=
    "index-save_002dbuffer"></a>Command:
    <strong>save-buffer</strong> <em>&amp;optional
    backup-option</em></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This function saves the contents of the current buffer in
      its visited file if the buffer has been modified since it was
      last visited or saved. Otherwise it does nothing.</p>

      <p><code>save-buffer</code> is responsible for making backup
      files. Normally, <var>backup-option</var> is
      <code>nil</code>, and <code>save-buffer</code> makes a backup
      file only if this is the first save since visiting the file.
      Other values for <var>backup-option</var> request the making
      of backup files in other circumstances:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>With an argument of 4 or 64, reflecting 1 or 3
        <kbd>C-u</kbd>&rsquo;s, the <code>save-buffer</code>
        function marks this version of the file to be backed up
        when the buffer is next saved.</li>

        <li>With an argument of 16 or 64, reflecting 2 or 3
        <kbd>C-u</kbd>&rsquo;s, the <code>save-buffer</code>
        function unconditionally backs up the previous version of
        the file before saving it.</li>

        <li>With an argument of 0, unconditionally do <em>not</em>
        make any backup file.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-save_002dsome_002dbuffers" id=
    "index-save_002dsome_002dbuffers"></a>Command:
    <strong>save-some-buffers</strong> <em>&amp;optional
    save-silently-p pred</em></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="Definition-of-save_002dsome_002dbuffers" id=
      "Definition-of-save_002dsome_002dbuffers"></a>

      <p>This command saves some modified file-visiting buffers.
      Normally it asks the user about each buffer. But if
      <var>save-silently-p</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it saves
      all the file-visiting buffers without querying the user.</p>

      <p>The optional <var>pred</var> argument controls which
      buffers to ask about (or to save silently if
      <var>save-silently-p</var> is non-<code>nil</code>). If it is
      <code>nil</code>, that means to ask only about file-visiting
      buffers. If it is <code>t</code>, that means also offer to
      save certain other non-file buffers&mdash;those that have a
      non-<code>nil</code> buffer-local value of
      <code>buffer-offer-save</code> (see <a href=
      "Killing-Buffers.html#Killing-Buffers">Killing Buffers</a>).
      A user who says &lsquo;<samp>yes</samp>&rsquo; to saving a
      non-file buffer is asked to specify the file name to use. The
      <code>save-buffers-kill-emacs</code> function passes the
      value <code>t</code> for <var>pred</var>.</p>

      <p>If <var>pred</var> is neither <code>t</code> nor
      <code>nil</code>, then it should be a function of no
      arguments. It will be called in each buffer to decide whether
      to offer to save that buffer. If it returns a
      non-<code>nil</code> value in a certain buffer, that means do
      offer to save that buffer.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-write_002dfile" id=
    "index-write_002dfile"></a>Command: <strong>write-file</strong>
    <em>filename &amp;optional confirm</em></dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="Definition-of-write_002dfile" id=
      "Definition-of-write_002dfile"></a>

      <p>This function writes the current buffer into file
      <var>filename</var>, makes the buffer visit that file, and
      marks it not modified. Then it renames the buffer based on
      <var>filename</var>, appending a string like
      &lsquo;<samp>&lt;2&gt;</samp>&rsquo; if necessary to make a
      unique buffer name. It does most of this work by calling
      <code>set-visited-file-name</code> (see <a href=
      "Buffer-File-Name.html#Buffer-File-Name">Buffer File
      Name</a>) and <code>save-buffer</code>.</p>

      <p>If <var>confirm</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, that means
      to ask for confirmation before overwriting an existing file.
      Interactively, confirmation is required, unless the user
      supplies a prefix argument.</p>

      <p>If <var>filename</var> is an existing directory, or a
      symbolic link to one, <code>write-file</code> uses the name
      of the visited file, in directory <var>filename</var>. If the
      buffer is not visiting a file, it uses the buffer name
      instead.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Saving a buffer runs several hooks. It also performs format
  conversion (see <a href=
  "Format-Conversion.html#Format-Conversion">Format
  Conversion</a>).</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-write_002dfile_002dfunctions" id=
    "index-write_002dfile_002dfunctions"></a>Variable:
    <strong>write-file-functions</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The value of this variable is a list of functions to be
      called before writing out a buffer to its visited file. If
      one of them returns non-<code>nil</code>, the file is
      considered already written and the rest of the functions are
      not called, nor is the usual code for writing the file
      executed.</p>

      <p>If a function in <code>write-file-functions</code> returns
      non-<code>nil</code>, it is responsible for making a backup
      file (if that is appropriate). To do so, execute the
      following code:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
(or buffer-backed-up (backup-buffer))
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>You might wish to save the file modes value returned by
      <code>backup-buffer</code> and use that (if
      non-<code>nil</code>) to set the mode bits of the file that
      you write. This is what <code>save-buffer</code> normally
      does. See <a href="Making-Backups.html#Making-Backups">Making
      Backup Files</a>.</p>

      <p>The hook functions in <code>write-file-functions</code>
      are also responsible for encoding the data (if desired): they
      must choose a suitable coding system and end-of-line
      conversion (see <a href=
      "Lisp-and-Coding-Systems.html#Lisp-and-Coding-Systems">Lisp
      and Coding Systems</a>), perform the encoding (see <a href=
      "Explicit-Encoding.html#Explicit-Encoding">Explicit
      Encoding</a>), and set <code>last-coding-system-used</code>
      to the coding system that was used (see <a href=
      "Encoding-and-I_002fO.html#Encoding-and-I_002fO">Encoding and
      I/O</a>).</p>

      <p>If you set this hook locally in a buffer, it is assumed to
      be associated with the file or the way the contents of the
      buffer were obtained. Thus the variable is marked as a
      permanent local, so that changing the major mode does not
      alter a buffer-local value. On the other hand, calling
      <code>set-visited-file-name</code> will reset it. If this is
      not what you want, you might like to use
      <code>write-contents-functions</code> instead.</p>

      <p>Even though this is not a normal hook, you can use
      <code>add-hook</code> and <code>remove-hook</code> to
      manipulate the list. See <a href=
      "Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-write_002dcontents_002dfunctions" id=
    "index-write_002dcontents_002dfunctions"></a>Variable:
    <strong>write-contents-functions</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This works just like <code>write-file-functions</code>,
      but it is intended for hooks that pertain to the
      buffer&rsquo;s contents, not to the particular visited file
      or its location. Such hooks are usually set up by major
      modes, as buffer-local bindings for this variable. This
      variable automatically becomes buffer-local whenever it is
      set; switching to a new major mode always resets this
      variable, but calling <code>set-visited-file-name</code> does
      not.</p>

      <p>If any of the functions in this hook returns
      non-<code>nil</code>, the file is considered already written
      and the rest are not called and neither are the functions in
      <code>write-file-functions</code>.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-before_002dsave_002dhook" id=
    "index-before_002dsave_002dhook"></a>User Option:
    <strong>before-save-hook</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This normal hook runs before a buffer is saved in its
      visited file, regardless of whether that is done normally or
      by one of the hooks described above. For instance, the
      <samp>copyright.el</samp> program uses this hook to make sure
      the file you are saving has the current year in its copyright
      notice.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-after_002dsave_002dhook" id=
    "index-after_002dsave_002dhook"></a>User Option:
    <strong>after-save-hook</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This normal hook runs after a buffer has been saved in its
      visited file. One use of this hook is in Fast Lock mode; it
      uses this hook to save the highlighting information in a
      cache file.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-file_002dprecious_002dflag" id=
    "index-file_002dprecious_002dflag"></a>User Option:
    <strong>file-precious-flag</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, then
      <code>save-buffer</code> protects against I/O errors while
      saving by writing the new file to a temporary name instead of
      the name it is supposed to have, and then renaming it to the
      intended name after it is clear there are no errors. This
      procedure prevents problems such as a lack of disk space from
      resulting in an invalid file.</p>

      <p>As a side effect, backups are necessarily made by copying.
      See <a href="Rename-or-Copy.html#Rename-or-Copy">Rename or
      Copy</a>. Yet, at the same time, saving a precious file
      always breaks all hard links between the file you save and
      other file names.</p>

      <p>Some modes give this variable a non-<code>nil</code>
      buffer-local value in particular buffers.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="index-require_002dfinal_002dnewline" id=
    "index-require_002dfinal_002dnewline"></a>User Option:
    <strong>require-final-newline</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This variable determines whether files may be written out
      that do <em>not</em> end with a newline. If the value of the
      variable is <code>t</code>, then <code>save-buffer</code>
      silently adds a newline at the end of the buffer whenever it
      does not already end in one. If the value is
      <code>visit</code>, Emacs adds a missing newline just after
      it visits the file. If the value is <code>visit-save</code>,
      Emacs adds a missing newline both on visiting and on saving.
      For any other non-<code>nil</code> value,
      <code>save-buffer</code> asks the user whether to add a
      newline each time the case arises.</p>

      <p>If the value of the variable is <code>nil</code>, then
      <code>save-buffer</code> doesn&rsquo;t add newlines at all.
      <code>nil</code> is the default value, but a few major modes
      set it to <code>t</code> in particular buffers.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>See also the function <code>set-visited-file-name</code> (see
  <a href="Buffer-File-Name.html#Buffer-File-Name">Buffer File
  Name</a>).</p>
