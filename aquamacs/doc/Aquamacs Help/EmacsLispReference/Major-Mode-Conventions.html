  "index-major-mode-conventions"></a> <a name=
  "index-conventions-for-writing-major-modes" id=
  "index-conventions-for-writing-major-modes"></a>

  <p>The code for every major mode should follow various coding
  conventions, including conventions for local keymap and syntax
  table initialization, function and variable names, and hooks.</p>

  <p>If you use the <code>define-derived-mode</code> macro, it will
  take care of many of these conventions automatically. See
  <a href="Derived-Modes.html#Derived-Modes">Derived Modes</a>.
  Note also that Fundamental mode is an exception to many of these
  conventions, because it represents the default state of
  Emacs.</p>

  <p>The following list of conventions is only partial. Each major
  mode should aim for consistency in general with other Emacs major
  modes, as this makes Emacs as a whole more coherent. It is
  impossible to list here all the possible points where this issue
  might come up; if the Emacs developers point out an area where
  your major mode deviates from the usual conventions, please make
  it compatible.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Define a major mode command whose name ends in
    &lsquo;<samp>-mode</samp>&rsquo;. When called with no
    arguments, this command should switch to the new mode in the
    current buffer by setting up the keymap, syntax table, and
    buffer-local variables in an existing buffer. It should not
    change the buffer&rsquo;s contents.</li>

    <li>Write a documentation string for this command that
    describes the special commands available in this mode. See
    <a href="Mode-Help.html#Mode-Help">Mode Help</a>.

      <p>The documentation string may include the special
      documentation substrings,
      &lsquo;<samp>\[<var>command</var>]</samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp>\{<var>keymap</var>}</samp>&rsquo;, and
      &lsquo;<samp>\&lt;<var>keymap</var>&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, which
      allow the help display to adapt automatically to the
      user&rsquo;s own key bindings. See <a href=
      "Keys-in-Documentation.html#Keys-in-Documentation">Keys in
      Documentation</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The major mode command should start by calling
    <code>kill-all-local-variables</code>. This runs the normal
    hook <code>change-major-mode-hook</code>, then gets rid of the
    buffer-local variables of the major mode previously in effect.
    See <a href=
    "Creating-Buffer_002dLocal.html#Creating-Buffer_002dLocal">Creating
    Buffer-Local</a>.</li>

    <li>The major mode command should set the variable
    <code>major-mode</code> to the major mode command symbol. This
    is how <code>describe-mode</code> discovers which documentation
    to print.</li>

    <li>The major mode command should set the variable
    <code>mode-name</code> to the &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; name of the
    mode, usually a string (but see <a href=
    "Mode-Line-Data.html#Mode-Line-Data">Mode Line Data</a>, for
    other possible forms). The name of the mode appears in the mode
    line.</li>

    <li><a name="index-functions-in-modes" id=
    "index-functions-in-modes"></a> Since all global names are in
    the same name space, all the global variables, constants, and
    functions that are part of the mode should have names that
    start with the major mode name (or with an abbreviation of it
    if the name is long). See <a href=
    "Coding-Conventions.html#Coding-Conventions">Coding
    Conventions</a>.</li>

    <li>In a major mode for editing some kind of structured text,
    such as a programming language, indentation of text according
    to structure is probably useful. So the mode should set
    <code>indent-line-function</code> to a suitable function, and
    probably customize other variables for indentation. See
    <a href="Auto_002dIndentation.html#Auto_002dIndentation">Auto-Indentation</a>.</li>

    <li>
      <a name="index-keymaps-in-modes" id=
      "index-keymaps-in-modes"></a> The major mode should usually
      have its own keymap, which is used as the local keymap in all
      buffers in that mode. The major mode command should call
      <code>use-local-map</code> to install this local map. See
      <a href="Active-Keymaps.html#Active-Keymaps">Active
      Keymaps</a>, for more information.

      <p>This keymap should be stored permanently in a global
      variable named <code><var>modename</var>-mode-map</code>.
      Normally the library that defines the mode sets this
      variable.</p>

      <p>See <a href=
      "Tips-for-Defining.html#Tips-for-Defining">Tips for
      Defining</a>, for advice about how to write the code to set
      up the mode&rsquo;s keymap variable.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The key sequences bound in a major mode keymap should
    usually start with <kbd>C-c</kbd>, followed by a control
    character, a digit, or <kbd>{</kbd>, <kbd>}</kbd>,
    <kbd>&lt;</kbd>, <kbd>&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>:</kbd> or <kbd>;</kbd>.
    The other punctuation characters are reserved for minor modes,
    and ordinary letters are reserved for users.

      <p>A major mode can also rebind the keys <kbd>M-n</kbd>,
      <kbd>M-p</kbd> and <kbd>M-s</kbd>. The bindings for
      <kbd>M-n</kbd> and <kbd>M-p</kbd> should normally be some
      kind of moving forward and backward, but this does not
      necessarily mean cursor motion.</p>

      <p>It is legitimate for a major mode to rebind a standard key
      sequence if it provides a command that does the same job in a
      way better suited to the text this mode is used for. For
      example, a major mode for editing a programming language
      might redefine <kbd>C-M-a</kbd> to move to the beginning of a
      function in a way that works better for that language.</p>

      <p>It is also legitimate for a major mode to rebind a
      standard key sequence whose standard meaning is rarely useful
      in that mode. For instance, minibuffer modes rebind
      <kbd>M-r</kbd>, whose standard meaning is rarely of any use
      in the minibuffer. Major modes such as Dired or Rmail that do
      not allow self-insertion of text can reasonably redefine
      letters and other printing characters as special
      commands.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Major modes for editing text should not define <tt class=
    "key">RET</tt> to do anything other than insert a newline.
    However, it is ok for specialized modes for text that users
    don&rsquo;t directly edit, such as Dired and Info modes, to
    redefine <tt class="key">RET</tt> to do something entirely
    different.</li>

    <li>Major modes should not alter options that are primarily a
    matter of user preference, such as whether Auto-Fill mode is
    enabled. Leave this to each user to decide. However, a major
    mode should customize other variables so that Auto-Fill mode
    will work usefully <em>if</em> the user decides to use it.</li>

    <li><a name="index-syntax-tables-in-modes" id=
    "index-syntax-tables-in-modes"></a> The mode may have its own
    syntax table or may share one with other related modes. If it
    has its own syntax table, it should store this in a variable
    named <code><var>modename</var>-mode-syntax-table</code>. See
    <a href="Syntax-Tables.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax
    Tables</a>.</li>

    <li>If the mode handles a language that has a syntax for
    comments, it should set the variables that define the comment
    syntax. See <a href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Options-for-Comments.html#Options-for-Comments">
    Options Controlling Comments</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs
    Manual</cite>.</li>

    <li><a name="index-abbrev-tables-in-modes" id=
    "index-abbrev-tables-in-modes"></a> The mode may have its own
    abbrev table or may share one with other related modes. If it
    has its own abbrev table, it should store this in a variable
    named <code><var>modename</var>-mode-abbrev-table</code>. If
    the major mode command defines any abbrevs itself, it should
    pass <code>t</code> for the <var>system-flag</var> argument to
    <code>define-abbrev</code>. See <a href=
    "Defining-Abbrevs.html#Defining-Abbrevs">Defining
    Abbrevs</a>.</li>

    <li>The mode should specify how to do highlighting for Font
    Lock mode, by setting up a buffer-local value for the variable
    <code>font-lock-defaults</code> (see <a href=
    "Font-Lock-Mode.html#Font-Lock-Mode">Font Lock Mode</a>).</li>

    <li>Each face that the mode defines should, if possible,
    inherit from an existing Emacs face. See <a href=
    "Basic-Faces.html#Basic-Faces">Basic Faces</a>, and <a href=
    "Faces-for-Font-Lock.html#Faces-for-Font-Lock">Faces for Font
    Lock</a>.</li>

    <li>The mode should specify how Imenu should find the
    definitions or sections of a buffer, by setting up a
    buffer-local value for the variable
    <code>imenu-generic-expression</code>, for the two variables
    <code>imenu-prev-index-position-function</code> and
    <code>imenu-extract-index-name-function</code>, or for the
    variable <code>imenu-create-index-function</code> (see <a href=
    "Imenu.html#Imenu">Imenu</a>).</li>

    <li>The mode can specify a local value for
    <code>eldoc-documentation-function</code> to tell ElDoc mode
    how to handle this mode.</li>

    <li>The mode can specify how to complete various keywords by
    adding one or more buffer-local entries to the special hook
    <code>completion-at-point-functions</code>. See <a href=
    "Completion-in-Buffers.html#Completion-in-Buffers">Completion
    in Buffers</a>.</li>

    <li>
      <a name="index-buffer_002dlocal-variables-in-modes" id=
      "index-buffer_002dlocal-variables-in-modes"></a> To make a
      buffer-local binding for an Emacs customization variable, use
      <code>make-local-variable</code> in the major mode command,
      not <code>make-variable-buffer-local</code>. The latter
      function would make the variable local to every buffer in
      which it is subsequently set, which would affect buffers that
      do not use this mode. It is undesirable for a mode to have
      such global effects. See <a href=
      "Buffer_002dLocal-Variables.html#Buffer_002dLocal-Variables">Buffer-Local
      Variables</a>.

      <p>With rare exceptions, the only reasonable way to use
      <code>make-variable-buffer-local</code> in a Lisp package is
      for a variable which is used only within that package. Using
      it on a variable used by other packages would interfere with
      them.</p>
    </li>

    <li><a name="index-mode-hook" id="index-mode-hook"></a>
    <a name="index-major-mode-hook" id="index-major-mode-hook"></a>
    Each major mode should have a normal <em>mode hook</em> named
    <code><var>modename</var>-mode-hook</code>. The very last thing
    the major mode command should do is to call
    <code>run-mode-hooks</code>. This runs the normal hook
    <code>change-major-mode-after-body-hook</code>, the mode hook,
    and then the normal hook
    <code>after-change-major-mode-hook</code>. See <a href=
    "Mode-Hooks.html#Mode-Hooks">Mode Hooks</a>.</li>

    <li>The major mode command may start by calling some other
    major mode command (called the <em>parent mode</em>) and then
    alter some of its settings. A mode that does this is called a
    <em>derived mode</em>. The recommended way to define one is to
    use the <code>define-derived-mode</code> macro, but this is not
    required. Such a mode should call the parent mode command
    inside a <code>delay-mode-hooks</code> form. (Using
    <code>define-derived-mode</code> does this automatically.) See
    <a href="Derived-Modes.html#Derived-Modes">Derived Modes</a>,
    and <a href="Mode-Hooks.html#Mode-Hooks">Mode Hooks</a>.</li>

    <li>If something special should be done if the user switches a
    buffer from this mode to any other major mode, this mode can
    set up a buffer-local value for
    <code>change-major-mode-hook</code> (see <a href=
    "Creating-Buffer_002dLocal.html#Creating-Buffer_002dLocal">Creating
    Buffer-Local</a>).</li>

    <li>If this mode is appropriate only for specially-prepared
    text produced by the mode itself (rather than by the user
    typing at the keyboard or by an external file), then the major
    mode command symbol should have a property named
    <code>mode-class</code> with value <code>special</code>, put on
    as follows: <a name="index-mode_002dclass-_0028property_0029"
    id="index-mode_002dclass-_0028property_0029"></a> <a name=
    "index-special-modes" id="index-special-modes"></a>

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
(put 'funny-mode 'mode-class 'special)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This tells Emacs that new buffers created while the
      current buffer is in Funny mode should not be put in Funny
      mode, even though the default value of
      <code>major-mode</code> is <code>nil</code>. By default, the
      value of <code>nil</code> for <code>major-mode</code> means
      to use the current buffer&rsquo;s major mode when creating
      new buffers (see <a href=
      "Auto-Major-Mode.html#Auto-Major-Mode">Auto Major Mode</a>),
      but with such <code>special</code> modes, Fundamental mode is
      used instead. Modes such as Dired, Rmail, and Buffer List use
      this feature.</p>

      <p>The function <code>view-buffer</code> does not enable View
      mode in buffers whose mode-class is special, because such
      modes usually provide their own View-like bindings.</p>

      <p>The <code>define-derived-mode</code> macro automatically
      marks the derived mode as special if the parent mode is
      special. Special mode is a convenient parent for such modes
      to inherit from; See <a href=
      "Basic-Major-Modes.html#Basic-Major-Modes">Basic Major
      Modes</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>If you want to make the new mode the default for files with
    certain recognizable names, add an element to
    <code>auto-mode-alist</code> to select the mode for those file
    names (see <a href="Auto-Major-Mode.html#Auto-Major-Mode">Auto
    Major Mode</a>). If you define the mode command to autoload,
    you should add this element in the same file that calls
    <code>autoload</code>. If you use an autoload cookie for the
    mode command, you can also use an autoload cookie for the form
    that adds the element (see <a href=
    "Autoload.html#autoload-cookie">autoload cookie</a>). If you do
    not autoload the mode command, it is sufficient to add the
    element in the file that contains the mode definition.</li>

    <li><a name="index-mode-loading" id="index-mode-loading"></a>
    The top-level forms in the file defining the mode should be
    written so that they may be evaluated more than once without
    adverse consequences. For instance, use <code>defvar</code> or
    <code>defcustom</code> to set mode-related variables, so that
    they are not reinitialized if they already have a value (see
    <a href="Defining-Variables.html#Defining-Variables">Defining
    Variables</a>).</li>
