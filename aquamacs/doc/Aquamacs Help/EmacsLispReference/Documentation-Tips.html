  <h3 class="section">D.6 Tips for Documentation
  Strings</h3><a name=
  "index-documentation-strings_002c-conventions-and-tips" id=
  "index-documentation-strings_002c-conventions-and-tips"></a>
  <a name="index-checkdoc_002dminor_002dmode" id=
  "index-checkdoc_002dminor_002dmode"></a>

  <p>Here are some tips and conventions for the writing of
  documentation strings. You can check many of these conventions by
  running the command <kbd>M-x checkdoc-minor-mode</kbd>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Every command, function, or variable intended for users to
    know about should have a documentation string.</li>

    <li>An internal variable or subroutine of a Lisp program might
    as well have a documentation string. Documentation strings take
    up very little space in a running Emacs.</li>

    <li>Format the documentation string so that it fits in an Emacs
    window on an 80-column screen. It is a good idea for most lines
    to be no wider than 60 characters. The first line should not be
    wider than 67 characters or it will look bad in the output of
    <code>apropos</code>. <a name=
    "index-emacs_002dlisp_002ddocstring_002dfill_002dcolumn" id=
    "index-emacs_002dlisp_002ddocstring_002dfill_002dcolumn"></a>

      <p>You can fill the text if that looks good. Emacs Lisp mode
      fills documentation strings to the width specified by
      <code>emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column</code>. However, you
      can sometimes make a documentation string much more readable
      by adjusting its line breaks with care. Use blank lines
      between sections if the documentation string is long.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The first line of the documentation string should consist
    of one or two complete sentences that stand on their own as a
    summary. <kbd>M-x apropos</kbd> displays just the first line,
    and if that line&rsquo;s contents don&rsquo;t stand on their
    own, the result looks bad. In particular, start the first line
    with a capital letter and end it with a period.

      <p>For a function, the first line should briefly answer the
      question, &ldquo;What does this function do?&rdquo; For a
      variable, the first line should briefly answer the question,
      &ldquo;What does this value mean?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Don&rsquo;t limit the documentation string to one line;
      use as many lines as you need to explain the details of how
      to use the function or variable. Please use complete
      sentences for the rest of the text too.</p>
    </li>

    <li>When the user tries to use a disabled command, Emacs
    displays just the first paragraph of its documentation
    string&mdash;everything through the first blank line. If you
    wish, you can choose which information to include before the
    first blank line so as to make this display useful.</li>

    <li>The first line should mention all the important arguments
    of the function, and should mention them in the order that they
    are written in a function call. If the function has many
    arguments, then it is not feasible to mention them all in the
    first line; in that case, the first line should mention the
    first few arguments, including the most important
    arguments.</li>

    <li>When a function&rsquo;s documentation string mentions the
    value of an argument of the function, use the argument name in
    capital letters as if it were a name for that value. Thus, the
    documentation string of the function <code>eval</code> refers
    to its first argument as &lsquo;<samp>FORM</samp>&rsquo;,
    because the actual argument name is <code>form</code>:

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
Evaluate FORM and return its value.
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Also write metasyntactic variables in capital letters,
      such as when you show the decomposition of a list or vector
      into subunits, some of which may vary.
      &lsquo;<samp>KEY</samp>&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;<samp>VALUE</samp>&rsquo; in the following example
      illustrate this practice:</p>

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
The argument TABLE should be an alist whose elements
have the form (KEY . VALUE).  Here, KEY is ...
</pre>
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>Never change the case of a Lisp symbol when you mention it
    in a doc string. If the symbol&rsquo;s name is
    <code>foo</code>, write &ldquo;foo&rdquo;, not
    &ldquo;Foo&rdquo; (which is a different symbol).

      <p>This might appear to contradict the policy of writing
      function argument values, but there is no real contradiction;
      the argument <em>value</em> is not the same thing as the
      <em>symbol</em> that the function uses to hold the value.</p>

      <p>If this puts a lower-case letter at the beginning of a
      sentence and that annoys you, rewrite the sentence so that
      the symbol is not at the start of it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Do not start or end a documentation string with
    whitespace.</li>

    <li><strong>Do not</strong> indent subsequent lines of a
    documentation string so that the text is lined up in the source
    code with the text of the first line. This looks nice in the
    source code, but looks bizarre when users view the
    documentation. Remember that the indentation before the
    starting double-quote is not part of the string! <a name=
    "Docstring-hyperlinks" id="Docstring-hyperlinks"></a></li>

    <li>
      <a name="index-curly-quotes-2" id="index-curly-quotes-2"></a>
      <a name="index-curved-quotes-2" id=
      "index-curved-quotes-2"></a> When a documentation string
      refers to a Lisp symbol, write it as it would be printed
      (which usually means in lower case), surrounding it with
      curved single quotes (<tt>&acirc;&euro;&tilde;</tt> and
      <tt>&acirc;&euro;&trade;</tt>). There are two exceptions:
      write <code>t</code> and <code>nil</code> without surrounding
      punctuation. For example: &lsquo;<samp>CODE can be
      &acirc;&euro;&tilde;lambda&acirc;&euro;&trade;, nil, or
      t</samp>&rsquo;. See <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Quotation-Marks.html#Quotation-Marks">
      Quotation Marks</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>, for
      how to enter curved single quotes.

      <p>Documentation strings can also use an older single-quoting
      convention, which quotes symbols with grave accent <tt>`</tt>
      and apostrophe <tt>'</tt>: <tt>`like-this'</tt> rather than
      <tt>&acirc;&euro;&tilde;like-this&acirc;&euro;&trade;</tt>.
      This older convention was designed for now-obsolete displays
      in which grave accent and apostrophe were mirror images.</p>

      <p>Documentation using either convention is converted to the
      user&rsquo;s preferred format when it is copied into a help
      buffer. See <a href=
      "Keys-in-Documentation.html#Keys-in-Documentation">Keys in
      Documentation</a>.</p><a name=
      "index-hyperlinks-in-documentation-strings" id=
      "index-hyperlinks-in-documentation-strings"></a>

      <p>Help mode automatically creates a hyperlink when a
      documentation string uses a single-quoted symbol name, if the
      symbol has either a function or a variable definition. You do
      not need to do anything special to make use of this feature.
      However, when a symbol has both a function definition and a
      variable definition, and you want to refer to just one of
      them, you can specify which one by writing one of the words
      &lsquo;<samp>variable</samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp>option</samp>&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;<samp>function</samp>&rsquo;, or
      &lsquo;<samp>command</samp>&rsquo;, immediately before the
      symbol name. (Case makes no difference in recognizing these
      indicator words.) For example, if you write</p>

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
This function sets the variable `buffer-file-name'.
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>then the hyperlink will refer only to the variable
      documentation of <code>buffer-file-name</code>, and not to
      its function documentation.</p>

      <p>If a symbol has a function definition and/or a variable
      definition, but those are irrelevant to the use of the symbol
      that you are documenting, you can write the words
      &lsquo;<samp>symbol</samp>&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;<samp>program</samp>&rsquo; before the symbol name to
      prevent making any hyperlink. For example,</p>

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
If the argument KIND-OF-RESULT is the symbol `list',
this function returns a list of all the objects
that satisfy the criterion.
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>does not make a hyperlink to the documentation, irrelevant
      here, of the function <code>list</code>.</p>

      <p>Normally, no hyperlink is made for a variable without
      variable documentation. You can force a hyperlink for such
      variables by preceding them with one of the words
      &lsquo;<samp>variable</samp>&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;<samp>option</samp>&rsquo;.</p>

      <p>Hyperlinks for faces are only made if the face name is
      preceded or followed by the word
      &lsquo;<samp>face</samp>&rsquo;. In that case, only the face
      documentation will be shown, even if the symbol is also
      defined as a variable or as a function.</p>

      <p>To make a hyperlink to Info documentation, write the
      single-quoted name of the Info node (or anchor), preceded by
      &lsquo;<samp>info node</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>Info
      node</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>info anchor</samp>&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;<samp>Info anchor</samp>&rsquo;. The Info file name
      defaults to &lsquo;<samp>emacs</samp>&rsquo;. For
      example,</p>

      <div class="smallexample">
        <pre class="smallexample">
See Info node `Font Lock' and Info node `(elisp)Font Lock Basics'.
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Finally, to create a hyperlink to URLs, write the
      single-quoted URL, preceded by
      &lsquo;<samp>URL</samp>&rsquo;. For example,</p>

      <div class="smallexample">
        <pre class="smallexample">
The home page for the GNU project has more information (see URL
`http://www.gnu.org/').
</pre>
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>Don&rsquo;t write key sequences directly in documentation
    strings. Instead, use the
    &lsquo;<samp>\\[&hellip;]</samp>&rsquo; construct to stand for
    them. For example, instead of writing
    &lsquo;<samp>C-f</samp>&rsquo;, write the construct
    &lsquo;<samp>\\[forward-char]</samp>&rsquo;. When Emacs
    displays the documentation string, it substitutes whatever key
    is currently bound to <code>forward-char</code>. (This is
    normally &lsquo;<samp>C-f</samp>&rsquo;, but it may be some
    other character if the user has moved key bindings.) See
    <a href="Keys-in-Documentation.html#Keys-in-Documentation">Keys
    in Documentation</a>.</li>

    <li>In documentation strings for a major mode, you will want to
    refer to the key bindings of that mode&rsquo;s local map,
    rather than global ones. Therefore, use the construct
    &lsquo;<samp>\\&lt;&hellip;&gt;</samp>&rsquo; once in the
    documentation string to specify which key map to use. Do this
    before the first use of
    &lsquo;<samp>\\[&hellip;]</samp>&rsquo;. The text inside the
    &lsquo;<samp>\\&lt;&hellip;&gt;</samp>&rsquo; should be the
    name of the variable containing the local keymap for the major
    mode.

      <p>It is not practical to use
      &lsquo;<samp>\\[&hellip;]</samp>&rsquo; very many times,
      because display of the documentation string will become slow.
      So use this to describe the most important commands in your
      major mode, and then use
      &lsquo;<samp>\\{&hellip;}</samp>&rsquo; to display the rest
      of the mode&rsquo;s keymap.</p>
    </li>

    <li>For consistency, phrase the verb in the first sentence of a
    function&rsquo;s documentation string as an
    imperative&mdash;for instance, use &ldquo;Return the cons of A
    and B.&rdquo; in preference to &ldquo;Returns the cons of A and
    B.&rdquo; Usually it looks good to do likewise for the rest of
    the first paragraph. Subsequent paragraphs usually look better
    if each sentence is indicative and has a proper subject.</li>

    <li>The documentation string for a function that is a yes-or-no
    predicate should start with words such as &ldquo;Return t
    if&rdquo;, to indicate explicitly what constitutes truth. The
    word &ldquo;return&rdquo; avoids starting the sentence with
    lower-case &ldquo;t&rdquo;, which could be somewhat
    distracting.</li>

    <li>If a line in a documentation string begins with an
    open-parenthesis, write a backslash before the
    open-parenthesis, like this:

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
The argument FOO can be either a number
\(a buffer position) or a string (a file name).
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This prevents the open-parenthesis from being treated as
      the start of a defun (see <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Defuns.html#Defuns">
      Defuns</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>).</p>
    </li>

    <li>Write documentation strings in the active voice, not the
    passive, and in the present tense, not the future. For
    instance, use &ldquo;Return a list containing A and B.&rdquo;
    instead of &ldquo;A list containing A and B will be
    returned.&rdquo;</li>

    <li>Avoid using the word &ldquo;cause&rdquo; (or its
    equivalents) unnecessarily. Instead of, &ldquo;Cause Emacs to
    display text in boldface&rdquo;, write just &ldquo;Display text
    in boldface&rdquo;.</li>

    <li>Avoid using &ldquo;iff&rdquo; (a mathematics term meaning
    &ldquo;if and only if&rdquo;), since many people are unfamiliar
    with it and mistake it for a typo. In most cases, the meaning
    is clear with just &ldquo;if&rdquo;. Otherwise, try to find an
    alternate phrasing that conveys the meaning.</li>

    <li>When a command is meaningful only in a certain mode or
    situation, do mention that in the documentation string. For
    example, the documentation of <code>dired-find-file</code> is:

      <div class="example">
        <pre class="example">
In Dired, visit the file or directory named on this line.
</pre>
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>When you define a variable that represents an option users
    might want to set, use <code>defcustom</code>. See <a href=
    "Defining-Variables.html#Defining-Variables">Defining
    Variables</a>.</li>

    <li>The documentation string for a variable that is a yes-or-no
    flag should start with words such as &ldquo;Non-nil
    means&rdquo;, to make it clear that all non-<code>nil</code>
    values are equivalent and indicate explicitly what
    <code>nil</code> and non-<code>nil</code> mean.</li>
  </ul>
