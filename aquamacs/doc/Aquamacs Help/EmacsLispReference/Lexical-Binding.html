  <h4 class="subsection">11.9.3 Lexical Binding</h4>

  <p>Lexical binding was introduced to Emacs, as an optional
  feature, in version 24.1. We expect its importance to increase in
  the future. Lexical binding opens up many more opportunities for
  optimization, so programs using it are likely to run faster in
  future Emacs versions. Lexical binding is also more compatible
  with concurrency, which we want to add to Emacs in the
  future.</p>

  <p>A lexically-bound variable has <em>lexical scope</em>, meaning
  that any reference to the variable must be located textually
  within the binding construct. Here is an example (see <a href=
  "Using-Lexical-Binding.html#Using-Lexical-Binding">Using Lexical
  Binding</a>, for how to actually enable lexical binding):</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(let ((x 1))    ; <span class=
"roman"><code>x</code> is lexically bound.</span>
  (+ x 3))
     &rArr; 4

(defun getx ()
  x)            ; <span class=
"roman"><code>x</code> is used free in this function.</span>

(let ((x 1))    ; <span class=
"roman"><code>x</code> is lexically bound.</span>
  (getx))
error&rarr; Symbol's value as variable is void: x
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here, the variable <code>x</code> has no global value. When it
  is lexically bound within a <code>let</code> form, it can be used
  in the textual confines of that <code>let</code> form. But it can
  <em>not</em> be used from within a <code>getx</code> function
  called from the <code>let</code> form, since the function
  definition of <code>getx</code> occurs outside the
  <code>let</code> form itself.</p><a name=
  "index-lexical-environment" id="index-lexical-environment"></a>

  <p>Here is how lexical binding works. Each binding construct
  defines a <em>lexical environment</em>, specifying the variables
  that are bound within the construct and their local values. When
  the Lisp evaluator wants the current value of a variable, it
  looks first in the lexical environment; if the variable is not
  specified in there, it looks in the symbol&rsquo;s value cell,
  where the dynamic value is stored.</p>

  <p>(Internally, the lexical environment is an alist of
  symbol-value pairs, with the final element in the alist being the
  symbol <code>t</code> rather than a cons cell. Such an alist can
  be passed as the second argument to the <code>eval</code>
  function, in order to specify a lexical environment in which to
  evaluate a form. See <a href="Eval.html#Eval">Eval</a>. Most
  Emacs Lisp programs, however, should not interact directly with
  lexical environments in this way; only specialized programs like
  debuggers.)</p><a name="index-closures_002c-example-of-using" id=
  "index-closures_002c-example-of-using"></a>

  <p>Lexical bindings have indefinite extent. Even after a binding
  construct has finished executing, its lexical environment can be
  &ldquo;kept around&rdquo; in Lisp objects called
  <em>closures</em>. A closure is created when you define a named
  or anonymous function with lexical binding enabled. See <a href=
  "Closures.html#Closures">Closures</a>, for details.</p>

  <p>When a closure is called as a function, any lexical variable
  references within its definition use the retained lexical
  environment. Here is an example:</p>

  <div class="example">
    <pre class="example">
(defvar my-ticker nil)   ; <span class=
"roman">We will use this dynamically bound</span>
                         ; <span class=
"roman">variable to store a closure.</span>

(let ((x 0))             ; <span class=
"roman"><code>x</code> is lexically bound.</span>
  (setq my-ticker (lambda ()
                    (setq x (1+ x)))))
    &rArr; (closure ((x . 0) t) ()
          (setq x (1+ x)))

(funcall my-ticker)
    &rArr; 1

(funcall my-ticker)
    &rArr; 2

(funcall my-ticker)
    &rArr; 3

x                        ; <span class=
"roman">Note that <code>x</code> has no global value.</span>
error&rarr; Symbol's value as variable is void: x
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>The <code>let</code> binding defines a lexical environment in
  which the variable <code>x</code> is locally bound to 0. Within
  this binding construct, we define a lambda expression which
  increments <code>x</code> by one and returns the incremented
  value. This lambda expression is automatically turned into a
  closure, in which the lexical environment lives on even after the
  <code>let</code> binding construct has exited. Each time we
  evaluate the closure, it increments <code>x</code>, using the
  binding of <code>x</code> in that lexical environment.</p>

  <p>Note that unlike dynamic variables which are tied to the
  symbol object itself, the relationship between lexical variables
  and symbols is only present in the interpreter (or compiler).
  Therefore, functions which take a symbol argument (like
  <code>symbol-value</code>, <code>boundp</code>, and
  <code>set</code>) can only retrieve or modify a variable&rsquo;s
  dynamic binding (i.e., the contents of its symbol&rsquo;s value
  cell).</p>
