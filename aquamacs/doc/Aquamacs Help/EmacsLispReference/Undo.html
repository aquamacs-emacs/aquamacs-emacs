<h3 class="section">31.9 Undo</h3>
<a name="index-redo"></a>

<p>Most buffers have an <em>undo list</em>, which records all changes made
to the buffer&rsquo;s text so that they can be undone.  (The buffers that
don&rsquo;t have one are usually special-purpose buffers for which Emacs
assumes that undoing is not useful.  In particular, any buffer whose
name begins with a space has its undo recording off by default;
see <a href="Buffer-Names.html#Buffer-Names">Buffer Names</a>.)  All the primitives that modify the
text in the buffer automatically add elements to the front of the undo
list, which is in the variable <code>buffer-undo-list</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-buffer_002dundo_002dlist"></a>Variable: <strong>buffer-undo-list</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This buffer-local variable&rsquo;s value is the undo list of the current
buffer.  A value of <code>t</code> disables the recording of undo information.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Here are the kinds of elements an undo list can have:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code><var>position</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>This kind of element records a previous value of point; undoing this
element moves point to <var>position</var>.  Ordinary cursor motion does not
make any sort of undo record, but deletion operations use these entries
to record where point was before the command.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>(<var>beg</var> . <var>end</var>)</code></dt>
<dd><p>This kind of element indicates how to delete text that was inserted.
Upon insertion, the text occupied the range <var>beg</var>&ndash;<var>end</var> in the
buffer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>(<var>text</var> . <var>position</var>)</code></dt>
<dd><p>This kind of element indicates how to reinsert text that was deleted.
The deleted text itself is the string <var>text</var>.  The place to
reinsert it is <code>(abs <var>position</var>)</code>.  If <var>position</var> is
positive, point was at the beginning of the deleted text, otherwise it
was at the end.  Zero or more (<var>marker</var> . <var>adjustment</var>)
elements follow immediately after this element.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>(t . <var>time-flag</var>)</code></dt>
<dd><p>This kind of element indicates that an unmodified buffer became
modified.  A <var>time-flag</var> of the form
<code>(<var>sec-high</var> <var>sec-low</var> <var>microsec</var>
<var>picosec</var>)</code> represents the visited file&rsquo;s modification time as of
when it was previously visited or saved, using the same format as
<code>current-time</code>; see <a href="Time-of-Day.html#Time-of-Day">Time of Day</a>.
A <var>time-flag</var> of 0 means the buffer does not correspond to any file;
−1 means the visited file previously did not exist.
<code>primitive-undo</code> uses these
values to determine whether to mark the buffer as unmodified once again;
it does so only if the file&rsquo;s status matches that of <var>time-flag</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>(nil <var>property</var> <var>value</var> <var>beg</var> . <var>end</var>)</code></dt>
<dd><p>This kind of element records a change in a text property.
Here&rsquo;s how you might undo the change:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(put-text-property <var>beg</var> <var>end</var> <var>property</var> <var>value</var>)
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>(<var>marker</var> . <var>adjustment</var>)</code></dt>
<dd><p>This kind of element records the fact that the marker <var>marker</var> was
relocated due to deletion of surrounding text, and that it moved
<var>adjustment</var> character positions.  If the marker&rsquo;s location is
consistent with the (<var>text</var> . <var>position</var>) element preceding it
in the undo list, then undoing this element moves <var>marker</var>
− <var>adjustment</var> characters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>(apply <var>funname</var> . <var>args</var>)</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is an extensible undo item, which is undone by calling
<var>funname</var> with arguments <var>args</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>(apply <var>delta</var> <var>beg</var> <var>end</var> <var>funname</var> . <var>args</var>)</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is an extensible undo item, which records a change limited to the
range <var>beg</var> to <var>end</var>, which increased the size of the buffer
by <var>delta</var> characters.  It is undone by calling <var>funname</var> with
arguments <var>args</var>.
</p>
<p>This kind of element enables undo limited to a region to determine
whether the element pertains to that region.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>nil</code></dt>
<dd><p>This element is a boundary.  The elements between two boundaries are
called a <em>change group</em>; normally, each change group corresponds to
one keyboard command, and undo commands normally undo an entire group as
a unit.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-undo_002dboundary"></a>Function: <strong>undo-boundary</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This function places a boundary element in the undo list.  The undo
command stops at such a boundary, and successive undo commands undo
to earlier and earlier boundaries.  This function returns <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<p>Calling this function explicitly is useful for splitting the effects of
a command into more than one unit.  For example, <code>query-replace</code>
calls <code>undo-boundary</code> after each replacement, so that the user can
undo individual replacements one by one.
</p>
<p>Mostly, however, this function is called automatically at an
appropriate time.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-undo_002dauto_002damalgamate"></a>Function: <strong>undo-auto-amalgamate</strong></dt>
<dd><a name="index-amalgamating-commands_002c-and-undo"></a>
<p>The editor command loop automatically calls <code>undo-boundary</code> just
before executing each key sequence, so that each undo normally undoes
the effects of one command.  A few exceptional commands are
<em>amalgamating</em>: these commands generally cause small changes to
buffers, so with these a boundary is inserted only every 20th command,
allowing the changes to be undone as a group.  By default, the commands
<code>self-insert-command</code>, which produces self-inserting input
characters (see <a href="Commands-for-Insertion.html#Commands-for-Insertion">Commands for Insertion</a>), and <code>delete-char</code>,
which deletes characters (see <a href="Deletion.html#Deletion">Deletion</a>), are amalgamating.
Where a command affects the contents of several buffers, as may happen,
for example, when a function on the <code>post-command-hook</code> affects a
buffer other than the <code>current-buffer</code>, then <code>undo-boundary</code>
will be called in each of the affected buffers.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-undo_002dauto_002dcurrent_002dboundary_002dtimer"></a>Variable: <strong>undo-auto-current-boundary-timer</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Some buffers, such as process buffers, can change even when no
commands are executing.  In these cases, <code>undo-boundary</code> is
normally called periodically by the timer in this variable.  Setting
this variable to non-<code>nil</code> prevents this behavior.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-undo_002din_002dprogress"></a>Variable: <strong>undo-in-progress</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable is normally <code>nil</code>, but the undo commands bind it to
<code>t</code>.  This is so that various kinds of change hooks can tell when
they&rsquo;re being called for the sake of undoing.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-primitive_002dundo"></a>Function: <strong>primitive-undo</strong> <em>count list</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is the basic function for undoing elements of an undo list.
It undoes the first <var>count</var> elements of <var>list</var>, returning
the rest of <var>list</var>.
</p>
<p><code>primitive-undo</code> adds elements to the buffer&rsquo;s undo list when it
changes the buffer.  Undo commands avoid confusion by saving the undo
list value at the beginning of a sequence of undo operations.  Then the
undo operations use and update the saved value.  The new elements added
by undoing are not part of this saved value, so they don&rsquo;t interfere with
continuing to undo.
</p>
<p>This function does not bind <code>undo-in-progress</code>.
</p></dd></dl>
