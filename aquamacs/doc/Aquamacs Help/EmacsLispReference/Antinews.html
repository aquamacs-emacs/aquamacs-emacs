  <h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Emacs 24 Antinews</h2>

  <p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is
  information about downgrading to Emacs version 24.5. We hope you
  will enjoy the greater simplicity that results from the absence
  of many Emacs 25.1 features.</p><a name=
  "Old-Lisp-Features-in-Emacs-24" id=
  "Old-Lisp-Features-in-Emacs-24"></a>

  <h3 class="section">A.1 Old Lisp Features in Emacs 24</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The requirement that <code>setq</code> and
    <code>setf</code> must be called with an even number of
    arguments has been removed. You can now call them with an odd
    number of arguments, and Emacs will helpfully supply a
    <code>nil</code> for the missing one. Simplicity rules!</li>

    <li><kbd>M-x shell</kbd> and <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> set the
    <code>EMACS</code> environment variable, as they should, to
    indicate that the subprocess is run by Emacs. This is so
    packages that took years to learn how to work around that
    setting could continue using their code to that effect.</li>

    <li>The <code>save-excursion</code> form saves and restores the
    mark, as expected. No more need for the new
    <code>save-mark-and-excursion</code>, which has been
    deleted.</li>

    <li>We have removed the <code>text-quoting-style</code>
    variable and the associated functionality that translates quote
    characters in messages displayed to the user and in help
    buffers. Emacs now shows exactly the same quote characters as
    you wrote in your code! Likewise,
    <code>substitute-command-keys</code> leaves the quote
    characters alone. As you move back in time, Unicode support
    becomes less and less important, so no need to display those
    fancy new quotes the Unicode Standard invented.</li>

    <li>Regular expressions have been simplified by removing
    support for Unicode character properties in regexp classes. As
    result, <code>[:alpha:]</code> and <code>[:alnum:]</code> will
    match any character with a word syntax, and
    <code>[:graph:]</code> and <code>[:print:]</code> will match
    any multibyte character, including surrogates and unassigned
    codepoints. Once again, this is in line with diminishing
    importance of Unicode as you move back in time.</li>

    <li>Evaluating &lsquo;<samp>(/ <var>n</var>)</samp>&rsquo; will
    now yield <var>n</var>. We have realized that interpreting that
    as in Common Lisp was a bad mistake that needed to be
    corrected.</li>

    <li>The <code>pcase</code> form was significantly simplified by
    removing the UPatterns <code>quote</code> and <code>app</code>.
    To further simplify this facility, we&rsquo;ve removed
    <code>pcase-defmacro</code>, since we found no need for letting
    Lisp programs define new UPatterns.</li>

    <li>We&rsquo;ve removed the text properties
    <code>cursor-intangible</code> and
    <code>cursor-sensor-functions</code>, replacing them by the
    much simpler <code>intangible</code>,
    <code>point-entered</code>, and <code>point-left</code>
    properties. The latter are implemented on a much lower level,
    and therefore are better integrated with user expectations. For
    similar reasons, <code>cursor-intangible-mode</code> and
    <code>cursor-sensor-mode</code> were removed; use the hook
    variable <code>inhibit-point-motion-hooks</code> which is no
    longer obsolete.</li>

    <li>Process creation and management functions were
    significantly improved and simplified by removing
    <code>make-process</code> and the <code>pipe</code> connection
    type. Redirecting <code>stderr</code> of a subprocess should be
    done with shell facilities, not by Emacs.</li>

    <li>We decided that shutting up informative messages is bad for
    user interaction, so we&rsquo;ve removed the
    <code>inhibit-message</code> variable which could be used to
    that effect.</li>

    <li>Support for generators and for finalizers has been removed,
    as we found no real need for these facilities.</li>

    <li>Due to excessive complexity and the diminishing need for
    Unicode support, the functions
    <code>string-collate-lessp</code> and
    <code>string-collate-equalp</code> were removed. Their
    locale-independent counterparts <code>string-lessp</code> and
    <code>string-equal</code> are so much more simple and yield
    predictable results that we don&rsquo;t see any situation where
    the locale-dependent collation could be useful in Emacs. As
    result, the <samp>ls-lisp.el</samp> package sorts files in a
    locale-independent manner.</li>

    <li>In preparation for removal in some past version of Emacs of
    the bidirectional editing support, we started by deleting two
    functions <code>bidi-find-overridden-directionality</code> and
    <code>buffer-substring-with-bidi-context</code>.</li>

    <li>Time conversion functions, such as
    <code>current-time-string</code>, no longer accept an optional
    <var>zone</var> argument. If you need to change the current
    time zone (why?), do that explicitly with
    <code>set-time-zone-rule</code>.</li>

    <li>As part of the ongoing quest for simplicity, many other
    functions and variables have been eliminated.</li>
  </ul>
