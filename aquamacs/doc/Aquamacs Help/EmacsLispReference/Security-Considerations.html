  "index-security" id="index-security"></a> <a name=
  "index-hardening" id="index-hardening"></a>

  <p>Like any application, Emacs can be run in a secure
  environment, where the operating system enforces rules about
  access and the like. With some care, Emacs-based applications can
  also be part of a security perimeter that checks such rules.
  Although the default settings for Emacs work well for a typical
  software development environment, they may require adjustment in
  environments containing untrusted users that may include
  attackers. Here is a compendium of security issues that may be
  helpful if you are developing such applications. It is by no
  means complete; it is intended to give you an idea of the
  security issues involved, rather than to be a security
  checklist.</p>

  <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>File local variables</dt>

    <dd>
      <a name="index-file-local-variables-1" id=
      "index-file-local-variables-1"></a>

      <p>A file that Emacs visits can contain variable settings
      that affects the buffer visiting that file; See <a href=
      "File-Local-Variables.html#File-Local-Variables">File Local
      Variables</a>. Similarly, a directory can specify local
      variable values common to all files in that directory; See
      <a href=
      "Directory-Local-Variables.html#Directory-Local-Variables">Directory
      Local Variables</a>. Although Emacs takes some effort to
      protect against misuse of these variables, a security hole
      can be created merely by a package setting
      <code>safe-local-variable</code> too optimistically, a
      problem that is all too common. To disable this feature for
      both files and directories, set
      <code>enable-local-variables</code> to <code>nil</code>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Access control</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Although Emacs normally respects access permissions of the
      underlying operating system, in some cases it handles
      accesses specially. For example, file names can have handlers
      that treat the files specially, with their own access
      checking. See <a href=
      "Magic-File-Names.html#Magic-File-Names">Magic File
      Names</a>. Also, a buffer can be read-only even if the
      corresponding file is writeable, and vice versa, which can
      result in messages such as &lsquo;<samp>File passwd is
      write-protected; try to save anyway? (yes or
      no)</samp>&rsquo;. See <a href=
      "Read-Only-Buffers.html#Read-Only-Buffers">Read Only
      Buffers</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Authentication</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Emacs has several functions that deal with passwords,
      e.g., <code>read-passwd</code>. See <a href=
      "Reading-a-Password.html#Reading-a-Password">Reading a
      Password</a>. Although these functions do not attempt to
      broadcast passwords to the world, their implementations are
      not proof against determined attackers with access to Emacs
      internals. For example, even if Elisp code uses
      <code>clear-string</code> to scrub a password from its memory
      after using it, remnants of the password may still reside in
      the garbage-collected free list. See <a href=
      "Modifying-Strings.html#Modifying-Strings">Modifying
      Strings</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Code injection</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Emacs can send commands to many other applications, and
      applications should take care that strings sent as operands
      of these commands are not misinterpreted as directives. For
      example, when using a shell command to rename a file
      <var>a</var> to <var>b</var>, do not simply use the string
      <code>mv <var>a</var> <var>b</var></code>, because either
      file name might start with &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo;, or
      might contain shell metacharacters like
      &lsquo;<samp>;</samp>&rsquo;. Although functions like
      <code>shell-quote-argument</code> can help avoid this sort of
      problem, they are not panaceas; for example, on a POSIX
      platform <code>shell-quote-argument</code> quotes shell
      metacharacters but not leading &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo;.
      See <a href="Shell-Arguments.html#Shell-Arguments">Shell
      Arguments</a>. Typically it is safer to use
      <code>call-process</code> than a subshell. See <a href=
      "Synchronous-Processes.html#Synchronous-Processes">Synchronous
      Processes</a>. And it is safer yet to use builtin Emacs
      functions; for example, use <code>(rename-file "<var>a</var>"
      "<var>b</var>" t)</code> instead of invoking <code>mv</code>.
      See <a href="Changing-Files.html#Changing-Files">Changing
      Files</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Coding systems</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Emacs attempts to infer the coding systems of the files
      and network connections it accesses. See <a href=
      "Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>. If
      Emacs infers incorrectly, or if the other parties to the
      network connection disagree with Emacs&rsquo;s inferences,
      the resulting system could be unreliable. Also, even when it
      infers correctly, Emacs often can use bytes that other
      programs cannot. For example, although to Emacs the null byte
      is just a character like any other, many other applications
      treat it as a string terminator and mishandle strings or
      files containing null bytes.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Environment and configuration variables</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>POSIX specifies several environment variables that can
      affect how Emacs behaves. Any environment variable whose name
      consists entirely of uppercase ASCII letters, digits, and the
      underscore may affect the internal behavior of Emacs. Emacs
      uses several such variables, e.g.,
      <code>EMACSLOADPATH</code>. See <a href=
      "Library-Search.html#Library-Search">Library Search</a>. On
      some platforms some environment variables (e.g.,
      <code>PATH</code>, <code>POSIXLY_CORRECT</code>,
      <code>SHELL</code>, <code>TMPDIR</code>) need to have
      properly-configured values in order to get standard behavior
      for any utility Emacs might invoke. Even seemingly-benign
      variables like <code>TZ</code> may have security
      implications. See <a href=
      "System-Environment.html#System-Environment">System
      Environment</a>.</p>

      <p>Emacs has customization and other variables with similar
      considerations. For example, if the variable
      <code>shell-file-name</code> specifies a shell with
      nonstandard behavior, an Emacs-based application may
      misbehave.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Installation</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>When Emacs is installed, if the installation directory
      hierarchy can be modified by untrusted users, the application
      cannot be trusted. This applies also to the directory
      hierarchies of the programs that Emacs uses, and of the files
      that Emacs reads and writes.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Network access</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Emacs often accesses the network, and you may want to
      configure it to avoid network accesses that it would normally
      do. For example, unless you set <code>tramp-mode</code> to
      <code>nil</code>, file names using a certain syntax are
      interpreted as being network files, and are retrieved across
      the network. See <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/index.html#Top">
      The Tramp Manual</a> in <cite>The Tramp Manual</cite>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Race conditions</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Emacs applications have the same sort of race-condition
      issues that other applications do. For example, even when
      <code>(file-readable-p "foo.txt")</code> returns
      <code>t</code>, it could be that <samp>foo.txt</samp> is
      unreadable because some other program changed the
      file&rsquo;s permissions between the call to
      <code>file-readable-p</code> and now. See <a href=
      "Testing-Accessibility.html#Testing-Accessibility">Testing
      Accessibility</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Resource limits</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>When Emacs exhausts memory or other operating system
      resources, its behavior can be less reliable, in that
      computations that ordinarily run to completion may abort back
      to the top level. This may cause Emacs to neglect operations
      that it normally would have done.</p>
