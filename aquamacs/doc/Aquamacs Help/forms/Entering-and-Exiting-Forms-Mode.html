<h2 class="chapter">2 Entering and Exiting Forms Mode</h2>

     
<a name="index-forms_002dfind_002dfile-1"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>M-x forms-find-file &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>control-file</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Visit a database using Forms mode.  Specify the name of the
<strong>control file</strong>, not the data file!

     <p><a name="index-forms_002dfind_002dfile_002dother_002dwindow-2"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-x forms-find-file-other-window &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>control-file</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Similar, but displays the file in another window. 
</dl>

   <p>The command <code>forms-find-file</code> evaluates the file
<var>control-file</var>, and also visits it in Forms mode.  What you see in
its buffer is not the contents of this file, but rather a single record
of the corresponding data file that is visited in its own buffer.  So
there are two buffers involved in Forms mode: the <dfn>forms buffer</dfn>
that is initially used to visit the control file and that shows the
records being browsed, and the <dfn>data buffer</dfn> that holds the data
file being visited.  The latter buffer is normally not visible.

   <p>Initially, the first record is displayed in the forms buffer. 
The mode line displays the major mode name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forms</span></samp>&rsquo;, followed by the
minor mode &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">View</span></samp>&rsquo; if the data base is read-only.  The number of the
current record (<var>n</var>) and the total number of records in the
file(<var>t</var>) are shown in the mode line as &lsquo;<samp><var>n</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>t</var></samp>&rsquo;.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     --%%-Emacs: passwd-demo          (Forms View 1/54)----All-------
</pre>
   <p>If the buffer is not read-only, you may change the buffer to modify the
fields in the record.  When you move to a different record, the contents
of the buffer are parsed using the specifications in
<code>forms-format-list</code>, and the data file is updated.  If the record
has fields that aren't included in the display, they are not changed.

   <p><a name="index-forms_002dmode_002dhooks-3"></a>Entering Forms mode runs the normal hook <code>forms-mode-hooks</code> to
perform user-defined customization.

   <p>To save any modified data, you can use <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>
(<code>forms-save-buffer</code>).  This does not save the forms buffer (which would
be rather useless), but instead saves the buffer visiting the data file.

   <p>To terminate Forms mode, you can use <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> (<code>forms-save-buffer</code>)
and then kill the forms buffer.  However, the data buffer will still
remain.  If this is not desired, you have to kill this buffer too.
