<h5 class="subsubheading">Question 4.9</h5>

<p>Is there a way to automatically ignore posts by specific
authors or with specific words in the subject? And can I
highlight more interesting ones in some way?

<h5 class="subsubheading">Answer</h5>

<p>You want Scoring. Scoring means, that you define rules
which assign each message an integer value. Depending on
the value the message is highlighted in summary buffer (if
it's high, say +2000) or automatically marked read (if the
value is low, say -800) or some other action happens.

   <p>There are basically three ways of setting up rules which assign
the scoring-value to messages. The first and easiest way is to set
up rules based on the article you are just reading. Say you're
reading a message by a guy who always writes nonsense and you want
to ignore his messages in the future. Hit
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo;, to set up a rule which lowers the score. 
Now Gnus asks you which the criteria for lowering the Score shall
be. Hit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; twice to see all possibilities,
we want &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; which means the author (the from
header). Now Gnus wants to know which kind of matching we want. 
Hit either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo; for an exact match or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; for substring-match and delete afterwards
everything but the name to score down all authors with the given
name no matter which email address is used. Now you need to tell
Gnus when to apply the rule and how long it should last, hit e.g. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; to apply the rule now and let it last
forever. If you want to raise the score instead of lowering it say
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">I</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>You can also set up rules by hand. To do this say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">V
f</span></samp>&rsquo; in summary buffer. Then you are asked for the name
of the score file, it's name.of.group.SCORE for rules valid in
only one group or all.Score for rules valid in all groups. See the
Gnus manual for the exact syntax, basically it's one big list
whose elements are lists again. the first element of those lists
is the header to score on, then one more list with what to match,
which score to assign, when to expire the rule and how to do the
matching. If you find me very interesting, you could e.g. add the
following to your all.Score:

<pre class="example">     (("references" ("hschmi22.userfqdn.rz-online.de" 500 nil s))
      ("message-id" ("hschmi22.userfqdn.rz-online.de" 999 nil s)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This would add 999 to the score of messages written by me
and 500 to the score of messages which are a (possibly
indirect) answer to a message written by me. Of course
nobody with a sane mind would do this :-)

   <p>The third alternative is adaptive scoring. This means Gnus
watches you and tries to find out what you find
interesting and what annoying and sets up rules
which reflect this. Adaptive scoring can be a huge help
when reading high traffic groups. If you want to activate
adaptive scoring say

<pre class="example">     (setq gnus-use-adaptive-scoring t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in ~/.gnus.el.
