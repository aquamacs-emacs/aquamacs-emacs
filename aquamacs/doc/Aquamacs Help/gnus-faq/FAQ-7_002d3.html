<h5 class="subsubheading">Question 7.3</h5>

<p>I want to store article bodies on disk, too. How to do it?

<h5 class="subsubheading">Answer</h5>

<p>You can tell the agent to automatically fetch the bodies
of articles which fulfill certain predicates, this is
done in a special buffer which can be reached by
saying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">J c</span></samp>&rsquo; in group
buffer. Please refer to the documentation for
information which predicates are possible and how
exactly to do it.

   <p>Further on you can tell the agent manually which
articles to store on disk. There are two ways to do
this: Number one: In the summary buffer, process mark a
set of articles that shall be stored in the agent by
saying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; with point over the
article and then type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">J s</span></samp>&rsquo;. The
other possibility is to set, again in the summary
buffer, downloadable (%) marks for the articles you
want by typing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; with point over
the article and then typing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">J u</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
What's the difference? Well, process marks are erased as
soon as you exit the summary buffer while downloadable
marks are permanent.  You can actually set downloadable
marks in several groups then use fetch session ('J s' in
the GROUP buffer) to fetch all of those articles.  The
only downside is that fetch session also fetches all of
the headers for every selected group on an agentized
server.  Depending on the volume of headers, the initial
fetch session could take hours.
