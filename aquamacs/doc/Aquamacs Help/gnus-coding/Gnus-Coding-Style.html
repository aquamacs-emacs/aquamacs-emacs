<h3 class="section">1.1 Dependencies</h3>

<p>The Gnus distribution contains a lot of libraries that have been written
for Gnus and used intensively for Gnus.  But many of those libraries are
useful on their own.  E.g. other Emacs Lisp packages might use the
<acronym>MIME</acronym> library See <a href="../emacs-mime/index.html#Top">Top</a>.

<!-- As of 2005-10-21... -->
<code>rfc1843-gnus-setup</code> seem to be useful only for Gnus.  Maybe this
function should be relocated to remove dependencies on Gnus.  Other
minor dependencies: <code>gnus-newsgroup-name</code> could be eliminated by
using an optional argument to <code>rfc1843-decode-article-body</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.5 message</h4>

<p>All message composition from Gnus (both mail and news) takes place in
Message mode buffers.  Message mode is intended to be a replacement for
Emacs mail mode.  There should be no Gnus dependencies in
<samp><span class="file">message.el</span></samp>.  Alas it is not anymore.  Patches and suggestions to
remove the dependencies are welcome.

<!-- message.el requires nnheader which requires gnus-util. -->
<h4 class="subsection">1.1.6 Emacs <acronym>MIME</acronym></h4>

<p>The files <samp><span class="file">mml*.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">mm-*.el</span></samp> provide <acronym>MIME</acronym>
functionality for Emacs.

   <p><acronym>MML</acronym> (<acronym>MIME</acronym> Meta Language) is supposed to be
independent from Gnus.  Alas it is not anymore.  Patches and suggestions
to remove the dependencies are welcome.

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.7 Gnus backends</h4>

<p>The files <samp><span class="file">nn*.el</span></samp> provide functionality for accessing NNTP
(<samp><span class="file">nntp.el</span></samp>), IMAP (<samp><span class="file">nnimap.el</span></samp>) and several other Mail back
ends (probably <samp><span class="file">nnml.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">nnfolder.el</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">nnmaildir.el</span></samp> are the most widely used mail back ends).

<!-- mm-uu requires nnheader which requires gnus-util.  message.el also -->
<!-- requires nnheader. -->
<h3 class="section">1.2 Compatibility</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Emacs 21.1 and up.
