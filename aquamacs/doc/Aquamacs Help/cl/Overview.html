<h2 class="chapter">2 Overview</h2>

<p class="noindent">Common Lisp is a huge language, and Common Lisp systems tend to be
massive and extremely complex.  Emacs Lisp, by contrast, is rather
minimalist in the choice of Lisp features it offers the programmer. 
As Emacs Lisp programmers have grown in number, and the applications
they write have grown more ambitious, it has become clear that Emacs
Lisp could benefit from many of the conveniences of Common Lisp.

   <p>The <dfn>CL</dfn> package adds a number of Common Lisp functions and
control structures to Emacs Lisp.  While not a 100% complete
implementation of Common Lisp, <dfn>CL</dfn> adds enough functionality
to make Emacs Lisp programming significantly more convenient.

   <p><strong>Please note:</strong> the <dfn>CL</dfn> functions are not standard parts of
the Emacs Lisp name space, so it is legitimate for users to define
them with other, conflicting meanings.  To avoid conflicting with
those user activities, we have a policy that packages installed in
Emacs must not load <dfn>CL</dfn> at run time.  (It is ok for them to load
<dfn>CL</dfn> at compile time only, with <code>eval-when-compile</code>, and use
the macros it provides.)  If you are writing packages that you plan to
distribute and invite widespread use for, you might want to observe
the same rule.

   <p>Some Common Lisp features have been omitted from this package
for various reasons:

     <ul>
<li>Some features are too complex or bulky relative to their benefit
to Emacs Lisp programmers.  CLOS and Common Lisp streams are fine
examples of this group.

     <li>Other features cannot be implemented without modification to the
Emacs Lisp interpreter itself, such as multiple return values,
lexical scoping, case-insensitive symbols, and complex numbers. 
The <dfn>CL</dfn> package generally makes no attempt to emulate these
features.

     <li>Some features conflict with existing things in Emacs Lisp.  For
example, Emacs' <code>assoc</code> function is incompatible with the
Common Lisp <code>assoc</code>.  In such cases, this package usually
adds the suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to the function name of the Common
Lisp version of the function (e.g., <code>assoc*</code>). 
</ul>

   <p>The package described here was written by Dave Gillespie,
<samp><span class="file">daveg@synaptics.com</span></samp>.  It is a total rewrite of the original
1986 <samp><span class="file">cl.el</span></samp> package by Cesar Quiroz.  Most features of the
Quiroz package have been retained; any incompatibilities are
noted in the descriptions below.  Care has been taken in this
version to ensure that each function is defined efficiently,
concisely, and with minimal impact on the rest of the Emacs
environment.
