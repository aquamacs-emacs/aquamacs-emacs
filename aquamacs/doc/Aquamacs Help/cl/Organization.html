<h3 class="section">2.2 Organization</h3>

<p class="noindent">The Common Lisp package is organized into four files:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">cl.el</span></samp><dd>This is the &ldquo;main&rdquo; file, which contains basic functions
and information about the package.  This file is relatively
compact&mdash;about 700 lines.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">cl-extra.el</span></samp><dd>This file contains the larger, more complex or unusual functions. 
It is kept separate so that packages which only want to use Common
Lisp fundamentals like the <code>cadr</code> function won't need to pay
the overhead of loading the more advanced functions.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">cl-seq.el</span></samp><dd>This file contains most of the advanced functions for operating
on sequences or lists, such as <code>delete-if</code> and <code>assoc*</code>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">cl-macs.el</span></samp><dd>This file contains the features of the packages which are macros
instead of functions.  Macros expand when the caller is compiled,
not when it is run, so the macros generally only need to be
present when the byte-compiler is running (or when the macros are
used in uncompiled code such as a <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file).  Most of
the macros of this package are isolated in <samp><span class="file">cl-macs.el</span></samp> so
that they won't take up memory unless you are compiling. 
</dl>

   <p>The file <samp><span class="file">cl.el</span></samp> includes all necessary <code>autoload</code>
commands for the functions and macros in the other three files. 
All you have to do is <code>(require 'cl)</code>, and <samp><span class="file">cl.el</span></samp>
will take care of pulling in the other files when they are
needed.

   <p>There is another file, <samp><span class="file">cl-compat.el</span></samp>, which defines some
routines from the older <samp><span class="file">cl.el</span></samp> package that are no longer
present in the new package.  This includes internal routines
like <code>setelt</code> and <code>zip-lists</code>, deprecated features
like <code>defkeyword</code>, and an emulation of the old-style
multiple-values feature.  See <a href="Old-CL-Compatibility.html#Old-CL-Compatibility">Old CL Compatibility</a>.
