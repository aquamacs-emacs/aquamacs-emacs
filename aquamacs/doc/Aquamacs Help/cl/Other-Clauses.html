<h4 class="subsection">5.7.6 Other Clauses</h4>

<p class="noindent">This section describes the remaining loop clauses.

     <dl>
<dt><code>with </code><var>var</var><code> = </code><var>value</var><dd>This clause binds a variable to a value around the loop, but
otherwise leaves the variable alone during the loop.  The following
loops are basically equivalent:

     <pre class="example">          (loop with x = 17 do ...)
          (let ((x 17)) (loop do ...))
          (loop for x = 17 then x do ...)
</pre>
     <p>Naturally, the variable <var>var</var> might be used for some purpose
in the rest of the loop.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          (loop for x in my-list  with res = nil  do (push x res)
                finally return res)
</pre>
     <p>This loop inserts the elements of <code>my-list</code> at the front of
a new list being accumulated in <code>res</code>, then returns the
list <code>res</code> at the end of the loop.  The effect is similar
to that of a <code>collect</code> clause, but the list gets reversed
by virtue of the fact that elements are being pushed onto the
front of <code>res</code> rather than the end.

     <p>If you omit the <code>=</code> term, the variable is initialized to
<code>nil</code>.  (Thus the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">= nil</span></samp>&rsquo; in the above example is
unnecessary.)

     <p>Bindings made by <code>with</code> are sequential by default, as if
by <code>let*</code>.  Just like <code>for</code> clauses, <code>with</code> clauses
can be linked with <code>and</code> to cause the bindings to be made by
<code>let</code> instead.

     <br><dt><code>if </code><var>condition</var> <var>clause</var><dd>This clause executes the following loop clause only if the specified
condition is true.  The following <var>clause</var> should be an accumulation,
<code>do</code>, <code>return</code>, <code>if</code>, or <code>unless</code> clause. 
Several clauses may be linked by separating them with <code>and</code>. 
These clauses may be followed by <code>else</code> and a clause or clauses
to execute if the condition was false.  The whole construct may
optionally be followed by the word <code>end</code> (which may be used to
disambiguate an <code>else</code> or <code>and</code> in a nested <code>if</code>).

     <p>The actual non-<code>nil</code> value of the condition form is available
by the name <code>it</code> in the &ldquo;then&rdquo; part.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          (setq funny-numbers '(6 13 -1))
               &rArr; (6 13 -1)
          (loop for x below 10
                if (oddp x)
                  collect x into odds
                  and if (memq x funny-numbers) return (cdr it) end
                else
                  collect x into evens
                finally return (vector odds evens))
               &rArr; [(1 3 5 7 9) (0 2 4 6 8)]
          (setq funny-numbers '(6 7 13 -1))
               &rArr; (6 7 13 -1)
          (loop &lt;<span class="roman">same thing again</span>&gt;)
               &rArr; (13 -1)
</pre>
     <p>Note the use of <code>and</code> to put two clauses into the &ldquo;then&rdquo;
part, one of which is itself an <code>if</code> clause.  Note also that
<code>end</code>, while normally optional, was necessary here to make
it clear that the <code>else</code> refers to the outermost <code>if</code>
clause.  In the first case, the loop returns a vector of lists
of the odd and even values of <var>x</var>.  In the second case, the
odd number 7 is one of the <code>funny-numbers</code> so the loop
returns early; the actual returned value is based on the result
of the <code>memq</code> call.

     <br><dt><code>when </code><var>condition</var> <var>clause</var><dd>This clause is just a synonym for <code>if</code>.

     <br><dt><code>unless </code><var>condition</var> <var>clause</var><dd>The <code>unless</code> clause is just like <code>if</code> except that the
sense of the condition is reversed.

     <br><dt><code>named </code><var>name</var><dd>This clause gives a name other than <code>nil</code> to the implicit
block surrounding the loop.  The <var>name</var> is the symbol to be
used as the block name.

     <br><dt><code>initially [do] </code><var>forms</var><code>...</code><dd>This keyword introduces one or more Lisp forms which will be
executed before the loop itself begins (but after any variables
requested by <code>for</code> or <code>with</code> have been bound to their
initial values).  <code>initially</code> clauses can appear anywhere;
if there are several, they are executed in the order they appear
in the loop.  The keyword <code>do</code> is optional.

     <br><dt><code>finally [do] </code><var>forms</var><code>...</code><dd>This introduces Lisp forms which will be executed after the loop
finishes (say, on request of a <code>for</code> or <code>while</code>). 
<code>initially</code> and <code>finally</code> clauses may appear anywhere
in the loop construct, but they are executed (in the specified
order) at the beginning or end, respectively, of the loop.

     <br><dt><code>finally return </code><var>form</var><dd>This says that <var>form</var> should be executed after the loop
is done to obtain a return value.  (Without this, or some other
clause like <code>collect</code> or <code>return</code>, the loop will simply
return <code>nil</code>.)  Variables bound by <code>for</code>, <code>with</code>,
or <code>into</code> will still contain their final values when <var>form</var>
is executed.

     <br><dt><code>do </code><var>forms</var><code>...</code><dd>The word <code>do</code> may be followed by any number of Lisp expressions
which are executed as an implicit <code>progn</code> in the body of the
loop.  Many of the examples in this section illustrate the use of
<code>do</code>.

     <br><dt><code>return </code><var>form</var><dd>This clause causes the loop to return immediately.  The following
Lisp form is evaluated to give the return value of the <code>loop</code>
form.  The <code>finally</code> clauses, if any, are not executed. 
Of course, <code>return</code> is generally used inside an <code>if</code> or
<code>unless</code>, as its use in a top-level loop clause would mean
the loop would never get to &ldquo;loop&rdquo; more than once.

     <p>The clause &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">return </span><var>form</var></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">do (return </span><var>form</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; (or <code>return-from</code> if the loop
was named).  The <code>return</code> clause is implemented a bit more
efficiently, though. 
</dl>

   <p>While there is no high-level way to add user extensions to <code>loop</code>
(comparable to <code>defsetf</code> for <code>setf</code>, say), this package
does offer two properties called <code>cl-loop-handler</code> and
<code>cl-loop-for-handler</code> which are functions to be called when
a given symbol is encountered as a top-level loop clause or
<code>for</code> clause, respectively.  Consult the source code in
file <samp><span class="file">cl-macs.el</span></samp> for details.

   <p>This package's <code>loop</code> macro is compatible with that of Common
Lisp, except that a few features are not implemented:  <code>loop-finish</code>
and data-type specifiers.  Naturally, the <code>for</code> clauses which
iterate over keymaps, overlays, intervals, frames, windows, and
buffers are Emacs-specific extensions.
