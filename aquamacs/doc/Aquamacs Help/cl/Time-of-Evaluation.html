<h3 class="section">3.2 Time of Evaluation</h3>

<p class="noindent">Normally, the byte-compiler does not actually execute the forms in
a file it compiles.  For example, if a file contains <code>(setq foo t)</code>,
the act of compiling it will not actually set <code>foo</code> to <code>t</code>. 
This is true even if the <code>setq</code> was a top-level form (i.e., not
enclosed in a <code>defun</code> or other form).  Sometimes, though, you
would like to have certain top-level forms evaluated at compile-time. 
For example, the compiler effectively evaluates <code>defmacro</code> forms
at compile-time so that later parts of the file can refer to the
macros that are defined.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>eval-when</b> (<var>situations...</var>)<var> forms...<a name="index-eval_002dwhen-5"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This form controls when the body <var>forms</var> are evaluated. 
The <var>situations</var> list may contain any set of the symbols
<code>compile</code>, <code>load</code>, and <code>eval</code> (or their long-winded
ANSI equivalents, <code>:compile-toplevel</code>, <code>:load-toplevel</code>,
and <code>:execute</code>).

        <p>The <code>eval-when</code> form is handled differently depending on
whether or not it is being compiled as a top-level form. 
Specifically, it gets special treatment if it is being compiled
by a command such as <code>byte-compile-file</code> which compiles files
or buffers of code, and it appears either literally at the
top level of the file or inside a top-level <code>progn</code>.

        <p>For compiled top-level <code>eval-when</code>s, the body <var>forms</var> are
executed at compile-time if <code>compile</code> is in the <var>situations</var>
list, and the <var>forms</var> are written out to the file (to be executed
at load-time) if <code>load</code> is in the <var>situations</var> list.

        <p>For non-compiled-top-level forms, only the <code>eval</code> situation is
relevant.  (This includes forms executed by the interpreter, forms
compiled with <code>byte-compile</code> rather than <code>byte-compile-file</code>,
and non-top-level forms.)  The <code>eval-when</code> acts like a
<code>progn</code> if <code>eval</code> is specified, and like <code>nil</code>
(ignoring the body <var>forms</var>) if not.

        <p>The rules become more subtle when <code>eval-when</code>s are nested;
consult Steele (second edition) for the gruesome details (and
some gruesome examples).

        <p>Some simple examples:

     <pre class="example">          ;; Top-level forms in foo.el:
          (eval-when (compile)           (setq foo1 'bar))
          (eval-when (load)              (setq foo2 'bar))
          (eval-when (compile load)      (setq foo3 'bar))
          (eval-when (eval)              (setq foo4 'bar))
          (eval-when (eval compile)      (setq foo5 'bar))
          (eval-when (eval load)         (setq foo6 'bar))
          (eval-when (eval compile load) (setq foo7 'bar))
</pre>
        <p>When <samp><span class="file">foo.el</span></samp> is compiled, these variables will be set during
the compilation itself:

     <pre class="example">          foo1  foo3  foo5  foo7      ; `compile'
</pre>
        <p>When <samp><span class="file">foo.elc</span></samp> is loaded, these variables will be set:

     <pre class="example">          foo2  foo3  foo6  foo7      ; `load'
</pre>
        <p>And if <samp><span class="file">foo.el</span></samp> is loaded uncompiled, these variables will
be set:

     <pre class="example">          foo4  foo5  foo6  foo7      ; `eval'
</pre>
        <p>If these seven <code>eval-when</code>s had been, say, inside a <code>defun</code>,
then the first three would have been equivalent to <code>nil</code> and the
last four would have been equivalent to the corresponding <code>setq</code>s.

        <p>Note that <code>(eval-when (load eval) ...)</code> is equivalent
to <code>(progn ...)</code> in all contexts.  The compiler treats
certain top-level forms, like <code>defmacro</code> (sort-of) and
<code>require</code>, as if they were wrapped in <code>(eval-when
(compile load eval) ...)</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Emacs includes two special forms related to <code>eval-when</code>. 
One of these, <code>eval-when-compile</code>, is not quite equivalent to
any <code>eval-when</code> construct and is described below.

   <p>The other form, <code>(eval-and-compile ...)</code>, is exactly
equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(eval-when (compile load eval) ...)</span></samp>&rsquo; and
so is not itself defined by this package.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>eval-when-compile</b><var> forms...<a name="index-eval_002dwhen_002dcompile-6"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <var>forms</var> are evaluated at compile-time; at execution time,
this form acts like a quoted constant of the resulting value.  Used
at top-level, <code>eval-when-compile</code> is just like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">eval-when
(compile eval)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In other contexts, <code>eval-when-compile</code>
allows code to be evaluated once at compile-time for efficiency
or other reasons.

        <p>This form is similar to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#.</span></samp>&rsquo; syntax of true Common Lisp. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>load-time-value</b><var> form<a name="index-load_002dtime_002dvalue-7"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <var>form</var> is evaluated at load-time; at execution time,
this form acts like a quoted constant of the resulting value.

        <p>Early Common Lisp had a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#,</span></samp>&rsquo; syntax that was similar to
this, but ANSI Common Lisp replaced it with <code>load-time-value</code>
and gave it more well-defined semantics.

        <p>In a compiled file, <code>load-time-value</code> arranges for <var>form</var>
to be evaluated when the <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> file is loaded and then used
as if it were a quoted constant.  In code compiled by
<code>byte-compile</code> rather than <code>byte-compile-file</code>, the
effect is identical to <code>eval-when-compile</code>.  In uncompiled
code, both <code>eval-when-compile</code> and <code>load-time-value</code>
act exactly like <code>progn</code>.

     <pre class="example">          (defun report ()
            (insert "This function was executed on: "
                    (current-time-string)
                    ", compiled on: "
                    (eval-when-compile (current-time-string))
                    ;; or '#.(current-time-string) in real Common Lisp
                    ", and loaded on: "
                    (load-time-value (current-time-string))))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">Byte-compiled, the above defun will result in the following code
(or its compiled equivalent, of course) in the <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> file:

     <pre class="example">          (setq --temp-- (current-time-string))
          (defun report ()
            (insert "This function was executed on: "
                    (current-time-string)
                    ", compiled on: "
                    '"Wed Jun 23 18:33:43 1993"
                    ", and loaded on: "
                    --temp--))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
