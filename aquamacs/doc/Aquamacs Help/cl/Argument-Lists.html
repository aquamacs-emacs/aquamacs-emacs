<h3 class="section">3.1 Argument Lists</h3>

<p class="noindent">Emacs Lisp's notation for argument lists of functions is a subset of
the Common Lisp notation.  As well as the familiar <code>&amp;optional</code>
and <code>&amp;rest</code> markers, Common Lisp allows you to specify default
values for optional arguments, and it provides the additional markers
<code>&amp;key</code> and <code>&amp;aux</code>.

   <p>Since argument parsing is built-in to Emacs, there is no way for
this package to implement Common Lisp argument lists seamlessly. 
Instead, this package defines alternates for several Lisp forms
which you must use if you need Common Lisp argument lists.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>defun*</b><var> name arglist body...<a name="index-defun_002a-1"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This form is identical to the regular <code>defun</code> form, except
that <var>arglist</var> is allowed to be a full Common Lisp argument
list.  Also, the function body is enclosed in an implicit block
called <var>name</var>; see <a href="Blocks-and-Exits.html#Blocks-and-Exits">Blocks and Exits</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>defsubst*</b><var> name arglist body...<a name="index-defsubst_002a-2"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is just like <code>defun*</code>, except that the function that
is defined is automatically proclaimed <code>inline</code>, i.e.,
calls to it may be expanded into in-line code by the byte compiler. 
This is analogous to the <code>defsubst</code> form;
<code>defsubst*</code> uses a different method (compiler macros) which
works in all versions of Emacs, and also generates somewhat more
efficient inline expansions.  In particular, <code>defsubst*</code>
arranges for the processing of keyword arguments, default values,
etc., to be done at compile-time whenever possible. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>defmacro*</b><var> name arglist body...<a name="index-defmacro_002a-3"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is identical to the regular <code>defmacro</code> form,
except that <var>arglist</var> is allowed to be a full Common Lisp
argument list.  The <code>&amp;environment</code> keyword is supported as
described in Steele.  The <code>&amp;whole</code> keyword is supported only
within destructured lists (see below); top-level <code>&amp;whole</code>
cannot be implemented with the current Emacs Lisp interpreter. 
The macro expander body is enclosed in an implicit block called
<var>name</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>function*</b><var> symbol-or-lambda<a name="index-function_002a-4"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is identical to the regular <code>function</code> form,
except that if the argument is a <code>lambda</code> form then that
form may use a full Common Lisp argument list. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Also, all forms (such as <code>defsetf</code> and <code>flet</code>) defined
in this package that include <var>arglist</var>s in their syntax allow
full Common Lisp argument lists.

   <p>Note that it is <em>not</em> necessary to use <code>defun*</code> in
order to have access to most <dfn>CL</dfn> features in your function. 
These features are always present; <code>defun*</code>'s only
difference from <code>defun</code> is its more flexible argument
lists and its implicit block.

   <p>The full form of a Common Lisp argument list is

<pre class="example">     (<var>var</var>...
      &amp;optional (<var>var</var> <var>initform</var> <var>svar</var>)...
      &amp;rest <var>var</var>
      &amp;key ((<var>keyword</var> <var>var</var>) <var>initform</var> <var>svar</var>)...
      &amp;aux (<var>var</var> <var>initform</var>)...)
</pre>
   <p>Each of the five argument list sections is optional.  The <var>svar</var>,
<var>initform</var>, and <var>keyword</var> parts are optional; if they are
omitted, then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span><var>var</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; may be written simply &lsquo;<samp><var>var</var></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The first section consists of zero or more <dfn>required</dfn> arguments. 
These arguments must always be specified in a call to the function;
there is no difference between Emacs Lisp and Common Lisp as far as
required arguments are concerned.

   <p>The second section consists of <dfn>optional</dfn> arguments.  These
arguments may be specified in the function call; if they are not,
<var>initform</var> specifies the default value used for the argument. 
(No <var>initform</var> means to use <code>nil</code> as the default.)  The
<var>initform</var> is evaluated with the bindings for the preceding
arguments already established; <code>(a &amp;optional (b (1+ a)))</code>
matches one or two arguments, with the second argument defaulting
to one plus the first argument.  If the <var>svar</var> is specified,
it is an auxiliary variable which is bound to <code>t</code> if the optional
argument was specified, or to <code>nil</code> if the argument was omitted. 
If you don't use an <var>svar</var>, then there will be no way for your
function to tell whether it was called with no argument, or with
the default value passed explicitly as an argument.

   <p>The third section consists of a single <dfn>rest</dfn> argument.  If
more arguments were passed to the function than are accounted for
by the required and optional arguments, those extra arguments are
collected into a list and bound to the &ldquo;rest&rdquo; argument variable. 
Common Lisp's <code>&amp;rest</code> is equivalent to that of Emacs Lisp. 
Common Lisp accepts <code>&amp;body</code> as a synonym for <code>&amp;rest</code> in
macro contexts; this package accepts it all the time.

   <p>The fourth section consists of <dfn>keyword</dfn> arguments.  These
are optional arguments which are specified by name rather than
positionally in the argument list.  For example,

<pre class="example">     (defun* foo (a &amp;optional b &amp;key c d (e 17)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">defines a function which may be called with one, two, or more
arguments.  The first two arguments are bound to <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> in the usual way.  The remaining arguments must be
pairs of the form <code>:c</code>, <code>:d</code>, or <code>:e</code> followed
by the value to be bound to the corresponding argument variable. 
(Symbols whose names begin with a colon are called <dfn>keywords</dfn>,
and they are self-quoting in the same way as <code>nil</code> and
<code>t</code>.)

   <p>For example, the call <code>(foo 1 2 :d 3 :c 4)</code> sets the five
arguments to 1, 2, 4, 3, and 17, respectively.  If the same keyword
appears more than once in the function call, the first occurrence
takes precedence over the later ones.  Note that it is not possible
to specify keyword arguments without specifying the optional
argument <code>b</code> as well, since <code>(foo 1 :c 2)</code> would bind
<code>b</code> to the keyword <code>:c</code>, then signal an error because
<code>2</code> is not a valid keyword.

   <p>You can also explicitly specify the keyword argument; it need not be
simply the variable name prefixed with a colon.  For example,

<pre class="example">     (defun* bar (&amp;key (a 1) ((baz b) 4)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">specifies a keyword <code>:a</code> that sets the variable <code>a</code> with
default value 1, as well as a keyword <code>baz</code> that sets the
variable <code>b</code> with default value 4.  In this case, because
<code>baz</code> is not self-quoting, you must quote it explicitly in the
function call, like this:

<pre class="example">     (bar :a 10 'baz 42)
</pre>
   <p>Ordinarily, it is an error to pass an unrecognized keyword to
a function, e.g., <code>(foo 1 2 :c 3 :goober 4)</code>.  You can ask
Lisp to ignore unrecognized keywords, either by adding the
marker <code>&amp;allow-other-keys</code> after the keyword section
of the argument list, or by specifying an <code>:allow-other-keys</code>
argument in the call whose value is non-<code>nil</code>.  If the
function uses both <code>&amp;rest</code> and <code>&amp;key</code> at the same time,
the &ldquo;rest&rdquo; argument is bound to the keyword list as it appears
in the call.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun* find-thing (thing &amp;rest rest &amp;key need &amp;allow-other-keys)
       (or (apply 'member* thing thing-list :allow-other-keys t rest)
           (if need (error "Thing not found"))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This function takes a <code>:need</code> keyword argument, but also
accepts other keyword arguments which are passed on to the
<code>member*</code> function.  <code>allow-other-keys</code> is used to
keep both <code>find-thing</code> and <code>member*</code> from complaining
about each others' keywords in the arguments.

   <p>The fifth section of the argument list consists of <dfn>auxiliary
variables</dfn>.  These are not really arguments at all, but simply
variables which are bound to <code>nil</code> or to the specified
<var>initforms</var> during execution of the function.  There is no
difference between the following two functions, except for a
matter of stylistic taste:

<pre class="example">     (defun* foo (a b &amp;aux (c (+ a b)) d)
       <var>body</var>)
     
     (defun* foo (a b)
       (let ((c (+ a b)) d)
         <var>body</var>))
</pre>
   <p>Argument lists support <dfn>destructuring</dfn>.  In Common Lisp,
destructuring is only allowed with <code>defmacro</code>; this package
allows it with <code>defun*</code> and other argument lists as well. 
In destructuring, any argument variable (<var>var</var> in the above
diagram) can be replaced by a list of variables, or more generally,
a recursive argument list.  The corresponding argument value must
be a list whose elements match this recursive argument list. 
For example:

<pre class="example">     (defmacro* dolist ((var listform &amp;optional resultform)
                        &amp;rest body)
       ...)
</pre>
   <p>This says that the first argument of <code>dolist</code> must be a list
of two or three items; if there are other arguments as well as this
list, they are stored in <code>body</code>.  All features allowed in
regular argument lists are allowed in these recursive argument lists. 
In addition, the clause &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;whole </span><var>var</var></samp>&rsquo; is allowed at the
front of a recursive argument list.  It binds <var>var</var> to the
whole list being matched; thus <code>(&amp;whole all a b)</code> matches
a list of two things, with <code>a</code> bound to the first thing,
<code>b</code> bound to the second thing, and <code>all</code> bound to the
list itself.  (Common Lisp allows <code>&amp;whole</code> in top-level
<code>defmacro</code> argument lists as well, but Emacs Lisp does not
support this usage.)

   <p>One last feature of destructuring is that the argument list may be
dotted, so that the argument list <code>(a b . c)</code> is functionally
equivalent to <code>(a b &amp;rest c)</code>.

   <p>If the optimization quality <code>safety</code> is set to 0
(see <a href="Declarations.html#Declarations">Declarations</a>), error checking for wrong number of
arguments and invalid keyword arguments is disabled.  By default,
argument lists are rigorously checked.
