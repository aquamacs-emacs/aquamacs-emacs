<h4 class="subsection">5.3.3 Function Bindings</h4>

<p class="noindent">These forms make <code>let</code>-like bindings to functions instead
of variables.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>flet</b> (<var>bindings<small class="dots">...</small></var>)<var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-flet-34"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This form establishes <code>let</code>-style bindings on the function
cells of symbols rather than on the value cells.  Each <var>binding</var>
must be a list of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span><var>name</var> <var>arglist</var>
<var>forms</var><span class="samp">...)</span></samp>&rsquo;, which defines a function exactly as if
it were a <code>defun*</code> form.  The function <var>name</var> is defined
accordingly for the duration of the body of the <code>flet</code>; then
the old function definition, or lack thereof, is restored.

        <p>While <code>flet</code> in Common Lisp establishes a lexical binding of
<var>name</var>, Emacs Lisp <code>flet</code> makes a dynamic binding.  The
result is that <code>flet</code> affects indirect calls to a function as
well as calls directly inside the <code>flet</code> form itself.

        <p>You can use <code>flet</code> to disable or modify the behavior of a
function in a temporary fashion.  This will even work on Emacs
primitives, although note that some calls to primitive functions
internal to Emacs are made without going through the symbol's
function cell, and so will not be affected by <code>flet</code>.  For
example,

     <pre class="example">          (flet ((message (&amp;rest args) (push args saved-msgs)))
            (do-something))
</pre>
        <p>This code attempts to replace the built-in function <code>message</code>
with a function that simply saves the messages in a list rather
than displaying them.  The original definition of <code>message</code>
will be restored after <code>do-something</code> exits.  This code will
work fine on messages generated by other Lisp code, but messages
generated directly inside Emacs will not be caught since they make
direct C-language calls to the message routines rather than going
through the Lisp <code>message</code> function.

     <!-- Bug#411. -->
        <p>Also note that many primitives (e.g. <code>+</code>) have special byte-compile
handling.  Attempts to redefine such functions using <code>flet</code> will
fail if byte-compiled.  In such cases, use <code>labels</code> instead.

        <p>Functions defined by <code>flet</code> may use the full Common Lisp
argument notation supported by <code>defun*</code>; also, the function
body is enclosed in an implicit block as if by <code>defun*</code>. 
See <a href="Program-Structure.html#Program-Structure">Program Structure</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>labels</b> (<var>bindings<small class="dots">...</small></var>)<var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-labels-35"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>labels</code> form is like <code>flet</code>, except that it
makes lexical bindings of the function names rather than
dynamic bindings.  (In true Common Lisp, both <code>flet</code> and
<code>labels</code> make lexical bindings of slightly different sorts;
since Emacs Lisp is dynamically bound by default, it seemed
more appropriate for <code>flet</code> also to use dynamic binding. 
The <code>labels</code> form, with its lexical binding, is fully
compatible with Common Lisp.)

        <p>Lexical scoping means that all references to the named
functions must appear physically within the body of the
<code>labels</code> form.  References may appear both in the body
<var>forms</var> of <code>labels</code> itself, and in the bodies of
the functions themselves.  Thus, <code>labels</code> can define
local recursive functions, or mutually-recursive sets of
functions.

        <p>A &ldquo;reference&rdquo; to a function name is either a call to that
function, or a use of its name quoted by <code>quote</code> or
<code>function</code> to be passed on to, say, <code>mapcar</code>.
