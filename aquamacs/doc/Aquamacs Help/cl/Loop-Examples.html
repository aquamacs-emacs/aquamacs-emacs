<h4 class="subsection">5.7.2 Loop Examples</h4>

<p class="noindent">Before listing the full set of clauses that are allowed, let's
look at a few example loops just to get a feel for the <code>loop</code>
language.

<pre class="example">     (loop for buf in (buffer-list)
           collect (buffer-file-name buf))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This loop iterates over all Emacs buffers, using the list
returned by <code>buffer-list</code>.  For each buffer <code>buf</code>,
it calls <code>buffer-file-name</code> and collects the results into
a list, which is then returned from the <code>loop</code> construct. 
The result is a list of the file names of all the buffers in
Emacs' memory.  The words <code>for</code>, <code>in</code>, and <code>collect</code>
are reserved words in the <code>loop</code> language.

<pre class="example">     (loop repeat 20 do (insert "Yowsa\n"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This loop inserts the phrase &ldquo;Yowsa&rdquo; twenty times in the
current buffer.

<pre class="example">     (loop until (eobp) do (munch-line) (forward-line 1))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This loop calls <code>munch-line</code> on every line until the end
of the buffer.  If point is already at the end of the buffer,
the loop exits immediately.

<pre class="example">     (loop do (munch-line) until (eobp) do (forward-line 1))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This loop is similar to the above one, except that <code>munch-line</code>
is always called at least once.

<pre class="example">     (loop for x from 1 to 100
           for y = (* x x)
           until (&gt;= y 729)
           finally return (list x (= y 729)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This more complicated loop searches for a number <code>x</code> whose
square is 729.  For safety's sake it only examines <code>x</code>
values up to 100; dropping the phrase &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">to 100</span></samp>&rsquo; would
cause the loop to count upwards with no limit.  The second
<code>for</code> clause defines <code>y</code> to be the square of <code>x</code>
within the loop; the expression after the <code>=</code> sign is
reevaluated each time through the loop.  The <code>until</code>
clause gives a condition for terminating the loop, and the
<code>finally</code> clause says what to do when the loop finishes. 
(This particular example was written less concisely than it
could have been, just for the sake of illustration.)

   <p>Note that even though this loop contains three clauses (two
<code>for</code>s and an <code>until</code>) that would have been enough to
define loops all by themselves, it still creates a single loop
rather than some sort of triple-nested loop.  You must explicitly
nest your <code>loop</code> constructs if you want nested loops.
