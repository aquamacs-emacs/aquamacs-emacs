<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Efficiency Concerns</h2>

<h3 class="appendixsec">A.1 Macros</h3>

<p class="noindent">Many of the advanced features of this package, such as <code>defun*</code>,
<code>loop</code>, and <code>setf</code>, are implemented as Lisp macros.  In
byte-compiled code, these complex notations will be expanded into
equivalent Lisp code which is simple and efficient.  For example,
the forms

<pre class="example">     (incf i n)
     (push x (car p))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">are expanded at compile-time to the Lisp forms

<pre class="example">     (setq i (+ i n))
     (setcar p (cons x (car p)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which are the most efficient ways of doing these respective operations
in Lisp.  Thus, there is no performance penalty for using the more
readable <code>incf</code> and <code>push</code> forms in your compiled code.

   <p><em>Interpreted</em> code, on the other hand, must expand these macros
every time they are executed.  For this reason it is strongly
recommended that code making heavy use of macros be compiled. 
(The features labeled &ldquo;Special Form&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Function&rdquo; in
this manual are macros.)  A loop using <code>incf</code> a hundred times
will execute considerably faster if compiled, and will also
garbage-collect less because the macro expansion will not have
to be generated, used, and thrown away a hundred times.

   <p>You can find out how a macro expands by using the
<code>cl-prettyexpand</code> function.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>cl-prettyexpand</b><var> form &amp;optional full<a name="index-cl_002dprettyexpand-185"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function takes a single Lisp form as an argument and inserts
a nicely formatted copy of it in the current buffer (which must be
in Lisp mode so that indentation works properly).  It also expands
all Lisp macros which appear in the form.  The easiest way to use
this function is to go to the <code>*scratch*</code> buffer and type, say,

     <pre class="example">          (cl-prettyexpand '(loop for x below 10 collect x))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">and type <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> immediately after the closing parenthesis;
the expansion

     <pre class="example">          (block nil
            (let* ((x 0)
                   (G1004 nil))
              (while (&lt; x 10)
                (setq G1004 (cons x G1004))
                (setq x (+ x 1)))
              (nreverse G1004)))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">will be inserted into the buffer.  (The <code>block</code> macro is
expanded differently in the interpreter and compiler, so
<code>cl-prettyexpand</code> just leaves it alone.  The temporary
variable <code>G1004</code> was created by <code>gensym</code>.)

        <p>If the optional argument <var>full</var> is true, then <em>all</em>
macros are expanded, including <code>block</code>, <code>eval-when</code>,
and compiler macros.  Expansion is done as if <var>form</var> were
a top-level form in a file being compiled.  For example,

     <pre class="example">          (cl-prettyexpand '(pushnew 'x list))
               -| (setq list (adjoin 'x list))
          (cl-prettyexpand '(pushnew 'x list) t)
               -| (setq list (if (memq 'x list) list (cons 'x list)))
          (cl-prettyexpand '(caddr (member* 'a list)) t)
               -| (car (cdr (cdr (memq 'a list))))
</pre>
        <p>Note that <code>adjoin</code>, <code>caddr</code>, and <code>member*</code> all
have built-in compiler macros to optimize them in common cases. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<h3 class="appendixsec">A.2 Error Checking</h3>

<p class="noindent">Common Lisp compliance has in general not been sacrificed for the
sake of efficiency.  A few exceptions have been made for cases
where substantial gains were possible at the expense of marginal
incompatibility.

   <p>The Common Lisp standard (as embodied in Steele's book) uses the
phrase &ldquo;it is an error if&rdquo; to indicate a situation which is not
supposed to arise in complying programs; implementations are strongly
encouraged but not required to signal an error in these situations. 
This package sometimes omits such error checking in the interest of
compactness and efficiency.  For example, <code>do</code> variable
specifiers are supposed to be lists of one, two, or three forms;
extra forms are ignored by this package rather than signaling a
syntax error.  The <code>endp</code> function is simply a synonym for
<code>null</code> in this package.  Functions taking keyword arguments
will accept an odd number of arguments, treating the trailing
keyword as if it were followed by the value <code>nil</code>.

   <p>Argument lists (as processed by <code>defun*</code> and friends)
<em>are</em> checked rigorously except for the minor point just
mentioned; in particular, keyword arguments are checked for
validity, and <code>&amp;allow-other-keys</code> and <code>:allow-other-keys</code>
are fully implemented.  Keyword validity checking is slightly
time consuming (though not too bad in byte-compiled code);
you can use <code>&amp;allow-other-keys</code> to omit this check.  Functions
defined in this package such as <code>find</code> and <code>member*</code>
do check their keyword arguments for validity.

<h3 class="appendixsec">A.3 Optimizing Compiler</h3>

<p class="noindent">Use of the optimizing Emacs compiler is highly recommended; many of the Common
Lisp macros emit
code which can be improved by optimization.  In particular,
<code>block</code>s (whether explicit or implicit in constructs like
<code>defun*</code> and <code>loop</code>) carry a fair run-time penalty; the
optimizing compiler removes <code>block</code>s which are not actually
referenced by <code>return</code> or <code>return-from</code> inside the block.
