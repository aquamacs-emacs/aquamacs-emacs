<h2 class="appendix">Appendix C Old CL Compatibility</h2>

<p class="noindent">Following is a list of all known incompatibilities between this package
and the older Quiroz <samp><span class="file">cl.el</span></samp> package.

   <p>This package's emulation of multiple return values in functions is
incompatible with that of the older package.  That package attempted
to come as close as possible to true Common Lisp multiple return
values; unfortunately, it could not be 100% reliable and so was prone
to occasional surprises if used freely.  This package uses a simpler
method, namely replacing multiple values with lists of values, which
is more predictable though more noticeably different from Common Lisp.

   <p>The <code>defkeyword</code> form and <code>keywordp</code> function are not
implemented in this package.

   <p>The <code>member</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>ceiling</code>, <code>truncate</code>,
<code>round</code>, <code>mod</code>, and <code>rem</code> functions are suffixed
by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in this package to avoid collision with existing
functions in Emacs.  The older package simply
redefined these functions, overwriting the built-in meanings and
causing serious portability problems.  (Some more
recent versions of the Quiroz package changed the names to
<code>cl-member</code>, etc.; this package defines the latter names as
aliases for <code>member*</code>, etc.)

   <p>Certain functions in the old package which were buggy or inconsistent
with the Common Lisp standard are incompatible with the conforming
versions in this package.  For example, <code>eql</code> and <code>member</code>
were synonyms for <code>eq</code> and <code>memq</code> in that package, <code>setf</code>
failed to preserve correct order of evaluation of its arguments, etc.

   <p>Finally, unlike the older package, this package is careful to
prefix all of its internal names with <code>cl-</code>.  Except for a
few functions which are explicitly defined as additional features
(such as <code>floatp-safe</code> and <code>letf</code>), this package does not
export any non-&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cl-</span></samp>&rsquo; symbols which are not also part of Common
Lisp.

<h3 class="appendixsec">C.1 The <code>cl-compat</code> package</h3>

<p class="noindent">The <dfn>CL</dfn> package includes emulations of some features of the
old <samp><span class="file">cl.el</span></samp>, in the form of a compatibility package
<code>cl-compat</code>.  To use it, put <code>(require 'cl-compat)</code> in
your program.

   <p>The old package defined a number of internal routines without
<code>cl-</code> prefixes or other annotations.  Call to these routines
may have crept into existing Lisp code.  <code>cl-compat</code>
provides emulations of the following internal routines:
<code>pair-with-newsyms</code>, <code>zip-lists</code>, <code>unzip-lists</code>,
<code>reassemble-arglists</code>, <code>duplicate-symbols-p</code>,
<code>safe-idiv</code>.

   <p>Some <code>setf</code> forms translated into calls to internal
functions that user code might call directly.  The functions
<code>setnth</code>, <code>setnthcdr</code>, and <code>setelt</code> fall in
this category; they are defined by <code>cl-compat</code>, but the
best fix is to change to use <code>setf</code> properly.

   <p>The <code>cl-compat</code> file defines the keyword functions
<code>keywordp</code>, <code>keyword-of</code>, and <code>defkeyword</code>,
which are not defined by the new <dfn>CL</dfn> package because the
use of keywords as data is discouraged.

   <p>The <code>build-klist</code> mechanism for parsing keyword arguments
is emulated by <code>cl-compat</code>; the <code>with-keyword-args</code>
macro is not, however, and in any case it's best to change to
use the more natural keyword argument processing offered by
<code>defun*</code>.

   <p>Multiple return values are treated differently by the two
Common Lisp packages.  The old package's method was more
compatible with true Common Lisp, though it used heuristics
that caused it to report spurious multiple return values in
certain cases.  The <code>cl-compat</code> package defines a set
of multiple-value macros that are compatible with the old
CL package; again, they are heuristic in nature, but they
are guaranteed to work in any case where the old package's
macros worked.  To avoid name collision with the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
multiple-value facilities, the ones in <code>cl-compat</code> have
capitalized names:  <code>Values</code>, <code>Values-list</code>,
<code>Multiple-value-bind</code>, etc.

   <p>The functions <code>cl-floor</code>, <code>cl-ceiling</code>, <code>cl-truncate</code>,
and <code>cl-round</code> are defined by <code>cl-compat</code> to use the
old-style multiple-value mechanism, just as they did in the old
package.  The newer <code>floor*</code> and friends return their two
results in a list rather than as multiple values.  Note that
older versions of the old package used the unadorned names
<code>floor</code>, <code>ceiling</code>, etc.; <code>cl-compat</code> cannot use
these names because they conflict with Emacs built-ins.
