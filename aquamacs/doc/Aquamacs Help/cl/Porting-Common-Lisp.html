<h2 class="appendix">Appendix D Porting Common Lisp</h2>

<p class="noindent">This package is meant to be used as an extension to Emacs Lisp,
not as an Emacs implementation of true Common Lisp.  Some of the
remaining differences between Emacs Lisp and Common Lisp make it
difficult to port large Common Lisp applications to Emacs.  For
one, some of the features in this package are not fully compliant
with ANSI or Steele; see <a href="Common-Lisp-Compatibility.html#Common-Lisp-Compatibility">Common Lisp Compatibility</a>.  But there
are also quite a few features that this package does not provide
at all.  Here are some major omissions that you will want to watch out
for when bringing Common Lisp code into Emacs.

     <ul>
<li>Case-insensitivity.  Symbols in Common Lisp are case-insensitive
by default.  Some programs refer to a function or variable as
<code>foo</code> in one place and <code>Foo</code> or <code>FOO</code> in another. 
Emacs Lisp will treat these as three distinct symbols.

     <p>Some Common Lisp code is written entirely in upper case.  While Emacs
is happy to let the program's own functions and variables use
this convention, calls to Lisp builtins like <code>if</code> and
<code>defun</code> will have to be changed to lower case.

     <li>Lexical scoping.  In Common Lisp, function arguments and <code>let</code>
bindings apply only to references physically within their bodies
(or within macro expansions in their bodies).  Emacs Lisp, by
contrast, uses <dfn>dynamic scoping</dfn> wherein a binding to a
variable is visible even inside functions called from the body.

     <p>Variables in Common Lisp can be made dynamically scoped by
declaring them <code>special</code> or using <code>defvar</code>.  In Emacs
Lisp it is as if all variables were declared <code>special</code>.

     <p>Often you can use code that was written for lexical scoping
even in a dynamically scoped Lisp, but not always.  Here is
an example of a Common Lisp code fragment that would fail in
Emacs Lisp:

     <pre class="example">          (defun map-odd-elements (func list)
            (loop for x in list
                  for flag = t then (not flag)
                  collect (if flag x (funcall func x))))
          
          (defun add-odd-elements (list x)
            (map-odd-elements (lambda (a) (+ a x)) list))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">In Common Lisp, the two functions' usages of <code>x</code> are completely
independent.  In Emacs Lisp, the binding to <code>x</code> made by
<code>add-odd-elements</code> will have been hidden by the binding
in <code>map-odd-elements</code> by the time the <code>(+ a x)</code> function
is called.

     <p>(This package avoids such problems in its own mapping functions
by using names like <code>cl-x</code> instead of <code>x</code> internally;
as long as you don't use the <code>cl-</code> prefix for your own
variables no collision can occur.)

     <p>See <a href="Lexical-Bindings.html#Lexical-Bindings">Lexical Bindings</a>, for a description of the <code>lexical-let</code>
form which establishes a Common Lisp-style lexical binding, and some
examples of how it differs from Emacs' regular <code>let</code>.

     <li>Reader macros.  Common Lisp includes a second type of macro that
works at the level of individual characters.  For example, Common
Lisp implements the quote notation by a reader macro called <code>'</code>,
whereas Emacs Lisp's parser just treats quote as a special case. 
Some Lisp packages use reader macros to create special syntaxes
for themselves, which the Emacs parser is incapable of reading.

     <li>Other syntactic features.  Common Lisp provides a number of
notations beginning with <code>#</code> that the Emacs Lisp parser
won't understand.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#| ... |#</span></samp>&rsquo; is an
alternate comment notation, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#+lucid (foo)</span></samp>&rsquo; tells
the parser to ignore the <code>(foo)</code> except in Lucid Common
Lisp.

     <li>Packages.  In Common Lisp, symbols are divided into <dfn>packages</dfn>. 
Symbols that are Lisp built-ins are typically stored in one package;
symbols that are vendor extensions are put in another, and each
application program would have a package for its own symbols. 
Certain symbols are &ldquo;exported&rdquo; by a package and others are
internal; certain packages &ldquo;use&rdquo; or import the exported symbols
of other packages.  To access symbols that would not normally be
visible due to this importing and exporting, Common Lisp provides
a syntax like <code>package:symbol</code> or <code>package::symbol</code>.

     <p>Emacs Lisp has a single namespace for all interned symbols, and
then uses a naming convention of putting a prefix like <code>cl-</code>
in front of the name.  Some Emacs packages adopt the Common Lisp-like
convention of using <code>cl:</code> or <code>cl::</code> as the prefix. 
However, the Emacs parser does not understand colons and just
treats them as part of the symbol name.  Thus, while <code>mapcar</code>
and <code>lisp:mapcar</code> may refer to the same symbol in Common
Lisp, they are totally distinct in Emacs Lisp.  Common Lisp
programs which refer to a symbol by the full name sometimes
and the short name other times will not port cleanly to Emacs.

     <p>Emacs Lisp does have a concept of &ldquo;obarrays,&rdquo; which are
package-like collections of symbols, but this feature is not
strong enough to be used as a true package mechanism.

     <li>The <code>format</code> function is quite different between Common
Lisp and Emacs Lisp.  It takes an additional &ldquo;destination&rdquo;
argument before the format string.  A destination of <code>nil</code>
means to format to a string as in Emacs Lisp; a destination
of <code>t</code> means to write to the terminal (similar to
<code>message</code> in Emacs).  Also, format control strings are
utterly different; <code>~</code> is used instead of <code>%</code> to
introduce format codes, and the set of available codes is
much richer.  There are no notations like <code>\n</code> for
string literals; instead, <code>format</code> is used with the
&ldquo;newline&rdquo; format code, <code>~%</code>.  More advanced formatting
codes provide such features as paragraph filling, case
conversion, and even loops and conditionals.

     <p>While it would have been possible to implement most of Common
Lisp <code>format</code> in this package (under the name <code>format*</code>,
of course), it was not deemed worthwhile.  It would have required
a huge amount of code to implement even a decent subset of
<code>format*</code>, yet the functionality it would provide over
Emacs Lisp's <code>format</code> would rarely be useful.

     <li>Vector constants use square brackets in Emacs Lisp, but
<code>#(a b c)</code> notation in Common Lisp.  To further complicate
matters, Emacs has its own <code>#(</code> notation for
something entirely different&mdash;strings with properties.

     <li>Characters are distinct from integers in Common Lisp.  The notation
for character constants is also different: <code>#\A</code> in Common Lisp
where Emacs Lisp uses <code>?A</code>.  Also, <code>string=</code> and
<code>string-equal</code> are synonyms in Emacs Lisp, whereas the latter is
case-insensitive in Common Lisp.

     <li>Data types.  Some Common Lisp data types do not exist in Emacs
Lisp.  Rational numbers and complex numbers are not present,
nor are large integers (all integers are &ldquo;fixnums&rdquo;).  All
arrays are one-dimensional.  There are no readtables or pathnames;
streams are a set of existing data types rather than a new data
type of their own.  Hash tables, random-states, structures, and
packages (obarrays) are built from Lisp vectors or lists rather
than being distinct types.

     <li>The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) is not implemented,
nor is the Common Lisp Condition System.  However, the EIEIO package
(see <a href="../eieio/index.html#Top">Introduction</a>) does implement some
CLOS functionality.

     <li>Common Lisp features that are completely redundant with Emacs
Lisp features of a different name generally have not been
implemented.  For example, Common Lisp writes <code>defconstant</code>
where Emacs Lisp uses <code>defconst</code>.  Similarly, <code>make-list</code>
takes its arguments in different ways in the two Lisps but does
exactly the same thing, so this package has not bothered to
implement a Common Lisp-style <code>make-list</code>.

     <li>A few more notable Common Lisp features not included in this
package:  <code>compiler-let</code>, <code>tagbody</code>, <code>prog</code>,
<code>ldb/dpb</code>, <code>parse-integer</code>, <code>cerror</code>.

     <li>Recursion.  While recursion works in Emacs Lisp just like it
does in Common Lisp, various details of the Emacs Lisp system
and compiler make recursion much less efficient than it is in
most Lisps.  Some schools of thought prefer to use recursion
in Lisp over other techniques; they would sum a list of
numbers using something like

     <pre class="example">          (defun sum-list (list)
            (if list
                (+ (car list) (sum-list (cdr list)))
              0))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">where a more iteratively-minded programmer might write one of
these forms:

     <pre class="example">          (let ((total 0)) (dolist (x my-list) (incf total x)) total)
          (loop for x in my-list sum x)
</pre>
     <p>While this would be mainly a stylistic choice in most Common Lisps,
in Emacs Lisp you should be aware that the iterative forms are
much faster than recursion.  Also, Lisp programmers will want to
note that the current Emacs Lisp compiler does not optimize tail
recursion. 
</ul>
