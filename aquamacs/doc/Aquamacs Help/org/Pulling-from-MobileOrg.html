<h3 class="section">B.3 Pulling from MobileOrg</h3>

<p>When <i>MobileOrg</i> synchronizes with the WebDAV server, it not only pulls the
Org files for viewing.  It also appends captured entries and pointers to
flagged and changed entries to the file <samp><span class="file">mobileorg.org</span></samp> on the server. 
Org has a <em>pull</em> operation that integrates this information into an
inbox file and operates on the pointers to flagged entries.  Here is how it
works:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Org moves all entries found in
<samp><span class="file">mobileorg.org</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> and appends them to the file pointed to by the variable
<code>org-mobile-inbox-for-pull</code>.  Each captured entry and each editing event
will be a top-level entry in the inbox file. 
<li>After moving the entries, Org will attempt to implement the changes made in
<i>MobileOrg</i>.  Some changes are applied directly and without user
interaction.  Examples are all changes to tags, TODO state, headline and body
text that can be cleanly applied.  Entries that have been flagged for further
action will receive a tag <code>:FLAGGED:</code>, so that they can be easily found
again.  When there is a problem finding an entry or applying the change, the
pointer entry will remain in the inbox and will be marked with an error
message.  You need to later resolve these issues by hand. 
<li>Org will then generate an agenda view with all flagged entries.  The user
should then go through these entries and do whatever actions are necessary. 
If a note has been stored while flagging an entry in <i>MobileOrg</i>, that note
will be displayed in the echo area when the cursor is on the corresponding
agenda line.
          
<a name="index-g_t_003f-1463"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>?</kbd><dd>Pressing <kbd>?</kbd> in that special agenda will display the full flagging note in
another window and also push it onto the kill ring.  So you could use <kbd>? 
z C-y C-c C-c</kbd> to store that flagging note as a normal note in the entry. 
Pressing <kbd>?</kbd> twice in succession will offer to remove the
<code>:FLAGGED:</code> tag along with the recorded flagging note (which is stored
in a property).  In this way you indicate, that the intended processing for
this flagged entry is finished. 
</dl>
     </ol>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-a-_003f-1464"></a>If you are not able to process all flagged entries directly, you can always
return to this agenda view using <kbd>C-c a ?</kbd>.  Note, however, that there is
a subtle difference.  The view created automatically by <kbd>M-x
org-mobile-pull RET</kbd> is guaranteed to search all files that have been
addressed by the last pull.  This might include a file that is not currently
in your list of agenda files.  If you later use <kbd>C-c a ?</kbd> to regenerate
the view, only the current agenda files will be searched.
