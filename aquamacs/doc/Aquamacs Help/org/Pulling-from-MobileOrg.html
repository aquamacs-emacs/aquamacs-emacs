  <h3 class="section">B.3 Pulling from MobileOrg</h3>

  <p>When <i>MobileOrg</i> synchronizes with the server, it not
  only pulls the Org files for viewing. It also appends captured
  entries and pointers to flagged and changed entries to the file
  <samp><span class="file">mobileorg.org</span></samp> on the
  server. Org has a <em>pull</em> operation that integrates this
  information into an inbox file and operates on the pointers to
  flagged entries. Here is how it works:</p>

  <ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>Org moves all entries found in <samp><span class=
    "file">mobileorg.org</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href=
    "#fn-1" name="fnd-1" id="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> and appends
    them to the file pointed to by the variable
    <code>org-mobile-inbox-for-pull</code>. Each captured entry and
    each editing event will be a top-level entry in the inbox
    file.</li>

    <li>After moving the entries, Org will attempt to implement the
    changes made in <i>MobileOrg</i>. Some changes are applied
    directly and without user interaction. Examples are all changes
    to tags, TODO state, headline and body text that can be cleanly
    applied. Entries that have been flagged for further action will
    receive a tag <code>:FLAGGED:</code>, so that they can be
    easily found again. When there is a problem finding an entry or
    applying the change, the pointer entry will remain in the inbox
    and will be marked with an error message. You need to later
    resolve these issues by hand.</li>

    <li>Org will then generate an agenda view with all flagged
    entries. The user should then go through these entries and do
    whatever actions are necessary. If a note has been stored while
    flagging an entry in <i>MobileOrg</i>, that note will be
    displayed in the echo area when the cursor is on the
    corresponding agenda line. <a name="index-g_t_003f-1954" id=
    "index-g_t_003f-1954"></a>

      <dl>
        <dt><kbd>?</kbd></dt>

        <dd>Pressing <kbd>?</kbd> in that special agenda will
        display the full flagging note in another window and also
        push it onto the kill ring. So you could use <kbd>? z C-y
        C-c C-c</kbd> to store that flagging note as a normal note
        in the entry. Pressing <kbd>?</kbd> twice in succession
        will offer to remove the <code>:FLAGGED:</code> tag along
        with the recorded flagging note (which is stored in a
        property). In this way you indicate that the intended
        processing for this flagged entry is finished.</dd>
      </dl>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><a name="index-C_002dc-a-_003f-1955" id=
  "index-C_002dc-a-_003f-1955"></a>If you are not able to process
  all flagged entries directly, you can always return to this
  agenda view<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2" id=
  "fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a> using <kbd>C-c a ?</kbd>.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <hr />

    <h4>Footnotes</h4>

    <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1" id=
    "fn-1">1</a>]</small> <samp><span class=
    "file">mobileorg.org</span></samp> will be empty after this
    operation.</p>

    <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2" id=
    "fn-2">2</a>]</small> Note, however, that there is a subtle
    difference. The view created automatically by <kbd>M-x
    org-mobile-pull &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> is guaranteed to search all
    files that have been addressed by the last pull. This might
    include a file that is not currently in your list of agenda
    files. If you later use <kbd>C-c a ?</kbd> to regenerate the
    view, only the current agenda files will be searched.</p>
