<h4 class="subsection">10.3.6 Stuck projects</h4>

<p>If you are following a system like David Allen's GTD to organize your
work, one of the &ldquo;duties&rdquo; you have is a regular review to make sure
that all projects move along.  A <em>stuck</em> project is a project that
has no defined next actions, so it will never show up in the TODO lists
Org mode produces.  During the review, you need to identify such
projects and define next actions for them.

     
<a name="index-C_002dc-a-_0023-785"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>C-c a #</kbd><dd>List projects that are stuck. 
<a name="index-C_002dc-a-_0021-786"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-c a !</kbd><dd><a name="index-org_002dstuck_002dprojects-787"></a>Customize the variable <code>org-stuck-projects</code> to define what a stuck
project is and how to find it. 
</dl>

   <p>You almost certainly will have to configure this view before it will
work for you.  The built-in default assumes that all your projects are
level-2 headlines, and that a project is not stuck if it has at least
one entry marked with a TODO keyword TODO or NEXT or NEXTACTION.

   <p>Let's assume that you, in your own way of using Org mode, identify
projects with a tag PROJECT, and that you use a TODO keyword MAYBE to
indicate a project that should not be considered yet.  Let's further
assume that the TODO keyword DONE marks finished projects, and that NEXT
and TODO indicate next actions.  The tag @SHOP indicates shopping and
is a next action even without the NEXT tag.  Finally, if the project
contains the special word IGNORE anywhere, it should not be listed
either.  In this case you would start by identifying eligible projects
with a tags/todo match<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE</span></samp>&rsquo;, and then check for TODO, NEXT, @SHOP, and
IGNORE in the subtree to identify projects that are not stuck.  The
correct customization for this is

<pre class="lisp">     (setq org-stuck-projects
           '("+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE" ("NEXT" "TODO") ("@SHOP")
                                    "\\&lt;IGNORE\\&gt;"))
</pre>
   <p>Note that if a project is identified as non-stuck, the subtree of this entry
will still be searched for stuck projects.
