<h3 class="section">1.1 Summary</h3>

<p><a name="index-summary-2"></a>
Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

   <p>Org develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
lists or information about projects as plain text.  Org is
implemented on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to keep the
content of large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and
structure editing help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created
with a built-in table editor.  Org supports TODO items, deadlines,
timestamps, and scheduling.  It dynamically compiles entries into an
agenda that utilizes and smoothly integrates much of the Emacs calendar
and diary.  Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails,
Usenet messages, BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects. 
For printing and sharing of notes, an Org file can be exported as a
structured ASCII file, as HTML, or (TODO and agenda items only) as an
iCalendar file.  It can also serve as a publishing tool for a set of
linked web pages.

   <p>An important design aspect that distinguishes Org from, for example,
Planner/Muse is that it encourages you to store every piece of information
only once.  In Planner, you have project pages, day pages and possibly
other files, duplicating some information such as tasks.  In Org,
you only have notes files.  In your notes you mark entries as tasks, and
label them with tags and timestamps.  All necessary lists, like a
schedule for the day, the agenda for a meeting, tasks lists selected by
tags, etc., are created dynamically when you need them.

   <p>Org keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should
feel like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when you need
it.  Org is a toolbox and can be used in different ways, for
example as:

<pre class="example">     <span class="roman">&bull; an outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing</span>
     <span class="roman">&bull; an ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes</span>
     <span class="roman">&bull; an ASCII table editor with spreadsheet-like capabilities</span>
     <span class="roman">&bull; a TODO list editor</span>
     <span class="roman">&bull; a full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling</span>
     <a name="index-GTD_002c-Getting-Things-Done-3"></a><span class="roman">&bull; an environment to implement David Allen's GTD system</span>
     <span class="roman">&bull; a basic database application</span>
     <span class="roman">&bull; a simple hypertext system, with HTML and LaTeX export</span>
     <span class="roman">&bull; a publishing tool to create a set of interlinked webpages</span>
</pre>
   <p>Org's automatic, context-sensitive table editor with spreadsheet
capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by activating the
minor Orgtbl mode.  Using a translation step, it can be used to maintain
tables in arbitrary file types, for example in LaTeX.  The structure
editing and list creation capabilities can be used outside Org with
the minor Orgstruct mode.

   <p><a name="index-FAQ-4"></a>There is a website for Org which provides links to the newest
version of Org, as well as additional information, frequently asked
questions (FAQ), links to tutorials, etc.  This page is located at
