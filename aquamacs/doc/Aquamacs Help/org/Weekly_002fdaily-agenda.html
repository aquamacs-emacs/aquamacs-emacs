<h4 class="subsection">10.3.1 The weekly/daily agenda</h4>

<p><a name="index-agenda-739"></a><a name="index-weekly-agenda-740"></a><a name="index-daily-agenda-741"></a>
The purpose of the weekly/daily <em>agenda</em> is to act like a page of a
paper agenda, showing all the tasks for the current week or day.

     
<a name="index-org_002dagenda_002c-command-742"></a>
<a name="index-C_002dc-a-a-743"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>C-c a a</kbd><dd><a name="index-org_002dagenda_002dndays-744"></a>Compile an agenda for the current week from a list of Org files.  The agenda
shows the entries for each day.  With a numeric prefix<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  (like <kbd>C-u 2 1
C-c a a</kbd>) you may set the number of days to be displayed (see also the
variable <code>org-agenda-ndays</code>)
</dl>

   <p>Remote editing from the agenda buffer means, for example, that you can
change the dates of deadlines and appointments from the agenda buffer. 
The commands available in the Agenda buffer are listed in <a href="Agenda-commands.html#Agenda-commands">Agenda commands</a>.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Calendar/Diary integration</h5>

<p><a name="index-calendar-integration-745"></a><a name="index-diary-integration-746"></a>
Emacs contains the calendar and diary by Edward M. Reingold.  The
calendar displays a three-month calendar with holidays from different
countries and cultures.  The diary allows you to keep track of
anniversaries, lunar phases, sunrise/set, recurrent appointments
(weekly, monthly) and more.  In this way, it is quite complementary to
Org.  It can be very useful to combine output from Org with
the diary.

   <p>In order to include entries from the Emacs diary into Org mode's
agenda, you only need to customize the variable

<pre class="lisp">     (setq org-agenda-include-diary t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After that, everything will happen automatically.  All diary
entries including holidays, anniversaries, etc., will be included in the
agenda buffer created by Org mode.  &lt;SPC&gt;, &lt;TAB&gt;, and
&lt;RET&gt; can be used from the agenda buffer to jump to the diary
file in order to edit existing diary entries.  The <kbd>i</kbd> command to
insert new entries for the current date works in the agenda buffer, as
well as the commands <kbd>S</kbd>, <kbd>M</kbd>, and <kbd>C</kbd> to display
Sunrise/Sunset times, show lunar phases and to convert to other
calendars, respectively.  <kbd>c</kbd> can be used to switch back and forth
between calendar and agenda.

   <p>If you are using the diary only for sexp entries and holidays, it is
faster to not use the above setting, but instead to copy or even move
the entries into an Org file. Org mode evaluates diary-style sexp
entries, and does it faster because there is no overhead for first
creating the diary display.  Note that the sexp entries must start at
the left margin, no whitespace is allowed before them.  For example,
the following segment of an Org file will be processed and entries
will be made in the agenda:

<pre class="example">     * Birthdays and similar stuff
     #+CATEGORY: Holiday
     %%(org-calendar-holiday)   ; special function for holiday names
     #+CATEGORY: Ann
     %%(diary-anniversary 14  5 1956) Arthur Dent is %d years old
     %%(diary-anniversary  2 10 1869) Mahatma Gandhi would be %d years old
</pre>
   <h5 class="subsubheading">Anniversaries from BBDB</h5>

<p><a name="index-BBDB_002c-anniversaries-747"></a><a name="index-anniversaries_002c-from-BBDB-748"></a>
If you are using the Big Brothers Database to store your contacts, you will
very likely prefer to store anniversaries in BBDB rather than in a
separate Org or diary file.  Org supports this and will show BBDB
anniversaries as part of the agenda.  All you need to do is to add the
following to one your your agenda files:

<pre class="example">     * Anniversaries
       :PROPERTIES:
       :CATEGORY: Anniv
       :END
     %%(org-bbdb-anniversaries)
</pre>
   <p>You can then go ahead and define anniversaries for a BBDB record.  Basically,
you need to press <kbd>C-o anniversary &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> with the cursor in a BBDB
record and then add the date in the format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>, followed by a
space and the class of the anniversary (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">birthday</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wedding</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
a format string).  If you omit the class, it will default to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">birthday</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Here are a few examples, the header for the file <samp><span class="file">org-bbdb.el</span></samp> contains
more detailed information.

<pre class="example">     1973-06-22
     1955-08-02 wedding
     2008-04-14 %s released version 6.01 of org-mode, %d years ago
</pre>
   <p>After a change to BBDB, or for the first agenda display during an Emacs
session, the agenda display will suffer a short delay as Org updates its
hash with anniversaries.  However, from then on things will be very fast&mdash;much
faster in fact than a long list of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%(diary-anniversary)</span></samp>&rsquo; entries
in an Org or Diary file.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Appointment reminders</h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bappt_002eel_007d-749"></a><a name="index-appointment-reminders-750"></a>
Org can interact with Emacs appointments notification facility.  To add all
the appointments of your agenda files, use the command
<code>org-agenda-to-appt</code>.  This command also lets you filter through the
list of your appointments and add only those belonging to a specific category
or matching a regular expression. See the docstring for details.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> For backward
compatibility, the universal prefix <kbd>C-u</kbd> causes all TODO entries to be
listed before the agenda.  This feature is deprecated, use the dedicated TODO
list, or a block agenda instead (see <a href="Block-agenda.html#Block-agenda">Block agenda</a>).</p>
