<h4 class="subsection">8.3.2 Repeated tasks</h4>

<p><a name="index-tasks_002c-repeated-612"></a><a name="index-repeated-tasks-613"></a>
Some tasks need to be repeated again and again.  Org mode helps to
organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a DEADLINE, SCHEDULED,
or plain timestamp.  In the following example
<pre class="example">     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: &lt;2005-10-01 Sat +1m&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the <code>+1m</code> is a repeater; the intended interpretation is that the task
has a deadline on &lt;2005-10-01&gt; and repeats itself every (one) month starting
from that time.  If you need both a repeater and a special warning period in
a deadline entry, the repeater should come first and the warning period last:
<code>DEADLINE: &lt;2005-10-01 Sat +1m -3d&gt;</code>.

   <p>Deadlines and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when they
are over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry as
completed once you have done so.  When you mark a DEADLINE or a SCHEDULE
with the TODO keyword DONE, it will no longer produce entries in the
agenda.  The problem with this is, however, that then also the
<em>next</em> instance of the repeated entry will not be active.  Org mode
deals with this in the following way: When you try to mark such an entry
DONE (using <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd>), it will shift the base date of the repeating
timestamp by the repeater interval, and immediately set the entry state
back to TODO.  In the example above, setting the state to DONE would
actually switch the date like this:

<pre class="example">     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: &lt;2005-11-01 Tue +1m&gt;
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-org_002dlog_002drepeat-614"></a>A timestamp<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> will be added under the deadline, to keep
a record that you actually acted on the previous instance of this deadline.

   <p>As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry will no longer be
visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all future instances
will be visible.

   <p>With the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+1m</span></samp>&rsquo; cookie, the date shift will always be exactly one
month.  So if you have not paid the rent for three months, marking this
entry DONE will still keep it as an overdue deadline.  Depending on the
task, this may not be the best way to handle it.  For example, if you
forgot to call you father for 3 weeks, it does not make sense to call
him 3 times in a single day to make up for it.  Finally, there are tasks
like changing batteries which should always repeat a certain time
<i>after</i> the last time you did it.  For these tasks, Org mode has
special repeaters markers with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">++</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.+</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For example:

<pre class="example">     ** TODO Call Father
        DEADLINE: &lt;2008-02-10 Sun ++1w&gt;
        Marking this DONE will shift the date by at least one week,
        but also by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into
        the future.  However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called
        and marked it done on Saturday.
     ** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
        DEADLINE: &lt;2005-11-01 Tue .+1m&gt;
        Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after
        today.
</pre>
   <p>You may have both scheduling and deadline information for a specific
task&mdash;just make sure that the repeater intervals on both are the same.

   <p>An alternative to using a repeater is to create a number of copies of a task
subtree, with dates shifted in each copy.  The command <kbd>C-c C-x c</kbd> was
created for this purpose, it is described in <a href="Structure-editing.html#Structure-editing">Structure editing</a>.

<code>org-log-repeat</code>, or the <code>#+STARTUP</code> options <code>logrepeat</code>,
<code>lognoterepeat</code>, and <code>nologrepeat</code>.  With <code>lognoterepeat</code>, you
will also be prompted for a note.</p>
