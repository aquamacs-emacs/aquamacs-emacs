If you find problems with Org, or if you have questions, remarks, or ideas
about it, please mail to the Org mailing list <a href="mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org">emacs-orgmode@gnu.org</a>. 
If you are not a member of the mailing list, your mail will be passed to the
list after a moderator has approved it.

   <p>For bug reports, please provide as much information as possible, including
the version information of Emacs (<kbd>M-x emacs-version &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>) and Org
(<kbd>M-x org-version &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>), as well as the Org related setup in
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>.  The easiest way to do this is to use the command
<pre class="example">     <kbd>M-x org-submit-bug-report</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which will put all this information into an Emacs mail buffer so
that you only need to add your description.  If you re not sending the Email
from within Emacs, please copy and paste the content into your Email program.

   <p>If an error occurs, a backtrace can be very useful (see below on how to
create one).  Often a small example file helps, along with clear information
about:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>What exactly did you do? 
<li>What did you expect to happen? 
<li>What happened instead?
        </ol>
Thank you for helping to improve this mode.

<h5 class="subsubheading">How to create a useful backtrace</h5>

<p><a name="index-backtrace-of-an-error-17"></a>If working with Org produces an error with a message you don't
understand, you may have hit a bug.  The best way to report this is by
providing, in addition to what was mentioned above, a <em>backtrace</em>. 
This is information from the built-in debugger about where and how the
error occurred.  Here is how to produce a useful backtrace:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Reload uncompiled versions of all Org-mode Lisp files.  The backtrace
contains much more information if it is produced with uncompiled code. 
To do this, use
     <pre class="example">          C-u M-x org-reload RET
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">or select <code>Org -&gt; Refresh/Reload -&gt; Reload Org uncompiled</code> from the
menu. 
<li>Go to the <code>Options</code> menu and select <code>Enter Debugger on Error</code>
(XEmacs has this option in the <code>Troubleshooting</code> sub-menu). 
<li>Do whatever you have to do to hit the error.  Don't forget to
document the steps you take. 
<li>When you hit the error, a <samp><span class="file">*Backtrace*</span></samp> buffer will appear on the
screen.  Save this buffer to a file (for example using <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd>) and
attach it to your bug report.
        </ol>
