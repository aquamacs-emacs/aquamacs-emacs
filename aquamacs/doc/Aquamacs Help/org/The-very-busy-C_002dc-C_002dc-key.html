The key <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> has many purposes in Org, which are all
mentioned scattered throughout this manual.  One specific function of
this key is to add <em>tags</em> to a headline (see <a href="Tags.html#Tags">Tags</a>).  In many
other circumstances it means something like <em>&ldquo;Hey Org, look
here and update according to what you see here&rdquo;</em>.  Here is a summary of
what this means in different contexts.

     <ul>
<li>If there are highlights in the buffer from the creation of a sparse
tree, or from clock display, remove these highlights. 
<li>If the cursor is in one of the special <code>#+KEYWORD</code> lines, this
triggers scanning the buffer for these lines and updating the
information. 
<li>If the cursor is inside a table, realign the table.  This command
works even if the automatic table editor has been turned off. 
<li>If the cursor is on a <code>#+TBLFM</code> line, re-apply the formulas to
the entire table. 
<li>If the cursor is inside a table created by the <samp><span class="file">table.el</span></samp> package,
activate that table. 
<li>If the current buffer is a Remember buffer, close the note and file it. 
With a prefix argument, file it, without further interaction, to the
default location. 
<li>If the cursor is on a <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;target&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, update radio targets and
corresponding links in this buffer. 
<li>If the cursor is in a property line or at the start or end of a property
drawer, offer property commands. 
<li>If the cursor is at a footnote reference, go to the corresponding
definition, and vice versa. 
<li>If the cursor is on a statistics cookie, update it. 
<li>If the cursor is in a plain list item with a checkbox, toggle the status
of the checkbox. 
<li>If the cursor is on a numbered item in a plain list, renumber the
ordered list. 
<li>If the cursor is on the <code>#+BEGIN</code> line of a dynamic block, the
block is updated. 
</ul>
