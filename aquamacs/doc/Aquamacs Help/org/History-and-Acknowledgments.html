  <h2 class="appendix">Appendix C History and acknowledgments</h2>

  <p><a name="index-acknowledgments-1956" id=
  "index-acknowledgments-1956"></a><a name="index-history-1957" id=
  "index-history-1957"></a><a name="index-thanks-1958" id=
  "index-thanks-1958"></a> Org was born in 2003, out of frustration
  over the user interface of the Emacs Outline mode. I was trying
  to organize my notes and projects, and using Emacs seemed to be
  the natural way to go. However, having to remember eleven
  different commands with two or three keys per command, only to
  hide and show parts of the outline tree, that seemed entirely
  unacceptable to me. Also, when using outlines to take notes, I
  constantly wanted to restructure the tree, organizing it parallel
  to my thoughts and plans. <em>Visibility cycling</em> and
  <em>structure editing</em> were originally implemented in the
  package <samp><span class="file">outline-magic.el</span></samp>,
  but quickly moved to the more general <samp><span class=
  "file">org.el</span></samp>. As this environment became
  comfortable for project planning, the next step was adding
  <em>TODO entries</em>, basic <em>timestamps</em>, and <em>table
  support</em>. These areas highlighted the two main goals that Org
  still has today: to be a new, outline-based, plain text mode with
  innovative and intuitive editing features, and to incorporate
  project planning functionality directly into a notes file.</p>

  <p>Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me
  or to <a href=
  "mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org">emacs-orgmode@gnu.org</a> have
  provided a constant stream of bug reports, feedback, new ideas,
  and sometimes patches and add-on code. Many thanks to everyone
  who has helped to improve this package. I am trying to keep here
  a list of the people who had significant influence in shaping one
  or more aspects of Org. The list may not be complete, if I have
  forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and let me
  know.</p>

  <p>Before I get to this list, a few special mentions are in
  order:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt class="c1">Bastien Guerry</dt>

    <dd>Bastien has written a large number of extensions to Org
    (most of them integrated into the core by now), including the
    LaTeX exporter and the plain list parser. His support during
    the early days, when he basically acted as co-maintainer, was
    central to the success of this project. Bastien also invented
    Worg, helped establishing the Web presence of Org, and sponsors
    hosting costs for the orgmode.org website.<br /></dd>

    <dt class="c1">Eric Schulte and Dan Davison</dt>

    <dd>Eric and Dan are jointly responsible for the Org-babel
    system, which turns Org into a multi-language environment for
    evaluating code and doing literate programming and reproducible
    research.<br /></dd>

    <dt class="c1">John Wiegley</dt>

    <dd>John has contributed a number of great ideas and patches
    directly to Org, including the attachment system
    (<samp><span class="file">org-attach.el</span></samp>),
    integration with Apple Mail (<samp><span class=
    "file">org-mac-message.el</span></samp>), hierarchical
    dependencies of TODO items, habit tracking (<samp><span class=
    "file">org-habits.el</span></samp>), and encryption
    (<samp><span class="file">org-crypt.el</span></samp>). Also,
    the capture system is really an extended copy of his great
    <samp><span class="file">remember.el</span></samp>.<br /></dd>

    <dt class="c1">Sebastian Rose</dt>

    <dd>Without Sebastian, the HTML/XHTML publishing of Org would
    be the pitiful work of an ignorant amateur. Sebastian has
    pushed this part of Org onto a much higher level. He also wrote
    <samp><span class="file">org-info.js</span></samp>, a Java
    script for displaying webpages derived from Org using an
    Info-like or a folding interface with single-key
    navigation.</dd>
