<h2 class="appendix">Appendix C History and Acknowledgments</h2>

<p><a name="index-acknowledgements-1465"></a><a name="index-history-1466"></a><a name="index-thanks-1467"></a>
Org was born in 2003, out of frustration over the user interface
of the Emacs Outline mode.  I was trying to organize my notes and
projects, and using Emacs seemed to be the natural way to go.  However,
having to remember eleven different commands with two or three keys per
command, only to hide and show parts of the outline tree, that seemed
entirely unacceptable to me.  Also, when using outlines to take notes, I
constantly wanted to restructure the tree, organizing it parallel to my
thoughts and plans.  <em>Visibility cycling</em> and <em>structure
editing</em> were originally implemented in the package
<samp><span class="file">outline-magic.el</span></samp>, but quickly moved to the more general
<samp><span class="file">org.el</span></samp>.  As this environment became comfortable for project
planning, the next step was adding <em>TODO entries</em>, basic
<em>timestamps</em>, and <em>table support</em>.  These areas highlighted the two main
goals that Org still has today: to be a new, outline-based,
plain text mode with innovative and intuitive editing features, and to
incorporate project planning functionality directly into a notes file.

   <p>A special thanks goes to <i>Bastien Guerry</i> who has not only written a large
number of extensions to Org (most of them integrated into the core by now),
but who has also helped in the development and maintenance of Org so much that he
should be considered the main co-contributor to this package.

   <p>Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me or to
<a href="mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org">emacs-orgmode@gnu.org</a> have provided a constant stream of bug
reports, feedback, new ideas, and sometimes patches and add-on code. 
Many thanks to everyone who has helped to improve this package.  I am
trying to keep here a list of the people who had significant influence
in shaping one or more aspects of Org.  The list may not be
complete, if I have forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and
let me know.

     <ul>
<li><i>Russel Adams</i> came up with the idea for drawers. 
<li><i>Thomas Baumann</i> wrote <samp><span class="file">org-bbdb.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">org-mhe.el</span></samp>. 
<li><i>Christophe Bataillon</i> created the great unicorn logo that we use on the
Org-mode website. 
<li><i>Alex Bochannek</i> provided a patch for rounding timestamps. 
<li><i>Brad Bozarth</i> showed how to pull RSS feed data into Org-mode files. 
<li><i>Tom Breton</i> wrote <samp><span class="file">org-choose.el</span></samp>. 
<li><i>Charles Cave</i>'s suggestion sparked the implementation of templates
for Remember. 
<li><i>Pavel Chalmoviansky</i> influenced the agenda treatment of items with
specified time. 
<li><i>Gregory Chernov</i> patched support for Lisp forms into table
calculations and improved XEmacs compatibility, in particular by porting
<samp><span class="file">nouline.el</span></samp> to XEmacs. 
<li><i>Sacha Chua</i> suggested copying some linking code from Planner. 
<li><i>Baoqiu Cui</i> contributed the DocBook exporter. 
<li><i>Dan Davison</i> wrote (together with <i>Eric Schulte</i>) Org Babel. 
<li><i>Eddward DeVilla</i> proposed and tested checkbox statistics.  He also
came up with the idea of properties, and that there should be an API for
them. 
<li><i>Nick Dokos</i> tracked down several nasty bugs. 
<li><i>Kees Dullemond</i> used to edit projects lists directly in HTML and so
inspired some of the early development, including HTML export.  He also
asked for a way to narrow wide table columns. 
<li><i>Christian Egli</i> converted the documentation into Texinfo format,
patched CSS formatting into the HTML exporter, and inspired the agenda. 
<li><i>David Emery</i> provided a patch for custom CSS support in exported
HTML agendas. 
<li><i>Nic Ferrier</i> contributed mailcap and XOXO support. 
<li><i>Miguel A. Figueroa-Villanueva</i> implemented hierarchical checkboxes. 
<li><i>John Foerch</i> figured out how to make incremental search show context
around a match in a hidden outline tree. 
<li><i>Raimar Finken</i> wrote <samp><span class="file">org-git-line.el</span></samp>. 
<li><i>Mikael Fornius</i> works as a mailing list moderator. 
<li><i>Austin Frank</i> works as a mailing list moderator. 
<li><i>Niels Giesen</i> had the idea to automatically archive DONE trees. 
<li><i>Bastien Guerry</i> wrote the LaTeX exporter and <samp><span class="file">org-bibtex.el</span></samp>, and
has been prolific with patches, ideas, and bug reports. 
<li><i>Kai Grossjohann</i> pointed out key-binding conflicts with other packages. 
<li><i>Bernt Hansen</i> has driven much of the support for auto-repeating tasks,
task state change logging, and the clocktable.  His clear explanations have
been critical when we started to adopt the Git version control system. 
<li><i>Manuel Hermenegildo</i> has contributed various ideas, small fixes and
patches. 
<li><i>Phil Jackson</i> wrote <samp><span class="file">org-irc.el</span></samp>. 
<li><i>Scott Jaderholm</i> proposed footnotes, control over whitespace between
folded entries, and column view for properties. 
<li><i>Tokuya Kameshima</i> wrote <samp><span class="file">org-wl.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">org-mew.el</span></samp>. 
<li><i>Shidai Liu</i> ("Leo") asked for embedded LaTeX and tested it.  He also
provided frequent feedback and some patches. 
<li><i>Matt Lundin</i> has proposed last-row references for table formulas and named
invisible anchors.  He has also worked a lot on the FAQ. 
<li><i>Jason F. McBrayer</i> suggested agenda export to CSV format. 
<li><i>Max Mikhanosha</i> came up with the idea of refiling.

and being able to quickly restrict the agenda to a subtree. 
<li><i>Todd Neal</i> provided patches for links to Info files and Elisp forms. 
<li><i>Greg Newman</i> refreshed the unicorn logo into its current form. 
<li><i>Tim O'Callaghan</i> suggested in-file links, search options for general
file links, and TAGS. 
<li><i>Takeshi Okano</i> translated the manual and David O'Toole's tutorial
into Japanese. 
<li><i>Oliver Oppitz</i> suggested multi-state TODO items. 
<li><i>Scott Otterson</i> sparked the introduction of descriptive text for
links, among other things. 
<li><i>Pete Phillips</i> helped during the development of the TAGS feature, and
provided frequent feedback. 
<li><i>Martin Pohlack</i> provided the code snippet to bundle character insertion
into bundles of 20 for undo. 
<li><i>T.V. Raman</i> reported bugs and suggested improvements. 
<li><i>Matthias Rempe</i> (Oelde) provided ideas, Windows support, and quality
control.

webpages derived from Org using an Info-like or a folding interface with
single-key navigation. 
<li><i>Frank Ruell</i> solved the mystery of the <code>keymapp nil</code> bug, a
conflict with <samp><span class="file">allout.el</span></samp>. 
<li><i>Jason Riedy</i> generalized the send-receive mechanism for Orgtbl tables with
extensive patches. 
<li><i>Philip Rooke</i> created the Org reference card, provided lots
of feedback, developed and applied standards to the Org documentation. 
<li><i>Christian Schlauer</i> proposed angular brackets around links, among
other things. 
<li><i>Eric Schulte</i> wrote <samp><span class="file">org-plot.el</span></samp> and (together with <i>Dan Davison</i>)
Org Babel, and contributed various patches, small features and modules. 
<li>Linking to VM/BBDB/Gnus was first inspired by <i>Tom Shannon</i>'s
<samp><span class="file">organizer-mode.el</span></samp>. 
<li><i>Ilya Shlyakhter</i> proposed the Archive Sibling, line numbering in literal
examples, and remote highlighting for referenced code lines.

subtrees. 
<li><i>Dale Smith</i> proposed link abbreviations. 
<li><i>James TD Smith</i> has contributed a large number of patches for useful
tweaks and features. 
<li><i>Adam Spiers</i> asked for global linking commands, inspired the link
extension system, added support for mairix, and proposed the mapping API. 
<li><i>Andy Stewart</i> contributed code to <samp><span class="file">org-w3m.el</span></samp>, to copy HTML content
with links transformation to Org syntax. 
<li><i>David O'Toole</i> wrote <samp><span class="file">org-publish.el</span></samp> and drafted the manual
chapter about publishing. 
<li><i>J&uuml;rgen Vollmer</i> contributed code generating the table of contents
in HTML output. 
<li><i>Chris Wallace</i> provided a patch implementing the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">QUOTE</span></samp>&rsquo;
keyword. 
<li><i>David Wainberg</i> suggested archiving, and improvements to the linking
system. 
<li><i>John Wiegley</i> wrote <samp><span class="file">emacs-wiki.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">planner.el</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="file">muse.el</span></samp>, which have some overlap with Org.  Initially the development
of Org was fully independent because I was not aware of the existence of
these packages.  But with time I have occasionally looked at John's code and
learned a lot from it.  John has also contributed a number of great ideas and
patches directly to Org, including the attachment system
(<samp><span class="file">org-attach.el</span></samp>), integration with Apple Mail
(<samp><span class="file">org-mac-message.el</span></samp>), hierarchical dependencies of TODO items, habit
tracking (<samp><span class="file">org-habits.el</span></samp>) and support for pcomplete. 
<li><i>Carsten Wimmer</i> suggested some changes and helped fix a bug in
linking to Gnus. 
<li><i>Roland Winkler</i> requested additional key bindings to make Org
work on a tty. 
<li><i>Piotr Zielinski</i> wrote <samp><span class="file">org-mouse.el</span></samp>, proposed agenda blocks
and contributed various ideas and code snippets.
