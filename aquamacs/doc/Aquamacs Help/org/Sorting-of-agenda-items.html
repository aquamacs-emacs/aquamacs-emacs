<h4 class="subsection">10.4.3 Sorting of agenda items</h4>

<p><a name="index-sorting_002c-of-agenda-items-796"></a><a name="index-priorities_002c-of-agenda-items-797"></a>Before being inserted into a view, the items are sorted.  How this is
done depends on the type of view.
     <ul>
<li><a name="index-org_002dagenda_002dfiles-798"></a>For the daily/weekly agenda, the items for each day are sorted.  The
default order is to first collect all items containing an explicit
time-of-day specification.  These entries will be shown at the beginning
of the list, as a <em>schedule</em> for the day.  After that, items remain
grouped in categories, in the sequence given by <code>org-agenda-files</code>. 
Within each category, items are sorted by priority (see <a href="Priorities.html#Priorities">Priorities</a>),
which is composed of the base priority (2000 for priority &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;, 1000
for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;, and 0 for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;), plus additional increments for
overdue scheduled or deadline items. 
<li>For the TODO list, items remain in the order of categories, but within
each category, sorting takes place according to priority
(see <a href="Priorities.html#Priorities">Priorities</a>).  The priority used for sorting derives from the
priority cookie, with additions depending on how close an item is to its due
or scheduled date. 
<li>For tags matches, items are not sorted at all, but just appear in the
sequence in which they are found in the agenda files. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-org_002dagenda_002dsorting_002dstrategy-799"></a>Sorting can be customized using the variable
<code>org-agenda-sorting-strategy</code>, and may also include criteria based on
the estimated effort of an entry (see <a href="Effort-estimates.html#Effort-estimates">Effort estimates</a>).
