<h3 class="section">A.10 Using the mapping API</h3>

<p><a name="index-API_002c-for-mapping-1452"></a><a name="index-mapping-entries_002c-API-1453"></a>
Org has sophisticated mapping capabilities to find all entries satisfying
certain criteria.  Internally, this functionality is used to produce agenda
views, but there is also an API that can be used to execute arbitrary
functions for each or selected entries.  The main entry point for this API
is:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>org-map-entries</b><var> func &amp;optional match scope &amp;rest skip<a name="index-org_002dmap_002dentries-1454"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Call FUNC at each headline selected by MATCH in SCOPE.

        <p>FUNC is a function or a Lisp form.  The function will be called without
arguments, with the cursor positioned at the beginning of the headline. 
The return values of all calls to the function will be collected and
returned as a list.

        <p>The call to FUNC will be wrapped into a save-excursion form, so FUNC
does not need to preserve point.  After evaluation, the cursor will be
moved to the end of the line (presumably of the headline of the
processed entry) and search continues from there.  Under some
circumstances, this may not produce the wanted results.  For example,
if you have removed (e.g. archived) the current (sub)tree it could
mean that the next entry will be skipped entirely.  In such cases, you
can specify the position from where search should continue by making
FUNC set the variable `org-map-continue-from' to the desired buffer
position.

        <p>MATCH is a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda match view. 
Only headlines that are matched by this query will be considered during
the iteration.  When MATCH is nil or t, all headlines will be
visited by the iteration.

        <p>SCOPE determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:

     <pre class="example">          nil     <span class="roman">the current buffer, respecting the restriction if any</span>
          tree    <span class="roman">the subtree started with the entry at point</span>
          file    <span class="roman">the current buffer, without restriction</span>
          file-with-archives
                  <span class="roman">the current buffer, and any archives associated with it</span>
          agenda  <span class="roman">all agenda files</span>
          agenda-with-archives
                  <span class="roman">all agenda files with any archive files associated with them</span>
          (file1 file2 ...)
                  <span class="roman">if this is a list, all files in the list will be scanned</span>
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">The remaining args are treated as settings for the skipping facilities of
the scanner.  The following items can be given here:

        <p><a name="index-org_002dagenda_002dskip_002dfunction-1455"></a>
     <pre class="example">          archive   <span class="roman">skip trees with the archive tag</span>
          comment   <span class="roman">skip trees with the COMMENT keyword</span>
          function or Lisp form
                    <span class="roman">will be used as value for </span><code>org-agenda-skip-function</code><span class="roman">,</span>
                    <span class="roman">so whenever the function returns t, FUNC</span>
                    <span class="roman">will not be called for that entry and search will</span>
                    <span class="roman">continue from the point where the function leaves it</span>
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>The function given to that mapping routine can really do anything you like. 
It can use the property API (see <a href="Using-the-property-API.html#Using-the-property-API">Using the property API</a>) to gather more
information about the entry, or in order to change metadata in the entry. 
Here are a couple of functions that might be handy:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>org-todo</b><var> &amp;optional arg<a name="index-org_002dtodo-1456"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Change the TODO state of the entry, see the docstring of the functions for
the many possible values for the argument ARG. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>org-priority</b><var> &amp;optional action<a name="index-org_002dpriority-1457"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Change the priority of the entry, see the docstring of this function for the
possible values for ACTION. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>org-toggle-tag</b><var> tag &amp;optional onoff<a name="index-org_002dtoggle_002dtag-1458"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Toggle the tag TAG in the current entry.  Setting ONOFF to either <code>on</code>
or <code>off</code> will not toggle tag, but ensure that it is either on or off. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>org-promote</b><var><a name="index-org_002dpromote-1459"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Promote the current entry. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>org-demote</b><var><a name="index-org_002ddemote-1460"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Demote the current entry. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Here is a simple example that will turn all entries in the current file with
a tag <code>TOMORROW</code> into TODO entries with the keyword <code>UPCOMING</code>. 
Entries in comment trees and in archive trees will be ignored.

<pre class="lisp">     (org-map-entries
        '(org-todo "UPCOMING")
        "+TOMORROW" 'file 'archive 'comment)
</pre>
   <p>The following example counts the number of entries with TODO keyword
<code>WAITING</code>, in all agenda files.

<pre class="lisp">     (length (org-map-entries t "/+WAITING" 'agenda))
</pre>
   </body></html>
