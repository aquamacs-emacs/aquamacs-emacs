<h3 class="section">21.9 Special Events</h3>

<p><a name="index-special-events-1376"></a>Special events are handled at a very low level&mdash;as soon as they are
read.  The <code>read-event</code> function processes these events itself, and
never returns them.  Instead, it keeps waiting for the first event
that is not special and returns that one.

   <p>Events that are handled in this way do not echo, they are never grouped
into key sequences, and they never appear in the value of
<code>last-command-event</code> or <code>(this-command-keys)</code>.  They do not
discard a numeric argument, they cannot be unread with
<code>unread-command-events</code>, they may not appear in a keyboard macro,
and they are not recorded in a keyboard macro while you are defining
one.

   <p>These events do, however, appear in <code>last-input-event</code> immediately
after they are read, and this is the way for the event's definition to
find the actual event.

   <p>The events types <code>iconify-frame</code>, <code>make-frame-visible</code>,
<code>delete-frame</code>, <code>drag-n-drop</code>, and user signals like
<code>sigusr1</code> are normally handled in this way.  The keymap which
defines how to handle special events&mdash;and which events are special&mdash;is
in the variable <code>special-event-map</code> (see <a href="Active-Keymaps.html#Active-Keymaps">Active Keymaps</a>).
