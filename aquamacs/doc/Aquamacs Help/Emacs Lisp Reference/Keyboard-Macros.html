<h3 class="section">21.16 Keyboard Macros</h3>

<p><a name="index-keyboard-macros-1422"></a>
  A <dfn>keyboard macro</dfn> is a canned sequence of input events that can
be considered a command and made the definition of a key.  The Lisp
representation of a keyboard macro is a string or vector containing the
events.  Don't confuse keyboard macros with Lisp macros
(see <a href="Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>execute-kbd-macro</b><var> kbdmacro &amp;optional count loopfunc<a name="index-execute_002dkbd_002dmacro-1423"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function executes <var>kbdmacro</var> as a sequence of events.  If
<var>kbdmacro</var> is a string or vector, then the events in it are executed
exactly as if they had been input by the user.  The sequence is
<em>not</em> expected to be a single key sequence; normally a keyboard
macro definition consists of several key sequences concatenated.

        <p>If <var>kbdmacro</var> is a symbol, then its function definition is used in
place of <var>kbdmacro</var>.  If that is another symbol, this process repeats. 
Eventually the result should be a string or vector.  If the result is
not a symbol, string, or vector, an error is signaled.

        <p>The argument <var>count</var> is a repeat count; <var>kbdmacro</var> is executed that
many times.  If <var>count</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, <var>kbdmacro</var> is
executed once.  If it is 0, <var>kbdmacro</var> is executed over and over until it
encounters an error or a failing search.

        <p>If <var>loopfunc</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it is a function that is called,
without arguments, prior to each iteration of the macro.  If
<var>loopfunc</var> returns <code>nil</code>, then this stops execution of the macro.

        <p>See <a href="Reading-One-Event.html#Reading-One-Event">Reading One Event</a>, for an example of using <code>execute-kbd-macro</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>executing-kbd-macro</b><var><a name="index-executing_002dkbd_002dmacro-1424"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable contains the string or vector that defines the keyboard
macro that is currently executing.  It is <code>nil</code> if no macro is
currently executing.  A command can test this variable so as to behave
differently when run from an executing macro.  Do not set this variable
yourself. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>defining-kbd-macro</b><var><a name="index-defining_002dkbd_002dmacro-1425"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable is non-<code>nil</code> if and only if a keyboard macro is
being defined.  A command can test this variable so as to behave
differently while a macro is being defined.  The value is
<code>append</code> while appending to the definition of an existing macro. 
The commands <code>start-kbd-macro</code>, <code>kmacro-start-macro</code> and
<code>end-kbd-macro</code> set this variable&mdash;do not set it yourself.

        <p>The variable is always local to the current terminal and cannot be
buffer-local.  See <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html#Multiple-Terminals">Multiple Terminals</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>last-kbd-macro</b><var><a name="index-last_002dkbd_002dmacro-1426"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable is the definition of the most recently defined keyboard
macro.  Its value is a string or vector, or <code>nil</code>.

        <p>The variable is always local to the current terminal and cannot be
buffer-local.  See <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html#Multiple-Terminals">Multiple Terminals</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>kbd-macro-termination-hook</b><var><a name="index-kbd_002dmacro_002dtermination_002dhook-1427"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This normal hook (see <a href="Standard-Hooks.html#Standard-Hooks">Standard Hooks</a>) is run when a keyboard
macro terminates, regardless of what caused it to terminate (reaching
the macro end or an error which ended the macro prematurely). 
</p></blockquote></div>
