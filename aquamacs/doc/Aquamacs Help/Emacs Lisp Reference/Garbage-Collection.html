<h3 class="appendixsec">E.3 Garbage Collection</h3>

<p><a name="index-garbage-collection-3861"></a>
<a name="index-memory-allocation-3862"></a>  When a program creates a list or the user defines a new function (such
as by loading a library), that data is placed in normal storage.  If
normal storage runs low, then Emacs asks the operating system to
allocate more memory in blocks of 1k bytes.  Each block is used for one
type of Lisp object, so symbols, cons cells, markers, etc., are
segregated in distinct blocks in memory.  (Vectors, long strings,
buffers and certain other editing types, which are fairly large, are
allocated in individual blocks, one per object, while small strings are
packed into blocks of 8k bytes.)

   <p>It is quite common to use some storage for a while, then release it by
(for example) killing a buffer or deleting the last pointer to an
object.  Emacs provides a <dfn>garbage collector</dfn> to reclaim this
abandoned storage.  (This name is traditional, but &ldquo;garbage recycler&rdquo;
might be a more intuitive metaphor for this facility.)

   <p>The garbage collector operates by finding and marking all Lisp objects
that are still accessible to Lisp programs.  To begin with, it assumes
all the symbols, their values and associated function definitions, and
any data presently on the stack, are accessible.  Any objects that can
be reached indirectly through other accessible objects are also
accessible.

   <p>When marking is finished, all objects still unmarked are garbage.  No
matter what the Lisp program or the user does, it is impossible to refer
to them, since there is no longer a way to reach them.  Their space
might as well be reused, since no one will miss them.  The second
(&ldquo;sweep&rdquo;) phase of the garbage collector arranges to reuse them.

<!-- ??? Maybe add something describing weak hash tables here? -->
   <p><a name="index-free-list-3863"></a>  The sweep phase puts unused cons cells onto a <dfn>free list</dfn>
for future allocation; likewise for symbols and markers.  It compacts
the accessible strings so they occupy fewer 8k blocks; then it frees the
other 8k blocks.  Vectors, buffers, windows, and other large objects are
individually allocated and freed using <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>.

   <p><a name="index-CL-note_002d_002d_002dallocate-more-storage-3864"></a><blockquote>
<b>Common Lisp note:</b> Unlike other Lisps, GNU Emacs Lisp does not
call the garbage collector when the free list is empty.  Instead, it
simply requests the operating system to allocate more storage, and
processing continues until <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> bytes have been
used.

   <p>This means that you can make sure that the garbage collector will not
run during a certain portion of a Lisp program by calling the garbage
collector explicitly just before it (provided that portion of the
program does not use so much space as to force a second garbage
collection).

&mdash; Command: <b>garbage-collect</b><var><a name="index-garbage_002dcollect-3865"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command runs a garbage collection, and returns information on
the amount of space in use.  (Garbage collection can also occur
spontaneously if you use more than <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> bytes of
Lisp data since the previous garbage collection.)

        <p><code>garbage-collect</code> returns a list containing the following
information:

     <pre class="example">          ((<var>used-conses</var> . <var>free-conses</var>)
           (<var>used-syms</var> . <var>free-syms</var>)
           (<var>used-miscs</var> . <var>free-miscs</var>)
           <var>used-string-chars</var>
           <var>used-vector-slots</var>
           (<var>used-floats</var> . <var>free-floats</var>)
           (<var>used-intervals</var> . <var>free-intervals</var>)
           (<var>used-strings</var> . <var>free-strings</var>))
</pre>
        <p>Here is an example:

     <pre class="example">          (garbage-collect)
               &rArr; ((106886 . 13184) (9769 . 0)
                          (7731 . 4651) 347543 121628
                          (31 . 94) (1273 . 168)
                          (25474 . 3569))
</pre>
        <p>Here is a table explaining each element:

          <dl>
<dt><var>used-conses</var><dd>The number of cons cells in use.

          <br><dt><var>free-conses</var><dd>The number of cons cells for which space has been obtained from the
operating system, but that are not currently being used.

          <br><dt><var>used-syms</var><dd>The number of symbols in use.

          <br><dt><var>free-syms</var><dd>The number of symbols for which space has been obtained from the
operating system, but that are not currently being used.

          <br><dt><var>used-miscs</var><dd>The number of miscellaneous objects in use.  These include markers and
overlays, plus certain objects not visible to users.

          <br><dt><var>free-miscs</var><dd>The number of miscellaneous objects for which space has been obtained
from the operating system, but that are not currently being used.

          <br><dt><var>used-string-chars</var><dd>The total size of all strings, in characters.

          <br><dt><var>used-vector-slots</var><dd>The total number of elements of existing vectors.

          <br><dt><var>used-floats</var><dd><!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
The number of floats in use.

          <br><dt><var>free-floats</var><dd><!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
The number of floats for which space has been obtained from the
operating system, but that are not currently being used.

          <br><dt><var>used-intervals</var><dd>The number of intervals in use.  Intervals are an internal
data structure used for representing text properties.

          <br><dt><var>free-intervals</var><dd>The number of intervals for which space has been obtained
from the operating system, but that are not currently being used.

          <br><dt><var>used-strings</var><dd>The number of strings in use.

          <br><dt><var>free-strings</var><dd>The number of string headers for which the space was obtained from the
operating system, but which are currently not in use.  (A string
object consists of a header and the storage for the string text
itself; the latter is only allocated when the string is created.) 
</dl>

        <p>If there was overflow in pure space (see the previous section),
<code>garbage-collect</code> returns <code>nil</code>, because a real garbage
collection can not be done in this situation.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>garbage-collection-messages</b><var><a name="index-garbage_002dcollection_002dmessages-3866"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs displays a message at the
beginning and end of garbage collection.  The default value is
<code>nil</code>, meaning there are no such messages. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>post-gc-hook</b><var><a name="index-post_002dgc_002dhook-3867"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is a normal hook that is run at the end of garbage collection. 
Garbage collection is inhibited while the hook functions run, so be
careful writing them. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>gc-cons-threshold</b><var><a name="index-gc_002dcons_002dthreshold-3868"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is the number of bytes of storage that must
be allocated for Lisp objects after one garbage collection in order to
trigger another garbage collection.  A cons cell counts as eight bytes,
a string as one byte per character plus a few bytes of overhead, and so
on; space allocated to the contents of buffers does not count.  Note
that the subsequent garbage collection does not happen immediately when
the threshold is exhausted, but only the next time the Lisp evaluator is
called.

        <p>The initial threshold value is 400,000.  If you specify a larger
value, garbage collection will happen less often.  This reduces the
amount of time spent garbage collecting, but increases total memory use. 
You may want to do this when running a program that creates lots of
Lisp data.

        <p>You can make collections more frequent by specifying a smaller value,
down to 10,000.  A value less than 10,000 will remain in effect only
until the subsequent garbage collection, at which time
<code>garbage-collect</code> will set the threshold back to 10,000. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>gc-cons-percentage</b><var><a name="index-gc_002dcons_002dpercentage-3869"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable specifies the amount of consing before a
garbage collection occurs, as a fraction of the current heap size. 
This criterion and <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> apply in parallel, and
garbage collection occurs only when both criteria are satisfied.

        <p>As the heap size increases, the time to perform a garbage collection
increases.  Thus, it can be desirable to do them less frequently in
proportion. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The value returned by <code>garbage-collect</code> describes the amount of
memory used by Lisp data, broken down by data type.  By contrast, the
function <code>memory-limit</code> provides information on the total amount of
memory Emacs is currently using.

<!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>memory-limit</b><var><a name="index-memory_002dlimit-3870"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the address of the last byte Emacs has allocated,
divided by 1024.  We divide the value by 1024 to make sure it fits in a
Lisp integer.

        <p>You can use this to get a general idea of how your actions affect the
memory usage. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>memory-full</b><var><a name="index-memory_002dfull-3871"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable is <code>t</code> if Emacs is close to out of memory for Lisp
objects, and <code>nil</code> otherwise. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>memory-use-counts</b><var><a name="index-memory_002duse_002dcounts-3872"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This returns a list of numbers that count the number of objects
created in this Emacs session.  Each of these counters increments for
a certain kind of object.  See the documentation string for details. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>gcs-done</b><var><a name="index-gcs_002ddone-3873"></a></var><br>
