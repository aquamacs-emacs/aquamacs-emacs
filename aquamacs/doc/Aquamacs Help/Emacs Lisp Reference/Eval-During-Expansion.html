<h4 class="subsection">13.6.4 Evaluating Macro Arguments in Expansion</h4>

<p>Another problem can happen if the macro definition itself
evaluates any of the macro argument expressions, such as by calling
<code>eval</code> (see <a href="Eval.html#Eval">Eval</a>).  If the argument is supposed to refer to the
user's variables, you may have trouble if the user happens to use a
variable with the same name as one of the macro arguments.  Inside the
macro body, the macro argument binding is the most local binding of this
variable, so any references inside the form being evaluated do refer to
it.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     (defmacro foo (a)
       (list 'setq (eval a) t))
          &rArr; foo
     (setq x 'b)
     (foo x) ==&gt; (setq b t)
          &rArr; t                  ; <span class="roman">and </span><code>b</code><span class="roman"> has been set.</span>
     ;; <span class="roman">but</span>
     (setq a 'c)
     (foo a) ==&gt; (setq a t)
          &rArr; t                  ; <span class="roman">but this set </span><code>a</code><span class="roman">, not </span><code>c</code><span class="roman">.</span>
</pre>
   <p>It makes a difference whether the user's variable is named <code>a</code> or
<code>x</code>, because <code>a</code> conflicts with the macro argument variable
<code>a</code>.

   <p>Another problem with calling <code>eval</code> in a macro definition is that
it probably won't do what you intend in a compiled program.  The
byte compiler runs macro definitions while compiling the program, when
the program's own computations (which you might have wished to access
with <code>eval</code>) don't occur and its local variable bindings don't
exist.

   <p>To avoid these problems, <strong>don't evaluate an argument expression
while computing the macro expansion</strong>.  Instead, substitute the
expression into the macro expansion, so that its value will be computed
as part of executing the expansion.  This is how the other examples in
this chapter work.
