<h3 class="section">15.8 Which File Defined a Certain Symbol</h3>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>symbol-file</b><var> symbol &amp;optional type<a name="index-symbol_002dfile-829"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the name of the file that defined <var>symbol</var>. 
If <var>type</var> is <code>nil</code>, then any kind of definition is acceptable. 
If <var>type</var> is <code>defun</code>, <code>defvar</code>, or <code>defface</code>, that
specifies function definition, variable definition, or face definition
only.

        <p>The value is normally an absolute file name.  It can also be <code>nil</code>,
if the definition is not associated with any file.  If <var>symbol</var>
specifies an autoloaded function, the value can be a relative file name
without extension. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The basis for <code>symbol-file</code> is the data in the variable
<code>load-history</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>load-history</b><var><a name="index-load_002dhistory-830"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is an alist that associates the names of
loaded library files with the names of the functions and variables
they defined, as well as the features they provided or required.

        <p>Each element in this alist describes one loaded library (including
libraries that are preloaded at startup).  It is a list whose <span class="sc">car</span>
is the absolute file name of the library (a string).  The rest of the
list elements have these forms:

          <dl>
<dt><var>var</var><dd>The symbol <var>var</var> was defined as a variable. 
<br><dt><code>(defun . </code><var>fun</var><code>)</code><dd>The function <var>fun</var> was defined. 
<br><dt><code>(t . </code><var>fun</var><code>)</code><dd>The function <var>fun</var> was previously an autoload before this library
redefined it as a function.  The following element is always
<code>(defun . </code><var>fun</var><code>)</code>, which represents defining <var>fun</var> as a
function. 
<br><dt><code>(autoload . </code><var>fun</var><code>)</code><dd>The function <var>fun</var> was defined as an autoload. 
<br><dt><code>(defface . </code><var>face</var><code>)</code><dd>The face <var>face</var> was defined. 
<br><dt><code>(require . </code><var>feature</var><code>)</code><dd>The feature <var>feature</var> was required. 
<br><dt><code>(provide . </code><var>feature</var><code>)</code><dd>The feature <var>feature</var> was provided. 
</dl>

        <p>The value of <code>load-history</code> may have one element whose <span class="sc">car</span> is
<code>nil</code>.  This element describes definitions made with
<code>eval-buffer</code> on a buffer that is not visiting a file. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The command <code>eval-region</code> updates <code>load-history</code>, but does so
by adding the symbols defined to the element for the file being visited,
rather than replacing that element.  See <a href="Eval.html#Eval">Eval</a>.
