<h4 class="subsection">38.4.2 Reporting Operation Progress</h4>

<p><a name="index-progress-reporting-3703"></a>
  When an operation can take a while to finish, you should inform the
user about the progress it makes.  This way the user can estimate
remaining time and clearly see that Emacs is busy working, not hung. 
A convenient way to do this is to use a <dfn>progress reporter</dfn>.

   <p>Here is a working example that does nothing useful:

<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((progress-reporter
            (make-progress-reporter "Collecting mana for Emacs..."
                                    0  500)))
       (dotimes (k 500)
         (sit-for 0.01)
         (progress-reporter-update progress-reporter k))
       (progress-reporter-done progress-reporter))
</pre>
   <div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>make-progress-reporter</b><var> message &amp;optional min-value max-value current-value min-change min-time<a name="index-make_002dprogress_002dreporter-3704"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function creates and returns a progress reporter object, which
you will use as an argument for the other functions listed below.  The
idea is to precompute as much data as possible to make progress
reporting very fast.

        <p>When this progress reporter is subsequently used, it will display
<var>message</var> in the echo area, followed by progress percentage. 
<var>message</var> is treated as a simple string.  If you need it to depend
on a filename, for instance, use <code>format</code> before calling this
function.

        <p>The arguments <var>min-value</var> and <var>max-value</var> should be numbers
standing for the starting and final states of the operation.  For
instance, an operation that &ldquo;scans&rdquo; a buffer should set these to the
results of <code>point-min</code> and <code>point-max</code> correspondingly. 
<var>max-value</var> should be greater than <var>min-value</var>.

        <p>Alternatively, you can set <var>min-value</var> and <var>max-value</var> to
<code>nil</code>.  In that case, the progress reporter does not report
process percentages; it instead displays a &ldquo;spinner&rdquo; that rotates a
notch each time you update the progress reporter.

        <p>If <var>min-value</var> and <var>max-value</var> are numbers, you can give the
argument <var>current-value</var> a numerical value specifying the initial
progress; if omitted, this defaults to <var>min-value</var>.

        <p>The remaining arguments control the rate of echo area updates.  The
progress reporter will wait for at least <var>min-change</var> more
percents of the operation to be completed before printing next
message; the default is one percent.  <var>min-time</var> specifies the
minimum time in seconds to pass between successive prints; the default
is 0.2 seconds.  (On some operating systems, the progress reporter may
handle fractions of seconds with varying precision).

        <p>This function calls <code>progress-reporter-update</code>, so the first
message is printed immediately. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>progress-reporter-update</b><var> reporter &amp;optional value<a name="index-progress_002dreporter_002dupdate-3705"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function does the main work of reporting progress of your
operation.  It displays the message of <var>reporter</var>, followed by
progress percentage determined by <var>value</var>.  If percentage is zero,
or close enough according to the <var>min-change</var> and <var>min-time</var>
arguments, then it is omitted from the output.

        <p><var>reporter</var> must be the result of a call to
<code>make-progress-reporter</code>.  <var>value</var> specifies the current
state of your operation and must be between <var>min-value</var> and
<var>max-value</var> (inclusive) as passed to
<code>make-progress-reporter</code>.  For instance, if you scan a buffer,
then <var>value</var> should be the result of a call to <code>point</code>.

        <p>This function respects <var>min-change</var> and <var>min-time</var> as passed
to <code>make-progress-reporter</code> and so does not output new messages
on every invocation.  It is thus very fast and normally you should not
try to reduce the number of calls to it: resulting overhead will most
likely negate your effort. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>progress-reporter-force-update</b><var> reporter &amp;optional value new-message<a name="index-progress_002dreporter_002dforce_002dupdate-3706"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is similar to <code>progress-reporter-update</code> except
that it prints a message in the echo area unconditionally.

        <p>The first two arguments have the same meaning as for
<code>progress-reporter-update</code>.  Optional <var>new-message</var> allows
you to change the message of the <var>reporter</var>.  Since this functions
always updates the echo area, such a change will be immediately
presented to the user. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>progress-reporter-done</b><var> reporter<a name="index-progress_002dreporter_002ddone-3707"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function should be called when the operation is finished.  It
prints the message of <var>reporter</var> followed by word &ldquo;done&rdquo; in the
echo area.

        <p>You should always call this function and not hope for
<code>progress-reporter-update</code> to print &ldquo;100%&rdquo;.  Firstly, it may
never print it, there are many good reasons for this not to happen. 
Secondly, &ldquo;done&rdquo; is more explicit. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>dotimes-with-progress-reporter</b> (<var>var count </var>[<var>result</var>])<var> message body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-dotimes_002dwith_002dprogress_002dreporter-3708"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is a convenience macro that works the same way as <code>dotimes</code>
does, but also reports loop progress using the functions described
above.  It allows you to save some typing.

        <p>You can rewrite the example in the beginning of this node using
this macro this way:

     <pre class="example">          (dotimes-with-progress-reporter
              (k 500)
              "Collecting some mana for Emacs..."
            (sit-for 0.01))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
