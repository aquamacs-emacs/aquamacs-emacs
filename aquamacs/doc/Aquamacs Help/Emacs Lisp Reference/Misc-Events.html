<h4 class="subsection">21.7.10 Miscellaneous System Events</h4>

<p>A few other event types represent occurrences within the system.

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdelete_002dframe_007d-event-1287"></a>
<dl><dt><code>(delete-frame (</code><var>frame</var><code>))</code><dd>This kind of event indicates that the user gave the window manager
a command to delete a particular window, which happens to be an Emacs frame.

     <p>The standard definition of the <code>delete-frame</code> event is to delete <var>frame</var>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007biconify_002dframe_007d-event-1288"></a><br><dt><code>(iconify-frame (</code><var>frame</var><code>))</code><dd>This kind of event indicates that the user iconified <var>frame</var> using
the window manager.  Its standard definition is <code>ignore</code>; since the
frame has already been iconified, Emacs has no work to do.  The purpose
of this event type is so that you can keep track of such events if you
want to.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmake_002dframe_002dvisible_007d-event-1289"></a><br><dt><code>(make-frame-visible (</code><var>frame</var><code>))</code><dd>This kind of event indicates that the user deiconified <var>frame</var> using
the window manager.  Its standard definition is <code>ignore</code>; since the
frame has already been made visible, Emacs has no work to do.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bwheel_002dup_007d-event-1290"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bwheel_002ddown_007d-event-1291"></a><br><dt><code>(wheel-up </code><var>position</var><code>)</code><br><dt><code>(wheel-down </code><var>position</var><code>)</code><dd>These kinds of event are generated by moving a mouse wheel.  Their
usual meaning is a kind of scroll or zoom.

     <p>The element <var>position</var> is a list describing the position of the
event, in the same format as used in a mouse-click event.

     <p><a name="index-mouse_002dwheel_002dup_002devent-1292"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dwheel_002ddown_002devent-1293"></a>This kind of event is generated only on some kinds of systems. On some
systems, <code>mouse-4</code> and <code>mouse-5</code> are used instead.  For
portable code, use the variables <code>mouse-wheel-up-event</code> and
<code>mouse-wheel-down-event</code> defined in <samp><span class="file">mwheel.el</span></samp> to determine
what event types to expect for the mouse wheel.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdrag_002dn_002ddrop_007d-event-1294"></a><br><dt><code>(drag-n-drop </code><var>position</var> <var>files</var><code>)</code><dd>This kind of event is generated when a group of files is
selected in an application outside of Emacs, and then dragged and
dropped onto an Emacs frame.

     <p>The element <var>position</var> is a list describing the position of the
event, in the same format as used in a mouse-click event, and
<var>files</var> is the list of file names that were dragged and dropped. 
The usual way to handle this event is by visiting these files.

     <p>This kind of event is generated, at present, only on some kinds of
systems.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bhelp_002decho_007d-event-1295"></a><br><dt><code>help-echo</code><dd>This kind of event is generated when a mouse pointer moves onto a
portion of buffer text which has a <code>help-echo</code> text property. 
The generated event has this form:

     <pre class="example">          (help-echo <var>frame</var> <var>help</var> <var>window</var> <var>object</var> <var>pos</var>)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The precise meaning of the event parameters and the way these
parameters are used to display the help-echo text are described in
<a href="Text-help_002decho.html#Text-help_002decho">Text help-echo</a>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsigusr1_007d-event-1296"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsigusr2_007d-event-1297"></a><a name="index-user-signals-1298"></a><br><dt><code>sigusr1</code><dt><code>sigusr2</code><dd>These events are generated when the Emacs process receives
the signals <code>SIGUSR1</code> and <code>SIGUSR2</code>.  They contain no
additional data because signals do not carry additional information.

     <p>To catch a user signal, bind the corresponding event to an interactive
command in the <code>special-event-map</code> (see <a href="Active-Keymaps.html#Active-Keymaps">Active Keymaps</a>). 
The command is called with no arguments, and the specific signal event is
available in <code>last-input-event</code>.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (defun sigusr-handler ()
            (interactive)
            (message "Caught signal %S" last-input-event))
          
          (define-key special-event-map [sigusr1] 'sigusr-handler)
</pre>
     <p>To test the signal handler, you can make Emacs send a signal to itself:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (signal-process (emacs-pid) 'sigusr1)
</pre>
     </dl>

   <p>If one of these events arrives in the middle of a key sequence&mdash;that
is, after a prefix key&mdash;then Emacs reorders the events so that this
event comes either before or after the multi-event key sequence, not
within it.
