<h3 class="section">27.6 Buffer Modification Time</h3>

<p><a name="index-comparing-file-modification-time-1996"></a><a name="index-modification-time-of-buffer-1997"></a>
  Suppose that you visit a file and make changes in its buffer, and
meanwhile the file itself is changed on disk.  At this point, saving the
buffer would overwrite the changes in the file.  Occasionally this may
be what you want, but usually it would lose valuable information.  Emacs
therefore checks the file's modification time using the functions
described below before saving the file.  (See <a href="File-Attributes.html#File-Attributes">File Attributes</a>,
for how to examine a file's modification time.)

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>verify-visited-file-modtime</b><var> buffer<a name="index-verify_002dvisited_002dfile_002dmodtime-1998"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function compares what <var>buffer</var> has recorded for the
modification time of its visited file against the actual modification
time of the file as recorded by the operating system.  The two should be
the same unless some other process has written the file since Emacs
visited or saved it.

        <p>The function returns <code>t</code> if the last actual modification time and
Emacs's recorded modification time are the same, <code>nil</code> otherwise. 
It also returns <code>t</code> if the buffer has no recorded last
modification time, that is if <code>visited-file-modtime</code> would return
zero.

        <p>It always returns <code>t</code> for buffers that are not visiting a file,
even if <code>visited-file-modtime</code> returns a non-zero value.  For
instance, it always returns <code>t</code> for dired buffers.  It returns
<code>t</code> for buffers that are visiting a file that does not exist and
never existed, but <code>nil</code> for file-visiting buffers whose file has
been deleted. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>clear-visited-file-modtime</b><var><a name="index-clear_002dvisited_002dfile_002dmodtime-1999"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function clears out the record of the last modification time of
the file being visited by the current buffer.  As a result, the next
attempt to save this buffer will not complain of a discrepancy in
file modification times.

        <p>This function is called in <code>set-visited-file-name</code> and other
exceptional places where the usual test to avoid overwriting a changed
file should not be done. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>visited-file-modtime</b><var><a name="index-visited_002dfile_002dmodtime-2000"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the current buffer's recorded last file
modification time, as a list of the form <code>(</code><var>high</var> <var>low</var><code>)</code>. 
(This is the same format that <code>file-attributes</code> uses to return
time values; see <a href="File-Attributes.html#File-Attributes">File Attributes</a>.)

        <p>If the buffer has no recorded last modification time, this function
returns zero.  This case occurs, for instance, if the buffer is not
visiting a file or if the time has been explicitly cleared by
<code>clear-visited-file-modtime</code>.  Note, however, that
<code>visited-file-modtime</code> returns a list for some non-file buffers
too.  For instance, in a Dired buffer listing a directory, it returns
the last modification time of that directory, as recorded by Dired.

        <p>For a new buffer visiting a not yet existing file, <var>high</var> is
&minus;1 and <var>low</var> is 65535, that is,
2**16&nbsp;-&nbsp;1.<!-- /@w -->

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-visited-file-modtime</b><var> &amp;optional time<a name="index-set_002dvisited_002dfile_002dmodtime-2001"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function updates the buffer's record of the last modification time
of the visited file, to the value specified by <var>time</var> if <var>time</var>
is not <code>nil</code>, and otherwise to the last modification time of the
visited file.

        <p>If <var>time</var> is neither <code>nil</code> nor zero, it should have the form
<code>(</code><var>high</var><code> . </code><var>low</var><code>)</code> or <code>(</code><var>high</var> <var>low</var><code>)</code>, in
either case containing two integers, each of which holds 16 bits of the
time.

        <p>This function is useful if the buffer was not read from the file
normally, or if the file itself has been changed for some known benign
reason. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>ask-user-about-supersession-threat</b><var> filename<a name="index-ask_002duser_002dabout_002dsupersession_002dthreat-2002"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is used to ask a user how to proceed after an attempt to
modify an buffer visiting file <var>filename</var> when the file is newer
than the buffer text.  Emacs detects this because the modification
time of the file on disk is newer than the last save-time of the
buffer.  This means some other program has probably altered the file.

        <p><a name="index-file_002dsupersession-2003"></a>Depending on the user's answer, the function may return normally, in
which case the modification of the buffer proceeds, or it may signal a
<code>file-supersession</code> error with data <code>(</code><var>filename</var><code>)</code>, in which
case the proposed buffer modification is not allowed.

        <p>This function is called automatically by Emacs on the proper
occasions.  It exists so you can customize Emacs by redefining it. 
See the file <samp><span class="file">userlock.el</span></samp> for the standard definition.

        <p>See also the file locking mechanism in <a href="File-Locks.html#File-Locks">File Locks</a>.
