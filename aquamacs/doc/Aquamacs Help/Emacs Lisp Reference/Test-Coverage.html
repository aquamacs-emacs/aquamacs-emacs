<a name="index-testcover_002dstart-1018"></a><a name="index-testcover_002dmark_002dall-1019"></a><a name="index-testcover_002dnext_002dmark-1020"></a>  You can do coverage testing for a file of Lisp code by loading the
<code>testcover</code> library and using the command <kbd>M-x
testcover-start &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>file</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to instrument the
code.  Then test your code by calling it one or more times.  Then use
the command <kbd>M-x testcover-mark-all</kbd> to display colored highlights
on the code to show where coverage is insufficient.  The command
<kbd>M-x testcover-next-mark</kbd> will move point forward to the next
highlighted spot.

   <p>Normally, a red highlight indicates the form was never completely
evaluated; a brown highlight means it always evaluated to the same
value (meaning there has been little testing of what is done with the
result).  However, the red highlight is skipped for forms that can't
possibly complete their evaluation, such as <code>error</code>.  The brown
highlight is skipped for forms that are expected to always evaluate to
the same value, such as <code>(setq x 14)</code>.

   <p>For difficult cases, you can add do-nothing macros to your code to
give advice to the test coverage tool.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>1value</b><var> form<a name="index-g_t1value-1021"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Evaluate <var>form</var> and return its value, but inform coverage testing
that <var>form</var>'s value should always be the same. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>noreturn</b><var> form<a name="index-noreturn-1022"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Evaluate <var>form</var>, informing coverage testing that <var>form</var> should
never return.  If it ever does return, you get a run-time error. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Edebug also has a coverage testing feature (see <a href="Coverage-Testing.html#Coverage-Testing">Coverage Testing</a>).  These features partly duplicate each other, and it would
be cleaner to combine them.
