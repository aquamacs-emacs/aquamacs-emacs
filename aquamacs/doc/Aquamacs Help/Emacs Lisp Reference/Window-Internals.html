<p><a name="index-internals_002c-of-window-3899"></a><a name="index-window-internals-3900"></a>
  Windows have the following accessible fields:

     <dl>
<dt><code>frame</code><dd>The frame that this window is on.

     <br><dt><code>mini_p</code><dd>Non-<code>nil</code> if this window is a minibuffer window.

     <br><dt><code>parent</code><dd>Internally, Emacs arranges windows in a tree; each group of siblings has
a parent window whose area includes all the siblings.  This field points
to a window's parent.

     <p>Parent windows do not display buffers, and play little role in display
except to shape their child windows.  Emacs Lisp programs usually have
no access to the parent windows; they operate on the windows at the
leaves of the tree, which actually display buffers.

     <br><dt><code>hchild</code><dt><code>vchild</code><dd>These fields contain the window's leftmost child and its topmost child
respectively.  <code>hchild</code> is used if the window is subdivided
horizontally by child windows, and <code>vchild</code> if it is subdivided
vertically.

     <br><dt><code>next</code><dt><code>prev</code><dd>The next sibling and previous sibling of this window.  <code>next</code> is
<code>nil</code> if the window is the rightmost or bottommost in its group;
<code>prev</code> is <code>nil</code> if it is the leftmost or topmost in its
group.

     <br><dt><code>left_col</code><dd>The left-hand edge of the window, measured in columns, relative to the
leftmost column in the frame (column 0).

     <br><dt><code>top_line</code><dd>The top edge of the window, measured in lines, relative to the topmost
line in the frame (line 0).

     <br><dt><code>total_cols</code><dt><code>total_lines</code><dd>The width and height of the window, measured in columns and lines
respectively.  The width includes the scroll bar and fringes, and/or
the separator line on the right of the window (if any).

     <br><dt><code>buffer</code><dd>The buffer that the window is displaying.

     <br><dt><code>start</code><dd>A marker pointing to the position in the buffer that is the first
character displayed in the window.

     <br><dt><code>pointm</code><dd><a name="index-window-point-internals-3901"></a>This is the value of point in the current buffer when this window is
selected; when it is not selected, it retains its previous value.

     <br><dt><code>force_start</code><dd>If this flag is non-<code>nil</code>, it says that the window has been
scrolled explicitly by the Lisp program.  This affects what the next
redisplay does if point is off the screen: instead of scrolling the
window to show the text around point, it moves point to a location that
is on the screen.

     <br><dt><code>frozen_window_start_p</code><dd>This field is set temporarily to 1 to indicate to redisplay that
<code>start</code> of this window should not be changed, even if point
gets invisible.

     <br><dt><code>start_at_line_beg</code><dd>Non-<code>nil</code> means current value of <code>start</code> was the beginning of a line
when it was chosen.

     <br><dt><code>use_time</code><dd>This is the last time that the window was selected.  The function
<code>get-lru-window</code> uses this field.

     <br><dt><code>sequence_number</code><dd>A unique number assigned to this window when it was created.

     <br><dt><code>last_modified</code><dd>The <code>modiff</code> field of the window's buffer, as of the last time
a redisplay completed in this window.

     <br><dt><code>last_overlay_modified</code><dd>The <code>overlay_modiff</code> field of the window's buffer, as of the last
time a redisplay completed in this window.

     <br><dt><code>last_point</code><dd>The buffer's value of point, as of the last time a redisplay completed
in this window.

     <br><dt><code>last_had_star</code><dd>A non-<code>nil</code> value means the window's buffer was &ldquo;modified&rdquo; when the
window was last updated.

     <br><dt><code>vertical_scroll_bar</code><dd>This window's vertical scroll bar.

     <br><dt><code>left_margin_width</code><dt><code>right_margin_width</code><dd>The widths of the left and right margins in this window.  A value of
<code>nil</code> means to use the buffer's value of <code>left-margin-width</code>
or <code>right-margin-width</code>.

     <br><dt><code>window_end_pos</code><dd>This is computed as <code>z</code> minus the buffer position of the last glyph
in the current matrix of the window.  The value is only valid if
<code>window_end_valid</code> is not <code>nil</code>.

     <br><dt><code>window_end_bytepos</code><dd>The byte position corresponding to <code>window_end_pos</code>.

     <br><dt><code>window_end_vpos</code><dd>The window-relative vertical position of the line containing
<code>window_end_pos</code>.

     <br><dt><code>window_end_valid</code><dd>This field is set to a non-<code>nil</code> value if <code>window_end_pos</code> is truly
valid.  This is <code>nil</code> if nontrivial redisplay is preempted since in that
case the display that <code>window_end_pos</code> was computed for did not get
onto the screen.

     <br><dt><code>cursor</code><dd>A structure describing where the cursor is in this window.

     <br><dt><code>last_cursor</code><dd>The value of <code>cursor</code> as of the last redisplay that finished.

     <br><dt><code>phys_cursor</code><dd>A structure describing where the cursor of this window physically is.

     <br><dt><code>phys_cursor_type</code><dd>The type of cursor that was last displayed on this window.

     <br><dt><code>phys_cursor_on_p</code><dd>This field is non-zero if the cursor is physically on.

     <br><dt><code>cursor_off_p</code><dd>Non-zero means the cursor in this window is logically on.

     <br><dt><code>last_cursor_off_p</code><dd>This field contains the value of <code>cursor_off_p</code> as of the time of
the last redisplay.

     <br><dt><code>must_be_updated_p</code><dd>This is set to 1 during redisplay when this window must be updated.

     <br><dt><code>hscroll</code><dd>This is the number of columns that the display in the window is scrolled
horizontally to the left.  Normally, this is 0.

     <br><dt><code>vscroll</code><dd>Vertical scroll amount, in pixels.  Normally, this is 0.

     <br><dt><code>dedicated</code><dd>Non-<code>nil</code> if this window is dedicated to its buffer.

     <br><dt><code>display_table</code><dd>The window's display table, or <code>nil</code> if none is specified for it.

     <br><dt><code>update_mode_line</code><dd>Non-<code>nil</code> means this window's mode line needs to be updated.

     <br><dt><code>base_line_number</code><dd>The line number of a certain position in the buffer, or <code>nil</code>. 
This is used for displaying the line number of point in the mode line.

     <br><dt><code>base_line_pos</code><dd>The position in the buffer for which the line number is known, or
<code>nil</code> meaning none is known.

     <br><dt><code>region_showing</code><dd>If the region (or part of it) is highlighted in this window, this field
holds the mark position that made one end of that region.  Otherwise,
this field is <code>nil</code>.

     <br><dt><code>column_number_displayed</code><dd>The column number currently displayed in this window's mode line, or <code>nil</code>
if column numbers are not being displayed.

     <br><dt><code>current_matrix</code><dd>A glyph matrix describing the current display of this window.

     <br><dt><code>desired_matrix</code><dd>A glyph matrix describing the desired display of this window.
