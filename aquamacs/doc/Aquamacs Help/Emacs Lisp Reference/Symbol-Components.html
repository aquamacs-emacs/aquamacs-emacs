<h3 class="section">8.1 Symbol Components</h3>

<p><a name="index-symbol-components-448"></a>
  Each symbol has four components (or &ldquo;cells&rdquo;), each of which
references another object:

     <dl>
<dt>Print name<dd><a name="index-print-name-cell-449"></a>The <dfn>print name cell</dfn> holds a string that names the symbol for
reading and printing.  See <code>symbol-name</code> in <a href="Creating-Symbols.html#Creating-Symbols">Creating Symbols</a>.

     <br><dt>Value<dd><a name="index-value-cell-450"></a>The <dfn>value cell</dfn> holds the current value of the symbol as a
variable.  When a symbol is used as a form, the value of the form is the
contents of the symbol's value cell.  See <code>symbol-value</code> in
<a href="Accessing-Variables.html#Accessing-Variables">Accessing Variables</a>.

     <br><dt>Function<dd><a name="index-function-cell-451"></a>The <dfn>function cell</dfn> holds the function definition of the symbol. 
When a symbol is used as a function, its function definition is used in
its place.  This cell is also used to make a symbol stand for a keymap
or a keyboard macro, for editor command execution.  Because each symbol
has separate value and function cells, variables names and function names do
not conflict.  See <code>symbol-function</code> in <a href="Function-Cells.html#Function-Cells">Function Cells</a>.

     <br><dt>Property list<dd><a name="index-property-list-cell-452"></a>The <dfn>property list cell</dfn> holds the property list of the symbol.  See
<code>symbol-plist</code> in <a href="Property-Lists.html#Property-Lists">Property Lists</a>. 
</dl>

   <p>The print name cell always holds a string, and cannot be changed.  The
other three cells can be set individually to any specified Lisp object.

   <p>The print name cell holds the string that is the name of the symbol. 
Since symbols are represented textually by their names, it is important
not to have two symbols with the same name.  The Lisp reader ensures
this: every time it reads a symbol, it looks for an existing symbol with
the specified name before it creates a new one.  (In GNU Emacs Lisp,
this lookup uses a hashing algorithm and an obarray; see <a href="Creating-Symbols.html#Creating-Symbols">Creating Symbols</a>.)

   <p>The value cell holds the symbol's value as a variable
(see <a href="Variables.html#Variables">Variables</a>).  That is what you get if you evaluate the symbol as
a Lisp expression (see <a href="Evaluation.html#Evaluation">Evaluation</a>).  Any Lisp object is a legitimate
value.  Certain symbols have values that cannot be changed; these
include <code>nil</code> and <code>t</code>, and any symbol whose name starts with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; (those are called <dfn>keywords</dfn>).  See <a href="Constant-Variables.html#Constant-Variables">Constant Variables</a>.

   <p>We often refer to &ldquo;the function <code>foo</code>&rdquo; when we really mean
the function stored in the function cell of the symbol <code>foo</code>.  We
make the distinction explicit only when necessary.  In normal
usage, the function cell usually contains a function
(see <a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions</a>) or a macro (see <a href="Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>), as that is what the
Lisp interpreter expects to see there (see <a href="Evaluation.html#Evaluation">Evaluation</a>).  Keyboard
macros (see <a href="Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>), keymaps (see <a href="Keymaps.html#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>) and
autoload objects (see <a href="Autoloading.html#Autoloading">Autoloading</a>) are also sometimes stored in
the function cells of symbols.

   <p>The property list cell normally should hold a correctly formatted
property list (see <a href="Property-Lists.html#Property-Lists">Property Lists</a>), as a number of functions expect
to see a property list there.

   <p>The function cell or the value cell may be <dfn>void</dfn>, which means
that the cell does not reference any object.  (This is not the same
thing as holding the symbol <code>void</code>, nor the same as holding the
symbol <code>nil</code>.)  Examining a function or value cell that is void
results in an error, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Symbol's value as variable is void</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The four functions <code>symbol-name</code>, <code>symbol-value</code>,
<code>symbol-plist</code>, and <code>symbol-function</code> return the contents of
the four cells of a symbol.  Here as an example we show the contents of
the four cells of the symbol <code>buffer-file-name</code>:

<pre class="example">     (symbol-name 'buffer-file-name)
          &rArr; "buffer-file-name"
     (symbol-value 'buffer-file-name)
          &rArr; "/gnu/elisp/symbols.texi"
     (symbol-function 'buffer-file-name)
          &rArr; #&lt;subr buffer-file-name&gt;
     (symbol-plist 'buffer-file-name)
          &rArr; (variable-documentation 29529)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Because this symbol is the variable which holds the name of the file
being visited in the current buffer, the value cell contents we see are
the name of the source file of this chapter of the Emacs Lisp Manual. 
The property list cell contains the list <code>(variable-documentation
29529)</code> which tells the documentation functions where to find the
documentation string for the variable <code>buffer-file-name</code> in the
<samp><span class="file">DOC-</span><var>version</var></samp> file.  (29529 is the offset from the beginning
of the <samp><span class="file">DOC-</span><var>version</var></samp> file to where that documentation string
begins&mdash;see <a href="Documentation-Basics.html#Documentation-Basics">Documentation Basics</a>.)  The function cell contains
the function for returning the name of the file. 
<code>buffer-file-name</code> names a primitive function, which has no read
syntax and prints in hash notation (see <a href="Primitive-Function-Type.html#Primitive-Function-Type">Primitive Function Type</a>).  A
symbol naming a function written in Lisp would have a lambda expression
(or a byte-code object) in this cell.
