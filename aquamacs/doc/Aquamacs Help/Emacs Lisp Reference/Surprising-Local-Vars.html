<h4 class="subsection">13.6.3 Local Variables in Macro Expansions</h4>

<p>In the previous section, the definition of <code>for</code> was fixed as
follows to make the expansion evaluate the macro arguments the proper
number of times:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defmacro for (var from init to final do &amp;rest body)
       "Execute a simple for loop: (for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))."
       `(let ((,var ,init)
              (max ,final))
          (while (&lt;= ,var max)
            ,@body
            (inc ,var))))
</pre>
   <p>The new definition of <code>for</code> has a new problem: it introduces a
local variable named <code>max</code> which the user does not expect.  This
causes trouble in examples such as the following:

<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((max 0))
       (for x from 0 to 10 do
         (let ((this (frob x)))
           (if (&lt; max this)
               (setq max this)))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The references to <code>max</code> inside the body of the <code>for</code>, which
are supposed to refer to the user's binding of <code>max</code>, really access
the binding made by <code>for</code>.

   <p>The way to correct this is to use an uninterned symbol instead of
<code>max</code> (see <a href="Creating-Symbols.html#Creating-Symbols">Creating Symbols</a>).  The uninterned symbol can be
bound and referred to just like any other symbol, but since it is
created by <code>for</code>, we know that it cannot already appear in the
user's program.  Since it is not interned, there is no way the user can
put it into the program later.  It will never appear anywhere except
where put by <code>for</code>.  Here is a definition of <code>for</code> that works
this way:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defmacro for (var from init to final do &amp;rest body)
       "Execute a simple for loop: (for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))."
       (let ((tempvar (make-symbol "max")))
         `(let ((,var ,init)
                (,tempvar ,final))
            (while (&lt;= ,var ,tempvar)
              ,@body
              (inc ,var)))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This creates an uninterned symbol named <code>max</code> and puts it in the
expansion instead of the usual interned symbol <code>max</code> that appears
in expressions ordinarily.
