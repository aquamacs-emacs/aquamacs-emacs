<h3 class="section">38.7 Selective Display</h3>

<!-- @cindex selective display   Duplicates selective-display -->
<p><dfn>Selective display</dfn> refers to a pair of related features for
hiding certain lines on the screen.

   <p>The first variant, explicit selective display, is designed for use
in a Lisp program: it controls which lines are hidden by altering the
text.  This kind of hiding in some ways resembles the effect of the
<code>invisible</code> property (see <a href="Invisible-Text.html#Invisible-Text">Invisible Text</a>), but the two
features are different and do not work the same way.

   <p>In the second variant, the choice of lines to hide is made
automatically based on indentation.  This variant is designed to be a
user-level feature.

   <p>The way you control explicit selective display is by replacing a
newline (control-j) with a carriage return (control-m).  The text that
was formerly a line following that newline is now hidden.  Strictly
speaking, it is temporarily no longer a line at all, since only
newlines can separate lines; it is now part of the previous line.

   <p>Selective display does not directly affect editing commands.  For
example, <kbd>C-f</kbd> (<code>forward-char</code>) moves point unhesitatingly
into hidden text.  However, the replacement of newline characters with
carriage return characters affects some editing commands.  For
example, <code>next-line</code> skips hidden lines, since it searches only
for newlines.  Modes that use selective display can also define
commands that take account of the newlines, or that control which
parts of the text are hidden.

   <p>When you write a selectively displayed buffer into a file, all the
control-m's are output as newlines.  This means that when you next read
in the file, it looks OK, with nothing hidden.  The selective display
effect is seen only within Emacs.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>selective-display</b><var><a name="index-selective_002ddisplay-3374"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This buffer-local variable enables selective display.  This means that
lines, or portions of lines, may be made hidden.

          <ul>
<li>If the value of <code>selective-display</code> is <code>t</code>, then the character
control-m marks the start of hidden text; the control-m, and the rest
of the line following it, are not displayed.  This is explicit selective
display.

          <li>If the value of <code>selective-display</code> is a positive integer, then
lines that start with more than that many columns of indentation are not
displayed. 
</ul>

        <p>When some portion of a buffer is hidden, the vertical movement
commands operate as if that portion did not exist, allowing a single
<code>next-line</code> command to skip any number of hidden lines. 
However, character movement commands (such as <code>forward-char</code>) do
not skip the hidden portion, and it is possible (if tricky) to insert
or delete text in an hidden portion.

        <p>In the examples below, we show the <em>display appearance</em> of the
buffer <code>foo</code>, which changes with the value of
<code>selective-display</code>.  The <em>contents</em> of the buffer do not
change.

     <pre class="example">          (setq selective-display nil)
               &rArr; nil
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          1 on this column
           2on this column
            3n this column
            3n this column
           2on this column
          1 on this column
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (setq selective-display 2)
               &rArr; 2
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          1 on this column
           2on this column
           2on this column
          1 on this column
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
</pre>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>selective-display-ellipses</b><var><a name="index-selective_002ddisplay_002dellipses-3375"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this buffer-local variable is non-<code>nil</code>, then Emacs displays
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo; at the end of a line that is followed by hidden text. 
This example is a continuation of the previous one.

     <pre class="example">          (setq selective-display-ellipses t)
               &rArr; t

          1 on this column
           2on this column ...
           2on this column
          1 on this column
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
</pre>
        <p>You can use a display table to substitute other text for the ellipsis
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;).  See <a href="Display-Tables.html#Display-Tables">Display Tables</a>.
