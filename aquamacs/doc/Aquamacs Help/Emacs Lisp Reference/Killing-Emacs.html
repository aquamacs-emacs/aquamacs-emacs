<h4 class="subsection">39.2.1 Killing Emacs</h4>

<p><a name="index-killing-Emacs-3716"></a>
  Killing Emacs means ending the execution of the Emacs process.  The
parent process normally resumes control.  The low-level primitive for
killing Emacs is <code>kill-emacs</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>kill-emacs</b><var> &amp;optional exit-data<a name="index-kill_002demacs-3717"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command exits the Emacs process and kills it.

        <p>If <var>exit-data</var> is an integer, then it is used as the exit status
of the Emacs process.  (This is useful primarily in batch operation; see
<a href="Batch-Mode.html#Batch-Mode">Batch Mode</a>.)

        <p>If <var>exit-data</var> is a string, its contents are stuffed into the
terminal input buffer so that the shell (or whatever program next reads
input) can read them. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>All the information in the Emacs process, aside from files that have
been saved, is lost when the Emacs process is killed.  Because killing
Emacs inadvertently can lose a lot of work, Emacs queries for
confirmation before actually terminating if you have buffers that need
saving or subprocesses that are running.  This is done in the function
<code>save-buffers-kill-emacs</code>, the higher level function from which
<code>kill-emacs</code> is usually called.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>kill-emacs-query-functions</b><var><a name="index-kill_002demacs_002dquery_002dfunctions-3718"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>After asking the standard questions, <code>save-buffers-kill-emacs</code>
calls the functions in the list <code>kill-emacs-query-functions</code>, in
order of appearance, with no arguments.  These functions can ask for
additional confirmation from the user.  If any of them returns
<code>nil</code>, <code>save-buffers-kill-emacs</code> does not kill Emacs, and
does not run the remaining functions in this hook.  Calling
<code>kill-emacs</code> directly does not run this hook. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>kill-emacs-hook</b><var><a name="index-kill_002demacs_002dhook-3719"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable is a normal hook; once <code>save-buffers-kill-emacs</code> is
finished with all file saving and confirmation, it calls
<code>kill-emacs</code> which runs the functions in this hook. 
<code>kill-emacs</code> does not run this hook in batch mode.

        <p><code>kill-emacs</code> may be invoked directly (that is not via
<code>save-buffers-kill-emacs</code>) if the terminal is disconnected, or in
similar situations where interaction with the user is not possible. 
Thus, if your hook needs to interact with the user, put it on
<code>kill-emacs-query-functions</code>; if it needs to run regardless of
how Emacs is killed, put it on <code>kill-emacs-hook</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>
