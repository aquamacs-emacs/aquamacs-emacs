<h4 class="subsection">38.1.1 Summary: Sequence of Actions at Startup</h4>

<p><a name="index-initialization-of-Emacs-4523"></a><a name="index-startup-of-Emacs-4524"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bstartup_002eel_007d-4525"></a>
  When Emacs is started up, it performs the following operations
(see <code>normal-top-level</code> in <samp><span class="file">startup.el</span></samp>):

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>It adds subdirectories to <code>load-path</code>, by running the file named
<samp><span class="file">subdirs.el</span></samp> in each directory in the list.  Normally, this file
adds the directory's subdirectories to the list, and those are scanned
in their turn.  The files <samp><span class="file">subdirs.el</span></samp> are normally generated
automatically when Emacs is installed.

     <li>It loads any <samp><span class="file">leim-list.el</span></samp> that it finds in the <code>load-path</code>
directories.  This file is intended for registering input methods. 
The search is only for any personal <samp><span class="file">leim-list.el</span></samp> files that you
may have created; it skips the directories containing the standard Emacs
libraries (these should contain only a single <samp><span class="file">leim-list.el</span></samp> file,
which is compiled into the Emacs executable).

     <p><a name="index-before_002dinit_002dtime-4526"></a><li>It sets the variable <code>before-init-time</code> to the value of
<code>current-time</code> (see <a href="Time-of-Day.html#Time-of-Day">Time of Day</a>).  It also sets
<code>after-init-time</code> to <code>nil</code>, which signals to Lisp programs
that Emacs is being initialized.

     <!-- set-locale-environment -->
     <li>It sets the language environment and the terminal coding system,
if requested by environment variables such as <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>.

     <li>It does some basic parsing of the command-line arguments.

     <p><a name="index-initial_002dwindow_002dsystem_0040r_007b_002c-and-startup_007d-4527"></a><a name="index-window_002dsystem_002dinitialization_002dalist-4528"></a><li>If not running in batch mode, it initializes the window system that
the variable <code>initial-window-system</code> specifies (see <a href="Window-Systems.html#Window-Systems">initial-window-system</a>).  The initialization function for
each supported window system is specified by
<code>window-system-initialization-alist</code>.  If the value
of <code>initial-window-system</code> is <var>windowsystem</var>, then the
appropriate initialization function is defined in the file
<samp><span class="file">term/</span><var>windowsystem</var><span class="file">-win.el</span></samp>.  This file should have been
compiled into the Emacs executable when it was built.

     <li>It runs the normal hook <code>before-init-hook</code>.

     <li>If appropriate, it creates a graphical frame.  This is not done if the
options &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--batch</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--daemon</span></samp>&rsquo; were specified.

     <li>It initializes the initial frame's faces, and sets up the menu bar
and tool bar if needed.  If graphical frames are supported, it sets up
the tool bar even if the current frame is not a graphical one, since a
graphical frame may be created later on.

     <li>It use <code>custom-reevaluate-setting</code> to re-initialize the members
of the list <code>custom-delayed-init-variables</code>.  These are any
pre-loaded user options whose default value depends on the run-time,
rather than build-time, context. 
See <a href="Building-Emacs.html#Building-Emacs">custom-initialize-delay</a>.

     <!-- @item -->
     <!-- It registers the colors available for tty frames. -->
     <li>It loads the library <samp><span class="file">site-start</span></samp>, if it exists.  This is not
done if the options &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Q</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--no-site-file</span></samp>&rsquo; were specified. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bsite_002dstart_002eel_007d-4529"></a>
<li>It loads your init file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).  This is not done if the
options &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Q</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--batch</span></samp>&rsquo; were specified.  If
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-u</span></samp>&rsquo; option was specified, Emacs looks for the init file in
that user's home directory instead.

     <li>It loads the library <samp><span class="file">default</span></samp>, if it exists.  This is not done
if <code>inhibit-default-init</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, nor if the options
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Q</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--batch</span></samp>&rsquo; were specified. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bdefault_002eel_007d-4530"></a>
<li>It loads your abbrevs from the file specified by
<code>abbrev-file-name</code>, if that file exists and can be read
(see <a href="Abbrev-Files.html#Abbrev-Files">abbrev-file-name</a>).  This is not done if the
option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--batch</span></samp>&rsquo; was specified.

     <li>If <code>package-enable-at-startup</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, it calls the
function <code>package-initialize</code> to activate any optional Emacs Lisp
package that has been installed.  See <a href="Packaging-Basics.html#Packaging-Basics">Packaging Basics</a>.

     <p><a name="index-after_002dinit_002dtime-4531"></a><li>It sets the variable <code>after-init-time</code> to the value of
<code>current-time</code>.  This variable was set to <code>nil</code> earlier;
setting it to the current time signals that the initialization phase
is over, and, together with <code>before-init-time</code>, provides the
measurement of how long it took.

     <li>It runs the normal hook <code>after-init-hook</code>.

     <li>If the buffer <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> exists and is still in Fundamental mode
(as it should be by default), it sets its major mode according to
<code>initial-major-mode</code>.

     <li>If started on a text terminal, it loads the terminal-specific
Lisp library (see <a href="Terminal_002dSpecific.html#Terminal_002dSpecific">Terminal-Specific</a>), and runs the hook
<code>tty-setup-hook</code>.  This is not done
in <code>--batch</code> mode, nor if <code>term-file-prefix</code> is <code>nil</code>.

     <!-- Now command-line calls command-line-1. -->
     <li>It displays the initial echo area message, unless you have suppressed
that with <code>inhibit-startup-echo-area-message</code>.

     <li>It processes any command-line options that were not handled earlier.

     <!-- This next one is back in command-line, but the remaining bits of -->
     <!-- command-line-1 are not done if noninteractive. -->
     <li>It now exits if the option <code>--batch</code> was specified.

     <li>If the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer exists and is empty, it inserts
<code>(substitute-command-keys initial-scratch-message)</code> into that buffer.

     <li>If <code>initial-buffer-choice</code> is a string, it visits the file (or
directory) with that name.  If it is a function, it calls the function
with no arguments and selects the buffer that it returns.  If one file
is given as a command line argument, that file is visited and its
buffer displayed alongside <code>initial-buffer-choice</code>.  If more than
one file is given, all of the files are visited and the <samp><span class="file">*Buffer
List*</span></samp> buffer is displayed alongside <code>initial-buffer-choice</code>.

     <!-- To make things nice and confusing, the next three items can be -->
     <!-- called from two places.  If displaying a startup screen, they are -->
     <!-- called in command-line-1 before the startup screen is shown. -->
     <!-- inhibit-startup-hooks is then set and window-setup-hook set to nil. -->
     <!-- If not displaying a startup screen, they are are called in -->
     <!-- normal-top-level. -->
     <!-- FIXME?  So it seems they can be called before or after the -->
     <!-- daemon/session restore step? -->
     <li>It runs <code>emacs-startup-hook</code>.

     <li>It calls <code>frame-notice-user-settings</code>, which modifies the
parameters of the selected frame according to whatever the init files
specify.

     <li>It runs <code>window-setup-hook</code>.  The only difference between this
hook and <code>emacs-startup-hook</code> is that this one runs after the
previously mentioned modifications to the frame parameters.

     <li><a name="index-startup-screen-4532"></a>It displays the <dfn>startup screen</dfn>, which is a special buffer that
contains information about copyleft and basic Emacs usage.  This is
not done if <code>inhibit-startup-screen</code> or <code>initial-buffer-choice</code>
are non-<code>nil</code>, or if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--no-splash</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Q</span></samp>&rsquo; command-line
options were specified.

     <!-- End of command-line-1. -->
     <!-- Back to command-line from command-line-1. -->
     <!-- This is the point at which we actually exit in batch mode, but the -->
     <!-- last few bits of command-line-1 are not done in batch mode. -->
     <li>If the option <code>--daemon</code> was specified, it calls
<code>server-start</code>, and on Posix systems also detaches from the
controlling terminal.  See <a href="../emacs/Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>.

     <li>If started by the X session manager, it calls
<code>emacs-session-restore</code> passing it as argument the ID of the
previous session.  See <a href="Session-Management.html#Session-Management">Session Management</a>.

     <!-- End of command-line. -->
     <!-- Back to normal-top-level from command-line. -->
        </ol>

<p class="noindent">The following options affect some aspects of the startup sequence.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>inhibit-startup-screen</b><var><a name="index-inhibit_002dstartup_002dscreen-4533"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable, if non-<code>nil</code>, inhibits the startup screen.  In
that case, Emacs typically displays the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer; but
see <code>initial-buffer-choice</code>, below.

        <p>Do not set this variable in the init file of a new user, or in a way
that affects more than one user, as that would prevent new users from
receiving information about copyleft and basic Emacs usage.

        <p><a name="index-inhibit_002dstartup_002dmessage-4534"></a><a name="index-inhibit_002dsplash_002dscreen-4535"></a><code>inhibit-startup-message</code> and <code>inhibit-splash-screen</code> are
aliases for this variable. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>initial-buffer-choice</b><var><a name="index-initial_002dbuffer_002dchoice-4536"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If non-<code>nil</code>, this variable is a string that specifies a file or
directory for Emacs to display after starting up, instead of the
startup screen. 
If its value is a function, Emacs calls that function which must
return a buffer which is then displayed. 
If its value is <code>t</code>, Emacs displays the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>inhibit-startup-echo-area-message</b><var><a name="index-inhibit_002dstartup_002decho_002darea_002dmessage-4537"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable controls the display of the startup echo area message. 
You can suppress the startup echo area message by adding text with this
form to your init file:

     <pre class="example">          (setq inhibit-startup-echo-area-message
                "<var>your-login-name</var>")
</pre>
        <p>Emacs explicitly checks for an expression as shown above in your init
file; your login name must appear in the expression as a Lisp string
constant.  You can also use the Customize interface.  Other methods of
setting <code>inhibit-startup-echo-area-message</code> to the same value do
not inhibit the startup message.  This way, you can easily inhibit the
message for yourself if you wish, but thoughtless copying of your init
file will not inhibit the message for someone else. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>initial-scratch-message</b><var><a name="index-initial_002dscratch_002dmessage-4538"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable, if non-<code>nil</code>, should be a string, which is
treated as documentation to be
inserted into the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer when Emacs starts up.  If it
is <code>nil</code>, the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer is empty. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<p class="noindent">The following command-line options affect some aspects of the startup
sequence.  See <a href="../emacs/Initial-Options.html#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>--no-splash</code><dd>Do not display a splash screen.

     <br><dt><code>--batch</code><dd>Run without an interactive terminal.  See <a href="Batch-Mode.html#Batch-Mode">Batch Mode</a>.

     <br><dt><code>--daemon</code><dd>Do not initialize any display; just start a server in the background.

     <br><dt><code>--no-init-file</code><dt><code>-q</code><dd>Do not load either the init file, or the <samp><span class="file">default</span></samp> library.

     <br><dt><code>--no-site-file</code><dd>Do not load the <samp><span class="file">site-start</span></samp> library.

     <br><dt><code>--quick</code><dt><code>-Q</code><dd>Equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-q --no-site-file --no-splash</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<!-- and -no-site-lisp, but let's not mention that here. -->
