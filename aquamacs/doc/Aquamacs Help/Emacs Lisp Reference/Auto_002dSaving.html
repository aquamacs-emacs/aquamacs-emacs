<h3 class="section">26.2 Auto-Saving</h3>

<!-- @cindex auto-saving   Lots of symbols starting with auto-save here. -->
<p>Emacs periodically saves all files that you are visiting; this is
called <dfn>auto-saving</dfn>.  Auto-saving prevents you from losing more
than a limited amount of work if the system crashes.  By default,
auto-saves happen every 300 keystrokes, or after around 30 seconds of
idle time.  See <a href="../emacs/Auto-Save.html#Auto-Save">Auto Save</a>, for information on auto-save
for users.  Here we describe the functions used to implement auto-saving
and the variables that control them.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>buffer-auto-save-file-name</b><var><a name="index-buffer_002dauto_002dsave_002dfile_002dname-1936"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This buffer-local variable is the name of the file used for
auto-saving the current buffer.  It is <code>nil</code> if the buffer
should not be auto-saved.

     <pre class="example">          buffer-auto-save-file-name
               &rArr; "/xcssun/users/rms/lewis/#backups.texi#"
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>auto-save-mode</b><var> arg<a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dmode-1937"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>When used interactively without an argument, this command is a toggle
switch: it turns on auto-saving of the current buffer if it is off, and
vice versa.  With an argument <var>arg</var>, the command turns auto-saving
on if the value of <var>arg</var> is <code>t</code>, a nonempty list, or a positive
integer.  Otherwise, it turns auto-saving off. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>auto-save-file-name-p</b><var> filename<a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dfile_002dname_002dp-1938"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a non-<code>nil</code> value if <var>filename</var> is a
string that could be the name of an auto-save file.  It assumes
the usual naming convention for auto-save files: a name that
begins and ends with hash marks (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;) is a possible auto-save file
name.  The argument <var>filename</var> should not contain a directory part.

     <pre class="example">          (make-auto-save-file-name)
               &rArr; "/xcssun/users/rms/lewis/#backups.texi#"
          (auto-save-file-name-p "#backups.texi#")
               &rArr; 0
          (auto-save-file-name-p "backups.texi")
               &rArr; nil
</pre>
        <p>The standard definition of this function is as follows:

     <pre class="example">          (defun auto-save-file-name-p (filename)
            "Return non-nil if FILENAME can be yielded by..."
            (string-match "^#.*#$" filename))
</pre>
        <p>This function exists so that you can customize it if you wish to
change the naming convention for auto-save files.  If you redefine it,
be sure to redefine the function <code>make-auto-save-file-name</code>
correspondingly. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>make-auto-save-file-name</b><var><a name="index-make_002dauto_002dsave_002dfile_002dname-1939"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the file name to use for auto-saving the current
buffer.  This is just the file name with hash marks (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;) prepended
and appended to it.  This function does not look at the variable
<code>auto-save-visited-file-name</code> (described below); callers of this
function should check that variable first.

     <pre class="example">          (make-auto-save-file-name)
               &rArr; "/xcssun/users/rms/lewis/#backups.texi#"
</pre>
        <p>Here is a simplified version of the standard definition of this
function:

     <pre class="example">          (defun make-auto-save-file-name ()
            "Return file name to use for auto-saves \
          of current buffer.."
            (if buffer-file-name
                (concat
                 (file-name-directory buffer-file-name)
                 "#"
                 (file-name-nondirectory buffer-file-name)
                 "#")
              (expand-file-name
               (concat "#%" (buffer-name) "#"))))
</pre>
        <p>This exists as a separate function so that you can redefine it to
customize the naming convention for auto-save files.  Be sure to
change <code>auto-save-file-name-p</code> in a corresponding way. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>auto-save-visited-file-name</b><var><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dvisited_002dfile_002dname-1940"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs auto-saves buffers in
the files they are visiting.  That is, the auto-save is done in the same
file that you are editing.  Normally, this variable is <code>nil</code>, so
auto-save files have distinct names that are created by
<code>make-auto-save-file-name</code>.

        <p>When you change the value of this variable, the new value does not take
effect in an existing buffer until the next time auto-save mode is
reenabled in it.  If auto-save mode is already enabled, auto-saves
continue to go in the same file name until <code>auto-save-mode</code> is
called again. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>recent-auto-save-p</b><var><a name="index-recent_002dauto_002dsave_002dp-1941"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if the current buffer has been
auto-saved since the last time it was read in or saved. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-buffer-auto-saved</b><var><a name="index-set_002dbuffer_002dauto_002dsaved-1942"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function marks the current buffer as auto-saved.  The buffer will
not be auto-saved again until the buffer text is changed again.  The
function returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>auto-save-interval</b><var><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dinterval-1943"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable specifies how often to do auto-saving, in
terms of number of input events.  Each time this many additional input
events are read, Emacs does auto-saving for all buffers in which that is
enabled.  Setting this to zero disables autosaving based on the
number of characters typed. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>auto-save-timeout</b><var><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dtimeout-1944"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is the number of seconds of idle time that
should cause auto-saving.  Each time the user pauses for this long,
Emacs does auto-saving for all buffers in which that is enabled.  (If
the current buffer is large, the specified timeout is multiplied by a
factor that increases as the size increases; for a million-byte
buffer, the factor is almost 4.)

        <p>If the value is zero or <code>nil</code>, then auto-saving is not done as a
result of idleness, only after a certain number of input events as
specified by <code>auto-save-interval</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>auto-save-hook</b><var><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dhook-1945"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This normal hook is run whenever an auto-save is about to happen. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>auto-save-default</b><var><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002ddefault-1946"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, buffers that are visiting files
have auto-saving enabled by default.  Otherwise, they do not. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>do-auto-save</b><var> &amp;optional no-message current-only<a name="index-do_002dauto_002dsave-1947"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function auto-saves all buffers that need to be auto-saved.  It
saves all buffers for which auto-saving is enabled and that have been
changed since the previous auto-save.

        <p>If any buffers are auto-saved, <code>do-auto-save</code> normally displays a
message saying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Auto-saving...</span></samp>&rsquo; in the echo area while
auto-saving is going on.  However, if <var>no-message</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, the message is inhibited.

        <p>If <var>current-only</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, only the current buffer
is auto-saved. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>delete-auto-save-file-if-necessary</b><var> &amp;optional force<a name="index-delete_002dauto_002dsave_002dfile_002dif_002dnecessary-1948"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function deletes the current buffer's auto-save file if
<code>delete-auto-save-files</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  It is called every
time a buffer is saved.

        <p>Unless <var>force</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this function only deletes the
file if it was written by the current Emacs session since the last
true save. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>delete-auto-save-files</b><var><a name="index-delete_002dauto_002dsave_002dfiles-1949"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable is used by the function
<code>delete-auto-save-file-if-necessary</code>.  If it is non-<code>nil</code>,
Emacs deletes auto-save files when a true save is done (in the visited
file).  This saves disk space and unclutters your directory. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>rename-auto-save-file</b><var><a name="index-rename_002dauto_002dsave_002dfile-1950"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function adjusts the current buffer's auto-save file name if the
visited file name has changed.  It also renames an existing auto-save
file, if it was made in the current Emacs session.  If the visited
file name has not changed, this function does nothing. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>buffer-saved-size</b><var><a name="index-buffer_002dsaved_002dsize-1951"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this buffer-local variable is the length of the current
buffer, when it was last read in, saved, or auto-saved.  This is
used to detect a substantial decrease in size, and turn off auto-saving
in response.

        <p>If it is &minus;1, that means auto-saving is temporarily shut off in
this buffer due to a substantial decrease in size.  Explicitly saving
the buffer stores a positive value in this variable, thus reenabling
auto-saving.  Turning auto-save mode off or on also updates this
variable, so that the substantial decrease in size is forgotten.

        <p>If it is &minus;2, that means this buffer should disregard changes in
buffer size; in particular, it should not shut off auto-saving
temporarily due to changes in buffer size. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>auto-save-list-file-name</b><var><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dlist_002dfile_002dname-1952"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable (if non-<code>nil</code>) specifies a file for recording the
names of all the auto-save files.  Each time Emacs does auto-saving, it
writes two lines into this file for each buffer that has auto-saving
enabled.  The first line gives the name of the visited file (it's empty
if the buffer has none), and the second gives the name of the auto-save
file.

        <p>When Emacs exits normally, it deletes this file; if Emacs crashes, you
can look in the file to find all the auto-save files that might contain
work that was otherwise lost.  The <code>recover-session</code> command uses
this file to find them.

        <p>The default name for this file specifies your home directory and starts
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.saves-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It also contains the Emacs process <acronym>ID</acronym> and the
host name. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>auto-save-list-file-prefix</b><var><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dlist_002dfile_002dprefix-1953"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>After Emacs reads your init file, it initializes
<code>auto-save-list-file-name</code> (if you have not already set it
non-<code>nil</code>) based on this prefix, adding the host name and process
ID.  If you set this to <code>nil</code> in your init file, then Emacs does
not initialize <code>auto-save-list-file-name</code>.
