<h3 class="section">30.1 Point</h3>

<p><a name="index-point-2390"></a>
  <dfn>Point</dfn> is a special buffer position used by many editing
commands, including the self-inserting typed characters and text
insertion functions.  Other commands move point through the text
to allow editing and insertion at different places.

   <p>Like other positions, point designates a place between two characters
(or before the first character, or after the last character), rather
than a particular character.  Usually terminals display the cursor over
the character that immediately follows point; point is actually before
the character on which the cursor sits.

   <p><a name="index-point-with-narrowing-2391"></a>  The value of point is a number no less than 1, and no greater than the
buffer size plus 1.  If narrowing is in effect (see <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>), then
point is constrained to fall within the accessible portion of the buffer
(possibly at one end of it).

   <p>Each buffer has its own value of point, which is independent of the
value of point in other buffers.  Each window also has a value of point,
which is independent of the value of point in other windows on the same
buffer.  This is why point can have different values in various windows
that display the same buffer.  When a buffer appears in only one window,
the buffer's point and the window's point normally have the same value,
so the distinction is rarely important.  See <a href="Window-Point.html#Window-Point">Window Point</a>, for more
details.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>point</b><var><a name="index-point-2392"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-current-buffer-position-2393"></a>This function returns the value of point in the current buffer,
as an integer.

     <pre class="example">          (point)
               &rArr; 175
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>point-min</b><var><a name="index-point_002dmin-2394"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the minimum accessible value of point in the
current buffer.  This is normally 1, but if narrowing is in effect, it
is the position of the start of the region that you narrowed to. 
(See <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.) 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>point-max</b><var><a name="index-point_002dmax-2395"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the maximum accessible value of point in the
current buffer.  This is <code>(1+ (buffer-size))</code>, unless narrowing is
in effect, in which case it is the position of the end of the region
that you narrowed to.  (See <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.) 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>buffer-end</b><var> flag<a name="index-buffer_002dend-2396"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>(point-max)</code> if <var>flag</var> is greater than
0, <code>(point-min)</code> otherwise.  The argument <var>flag</var> must be a
number. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>buffer-size</b><var> &amp;optional buffer<a name="index-buffer_002dsize-2397"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the total number of characters in the current
buffer.  In the absence of any narrowing (see <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>),
<code>point-max</code> returns a value one larger than this.

        <p>If you specify a buffer, <var>buffer</var>, then the value is the
size of <var>buffer</var>.

     <pre class="example">          (buffer-size)
               &rArr; 35
          (point-max)
               &rArr; 36
</pre>
