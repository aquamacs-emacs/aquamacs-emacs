<h4 class="subsection">39.1.4 Command-Line Arguments</h4>

<p><a name="index-command_002dline-arguments-3704"></a>
  You can use command-line arguments to request various actions when you
start Emacs.  Since you do not need to start Emacs more than once per
day, and will often leave your Emacs session running longer than that,
command-line arguments are hardly ever used.  As a practical matter, it
is best to avoid making the habit of using them, since this habit would
encourage you to kill and restart Emacs unnecessarily often.  These
options exist for two reasons: to be compatible with other editors (for
invocation by other programs) and to enable shell scripts to run
specific Lisp programs.

   <p>This section describes how Emacs processes command-line arguments,
and how you can customize them.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>command-line</b><var><a name="index-command_002dline-3705"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function parses the command line that Emacs was called with,
processes it, loads the user's init file and displays the
startup messages. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>command-line-processed</b><var><a name="index-command_002dline_002dprocessed-3706"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is <code>t</code> once the command line has been
processed.

        <p>If you redump Emacs by calling <code>dump-emacs</code>, you may wish to set
this variable to <code>nil</code> first in order to cause the new dumped Emacs
to process its new command-line arguments. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>command-switch-alist</b><var><a name="index-command_002dswitch_002dalist-3707"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-switches-on-command-line-3708"></a><a name="index-options-on-command-line-3709"></a><a name="index-command_002dline-options-3710"></a>The value of this variable is an alist of user-defined command-line
options and associated handler functions.  This variable exists so you
can add elements to it.

        <p>A <dfn>command-line option</dfn> is an argument on the command line, which
has the form:

     <pre class="example">          -<var>option</var>
</pre>
        <p>The elements of the <code>command-switch-alist</code> look like this:

     <pre class="example">          (<var>option</var> . <var>handler-function</var>)
</pre>
        <p>The <span class="sc">car</span>, <var>option</var>, is a string, the name of a command-line
option (not including the initial hyphen).  The <var>handler-function</var>
is called to handle <var>option</var>, and receives the option name as its
sole argument.

        <p>In some cases, the option is followed in the command line by an
argument.  In these cases, the <var>handler-function</var> can find all the
remaining command-line arguments in the variable
<code>command-line-args-left</code>.  (The entire list of command-line
arguments is in <code>command-line-args</code>.)

        <p>The command-line arguments are parsed by the <code>command-line-1</code>
function in the <samp><span class="file">startup.el</span></samp> file.  See also <a href="../emacs/Emacs-Invocation.html#Emacs-Invocation">Command Line Arguments for Emacs Invocation</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>command-line-args</b><var><a name="index-command_002dline_002dargs-3711"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is the list of command-line arguments passed
to Emacs. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>command-line-args-left</b><var><a name="index-command_002dline_002dargs_002dleft-3712"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-argv-3713"></a>The value of this variable is the list of command-line arguments that
have not yet been processed.  <code>argv</code> is an alias for this. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>command-line-functions</b><var><a name="index-command_002dline_002dfunctions-3714"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable's value is a list of functions for handling an
unrecognized command-line argument.  Each time the next argument to be
processed has no special meaning, the functions in this list are called,
in order of appearance, until one of them returns a non-<code>nil</code>
value.

        <p>These functions are called with no arguments.  They can access the
command-line argument under consideration through the variable
<code>argi</code>, which is bound temporarily at this point.  The remaining
arguments (not including the current one) are in the variable
<code>command-line-args-left</code>.

        <p>When a function recognizes and processes the argument in <code>argi</code>, it
should return a non-<code>nil</code> value to say it has dealt with that
argument.  If it has also dealt with some of the following arguments, it
can indicate that by deleting them from <code>command-line-args-left</code>.

        <p>If all of these functions return <code>nil</code>, then the argument is used
as a file name to visit.
