<h3 class="section">37.15 Network Servers</h3>

<p><a name="index-network-servers-3278"></a>
  You create a server by calling <code>make-network-process</code> with
<code>:server t</code>.  The server will listen for connection requests from
clients.  When it accepts a client connection request, that creates a
new network connection, itself a process object, with the following
parameters:

     <ul>
<li>The connection's process name is constructed by concatenating the
server process' <var>name</var> with a client identification string.  The
client identification string for an IPv4 connection looks like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span><var>a</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>b</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>c</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>d</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>p</var><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Otherwise, it is a
unique number in brackets, as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span><var>nnn</var><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The number
is unique for each connection in the Emacs session.

     <li>If the server's filter is non-<code>nil</code>, the connection process does
not get a separate process buffer; otherwise, Emacs creates a new
buffer for the purpose.  The buffer name is the server's buffer name
or process name, concatenated with the client identification string.

     <p>The server's process buffer value is never used directly by Emacs, but
it is passed to the log function, which can log connections by
inserting text there.

     <li>The communication type and the process filter and sentinel are
inherited from those of the server.  The server never directly
uses its filter and sentinel; their sole purpose is to initialize
connections made to the server.

     <li>The connection's process contact info is set according to the client's
addressing information (typically an IP address and a port number). 
This information is associated with the <code>process-contact</code>
keywords <code>:host</code>, <code>:service</code>, <code>:remote</code>.

     <li>The connection's local address is set up according to the port
number used for the connection.

     <li>The client process' plist is initialized from the server's plist. 
</ul>
