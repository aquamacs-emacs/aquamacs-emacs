<h4 class="subsection">35.2.2 Syntax Flags</h4>

<p><a name="index-syntax-flags-3073"></a>
  In addition to the classes, entries for characters in a syntax table
can specify flags.  There are seven possible flags, represented by the
characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>All the flags except &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; are used to describe
multi-character comment delimiters.  The digit flags indicate that a
character can <em>also</em> be part of a comment sequence, in addition to
the syntactic properties associated with its character class.  The flags
are independent of the class and each other for the sake of characters
such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in C mode, which is a punctuation character, <em>and</em>
the second character of a start-of-comment sequence (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>&rsquo;),
<em>and</em> the first character of an end-of-comment sequence
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p>Here is a table of the possible flags for a character <var>c</var>,
and what they mean:

     <ul>
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; means <var>c</var> is the start of a two-character comment-start
sequence.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo; means <var>c</var> is the second character of such a sequence.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>&rsquo; means <var>c</var> is the start of a two-character comment-end
sequence.

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4</span></samp>&rsquo; means <var>c</var> is the second character of such a sequence.

     <li><!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; means that <var>c</var> as a comment delimiter belongs to the
alternative &ldquo;b&rdquo; comment style.

     <p>Emacs supports two comment styles simultaneously in any one syntax
table.  This is for the sake of C++.  Each style of comment syntax has
its own comment-start sequence and its own comment-end sequence.  Each
comment must stick to one style or the other; thus, if it starts with
the comment-start sequence of style &ldquo;b,&rdquo; it must also end with the
comment-end sequence of style &ldquo;b.&rdquo;

     <p>The two comment-start sequences must begin with the same character; only
the second character may differ.  Mark the second character of the
&ldquo;b&rdquo;-style comment-start sequence with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; flag.

     <p>A comment-end sequence (one or two characters) applies to the &ldquo;b&rdquo;
style if its first character has the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; flag set; otherwise, it
applies to the &ldquo;a&rdquo; style.

     <p>The appropriate comment syntax settings for C++ are as follows:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">124b</span></samp>&rsquo;
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">23</span></samp>&rsquo;
<br><dt>newline<dd>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;b</span></samp>&rsquo;
</dl>

     <p>This defines four comment-delimiting sequences:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is a comment-start sequence for &ldquo;a&rdquo; style because the
second character, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, does not have the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; flag.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is a comment-start sequence for &ldquo;b&rdquo; style because the second
character, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;, does have the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; flag.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is a comment-end sequence for &ldquo;a&rdquo; style because the first
character, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, does not have the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; flag.

          <br><dt>newline<dd>This is a comment-end sequence for &ldquo;b&rdquo; style, because the newline
character has the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; flag. 
</dl>

     <li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; on a comment delimiter character specifies
that this kind of comment can be nested.  For a two-character
comment delimiter, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; on either character makes it
nestable.

     <li><!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; identifies an additional &ldquo;prefix character&rdquo; for Lisp syntax. 
These characters are treated as whitespace when they appear between
expressions.  When they appear within an expression, they are handled
according to their usual syntax classes.

     <p>The function <code>backward-prefix-chars</code> moves back over these
characters, as well as over characters whose primary syntax class is
prefix (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo;).  See <a href="Motion-and-Syntax.html#Motion-and-Syntax">Motion and Syntax</a>. 
</ul>
