<h3 class="section">16.3 Documentation Strings and Compilation</h3>

<p><a name="index-dynamic-loading-of-documentation-854"></a>
  Functions and variables loaded from a byte-compiled file access their
documentation strings dynamically from the file whenever needed.  This
saves space within Emacs, and makes loading faster because the
documentation strings themselves need not be processed while loading the
file.  Actual access to the documentation strings becomes slower as a
result, but this normally is not enough to bother users.

   <p>Dynamic access to documentation strings does have drawbacks:

     <ul>
<li>If you delete or move the compiled file after loading it, Emacs can no
longer access the documentation strings for the functions and variables
in the file.

     <li>If you alter the compiled file (such as by compiling a new version),
then further access to documentation strings in this file will
probably give nonsense results. 
</ul>

   <p>If your site installs Emacs following the usual procedures, these
problems will never normally occur.  Installing a new version uses a new
directory with a different name; as long as the old version remains
installed, its files will remain unmodified in the places where they are
expected to be.

   <p>However, if you have built Emacs yourself and use it from the
directory where you built it, you will experience this problem
occasionally if you edit and recompile Lisp files.  When it happens, you
can cure the problem by reloading the file after recompiling it.

   <p>You can turn off this feature at compile time by setting
<code>byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</code> to <code>nil</code>; this is useful
mainly if you expect to change the file, and you want Emacs processes
that have already loaded it to keep working when the file changes. 
You can do this globally, or for one source file by specifying a
file-local binding for the variable.  One way to do that is by adding
this string to the file's first line:

<pre class="example">     -*-byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings: nil;-*-
</pre>
   <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</b><var><a name="index-byte_002dcompile_002ddynamic_002ddocstrings-855"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this is non-<code>nil</code>, the byte compiler generates compiled files
that are set up for dynamic loading of documentation strings. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0023_0040_0040_0040var_007bcount_007d_007d-856"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0023_0024_007d-857"></a>  The dynamic documentation string feature writes compiled files that
use a special Lisp reader construct, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#@</span><var>count</var></samp>&rsquo;.  This
construct skips the next <var>count</var> characters.  It also uses the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#$</span></samp>&rsquo; construct, which stands for &ldquo;the name of this file, as a
string.&rdquo;  It is usually best not to use these constructs in Lisp source
files, since they are not designed to be clear to humans reading the
file.
