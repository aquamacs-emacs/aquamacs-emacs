<h3 class="section">35.1 Syntax Table Concepts</h3>

<p>A <dfn>syntax table</dfn> provides Emacs with the information that
determines the syntactic use of each character in a buffer.  This
information is used by the parsing commands, the complex movement
commands, and others to determine where words, symbols, and other
syntactic constructs begin and end.  The current syntax table controls
the meaning of the word motion functions (see <a href="Word-Motion.html#Word-Motion">Word Motion</a>) and the
list motion functions (see <a href="List-Motion.html#List-Motion">List Motion</a>) as well as the functions in
this chapter.

<p>A syntax table is a char-table (see <a href="Char_002dTables.html#Char_002dTables">Char-Tables</a>).  The element at
index <var>c</var> describes the character with code <var>c</var>.  The element's
value should be a list that encodes the syntax of the character in
question.

   <p>Syntax tables are used only for moving across text, not for the Emacs
Lisp reader.  Emacs Lisp uses built-in syntactic rules when reading Lisp
expressions, and these rules cannot be changed.  (Some Lisp systems
provide ways to redefine the read syntax, but we decided to leave this
feature out of Emacs Lisp for simplicity.)

   <p>Each buffer has its own major mode, and each major mode has its own
idea of the syntactic class of various characters.  For example, in Lisp
mode, the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; begins a comment, but in C mode, it
terminates a statement.  To support these variations, Emacs makes the
choice of syntax table local to each buffer.  Typically, each major
mode has its own syntax table and installs that table in each buffer
that uses that mode.  Changing this table alters the syntax in all
those buffers as well as in any buffers subsequently put in that mode. 
Occasionally several similar modes share one syntax table. 
See <a href="Example-Major-Modes.html#Example-Major-Modes">Example Major Modes</a>, for an example of how to set up a syntax
table.

   <p>A syntax table can inherit the data for some characters from the
standard syntax table, while specifying other characters itself.  The
&ldquo;inherit&rdquo; syntax class means &ldquo;inherit this character's syntax from
the standard syntax table.&rdquo;  Just changing the standard syntax for a
character affects all syntax tables that inherit from it.
