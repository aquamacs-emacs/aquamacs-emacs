<h3 class="section">8.3 Creating and Interning Symbols</h3>

<p><a name="index-reading-symbols-454"></a>
  To understand how symbols are created in GNU Emacs Lisp, you must know
how Lisp reads them.  Lisp must ensure that it finds the same symbol
every time it reads the same set of characters.  Failure to do so would
cause complete confusion.

   <p><a name="index-symbol-name-hashing-455"></a><a name="index-hashing-456"></a><a name="index-obarray-457"></a><a name="index-bucket-_0028in-obarray_0029-458"></a>  When the Lisp reader encounters a symbol, it reads all the characters
of the name.  Then it &ldquo;hashes&rdquo; those characters to find an index in a
table called an <dfn>obarray</dfn>.  Hashing is an efficient method of
looking something up.  For example, instead of searching a telephone
book cover to cover when looking up Jan Jones, you start with the J's
and go from there.  That is a simple version of hashing.  Each element
of the obarray is a <dfn>bucket</dfn> which holds all the symbols with a
given hash code; to look for a given name, it is sufficient to look
through all the symbols in the bucket for that name's hash code.  (The
same idea is used for general Emacs hash tables, but they are a
different data type; see <a href="Hash-Tables.html#Hash-Tables">Hash Tables</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-interning-459"></a>  If a symbol with the desired name is found, the reader uses that
symbol.  If the obarray does not contain a symbol with that name, the
reader makes a new symbol and adds it to the obarray.  Finding or adding
a symbol with a certain name is called <dfn>interning</dfn> it, and the
symbol is then called an <dfn>interned symbol</dfn>.

   <p>Interning ensures that each obarray has just one symbol with any
particular name.  Other like-named symbols may exist, but not in the
same obarray.  Thus, the reader gets the same symbols for the same
names, as long as you keep reading with the same obarray.

   <p>Interning usually happens automatically in the reader, but sometimes
other programs need to do it.  For example, after the <kbd>M-x</kbd> command
obtains the command name as a string using the minibuffer, it then
interns the string, to get the interned symbol with that name.

   <p><a name="index-symbol-equality-460"></a><a name="index-uninterned-symbol-461"></a>  No obarray contains all symbols; in fact, some symbols are not in any
obarray.  They are called <dfn>uninterned symbols</dfn>.  An uninterned
symbol has the same four cells as other symbols; however, the only way
to gain access to it is by finding it in some other object or as the
value of a variable.

   <p>Creating an uninterned symbol is useful in generating Lisp code,
because an uninterned symbol used as a variable in the code you generate
cannot clash with any variables used in other Lisp programs.

   <p>In Emacs Lisp, an obarray is actually a vector.  Each element of the
vector is a bucket; its value is either an interned symbol whose name
hashes to that bucket, or 0 if the bucket is empty.  Each interned
symbol has an internal link (invisible to the user) to the next symbol
in the bucket.  Because these links are invisible, there is no way to
find all the symbols in an obarray except using <code>mapatoms</code> (below). 
The order of symbols in a bucket is not significant.

   <p>In an empty obarray, every element is 0, so you can create an obarray
with <code>(make-vector </code><var>length</var><code> 0)</code>.  <strong>This is the only
valid way to create an obarray.</strong>  Prime numbers as lengths tend
to result in good hashing; lengths one less than a power of two are also
good.

   <p><strong>Do not try to put symbols in an obarray yourself.</strong>  This does
not work&mdash;only <code>intern</code> can enter a symbol in an obarray properly.

   <p><a name="index-CL-note_002d_002d_002dsymbol-in-obarrays-462"></a><blockquote>
<b>Common Lisp note:</b> In Common Lisp, a single symbol may be interned in
several obarrays. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Most of the functions below take a name and sometimes an obarray as
arguments.  A <code>wrong-type-argument</code> error is signaled if the name
is not a string, or if the obarray is not a vector.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>symbol-name</b><var> symbol<a name="index-symbol_002dname-463"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the string that is <var>symbol</var>'s name.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          (symbol-name 'foo)
               &rArr; "foo"
</pre>
        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Changing the string by substituting characters does
change the name of the symbol, but fails to update the obarray, so don't
do it! 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>make-symbol</b><var> name<a name="index-make_002dsymbol-464"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a newly-allocated, uninterned symbol whose name is
<var>name</var> (which must be a string).  Its value and function definition
are void, and its property list is <code>nil</code>.  In the example below,
the value of <code>sym</code> is not <code>eq</code> to <code>foo</code> because it is a
distinct uninterned symbol whose name is also &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <pre class="example">          (setq sym (make-symbol "foo"))
               &rArr; foo
          (eq sym 'foo)
               &rArr; nil
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>intern</b><var> name &amp;optional obarray<a name="index-intern-465"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the interned symbol whose name is <var>name</var>.  If
there is no such symbol in the obarray <var>obarray</var>, <code>intern</code>
creates a new one, adds it to the obarray, and returns it.  If
<var>obarray</var> is omitted, the value of the global variable
<code>obarray</code> is used.

     <pre class="example">          (setq sym (intern "foo"))
               &rArr; foo
          (eq sym 'foo)

          (setq sym1 (intern "foo" other-obarray))
               &rArr; foo
          (eq sym1 'foo)

<b>Common Lisp note:</b> In Common Lisp, you can intern an existing symbol
in an obarray.  In Emacs Lisp, you cannot do this, because the argument
to <code>intern</code> must be a string, not a symbol.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>intern-soft</b><var> name &amp;optional obarray<a name="index-intern_002dsoft-467"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the symbol in <var>obarray</var> whose name is
<var>name</var>, or <code>nil</code> if <var>obarray</var> has no symbol with that name. 
Therefore, you can use <code>intern-soft</code> to test whether a symbol with
a given name is already interned.  If <var>obarray</var> is omitted, the
value of the global variable <code>obarray</code> is used.

        <p>The argument <var>name</var> may also be a symbol; in that case,
the function returns <var>name</var> if <var>name</var> is interned
in the specified obarray, and otherwise <code>nil</code>.

        <p>If you provide a string instead of a symbol as <var>symbol</var>, it stands
for a symbol name.  Then <code>unintern</code> deletes the symbol (if any) in
the obarray which has that name.  If there is no such symbol,
