<h3 class="section">20.7 Yes-or-No Queries</h3>

<p><a name="index-asking-the-user-questions-1162"></a><a name="index-querying-the-user-1163"></a><a name="index-yes_002dor_002dno-questions-1164"></a>
  This section describes functions used to ask the user a yes-or-no
question.  The function <code>y-or-n-p</code> can be answered with a single
character; it is useful for questions where an inadvertent wrong answer
will not have serious consequences.  <code>yes-or-no-p</code> is suitable for
more momentous questions, since it requires three or four characters to
answer.

   <p>If either of these functions is called in a command that was invoked
using the mouse&mdash;more precisely, if <code>last-nonmenu-event</code>
(see <a href="Command-Loop-Info.html#Command-Loop-Info">Command Loop Info</a>) is either <code>nil</code> or a list&mdash;then it
uses a dialog box or pop-up menu to ask the question.  Otherwise, it
uses keyboard input.  You can force use of the mouse or use of keyboard
input by binding <code>last-nonmenu-event</code> to a suitable value around
the call.

   <p>Strictly speaking, <code>yes-or-no-p</code> uses the minibuffer and
<code>y-or-n-p</code> does not; but it seems best to describe them together.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>y-or-n-p</b><var> prompt<a name="index-y_002dor_002dn_002dp-1165"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function asks the user a question, expecting input in the echo
area.  It returns <code>t</code> if the user types <kbd>y</kbd>, <code>nil</code> if the
user types <kbd>n</kbd>.  This function also accepts &lt;SPC&gt; to mean yes
and &lt;DEL&gt; to mean no.  It accepts <kbd>C-]</kbd> to mean &ldquo;quit,&rdquo; like
<kbd>C-g</kbd>, because the question might look like a minibuffer and for
that reason the user might try to use <kbd>C-]</kbd> to get out.  The answer
is a single character, with no &lt;RET&gt; needed to terminate it.  Upper
and lower case are equivalent.

        <p>&ldquo;Asking the question&rdquo; means printing <var>prompt</var> in the echo area,
followed by the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(y&nbsp;or&nbsp;n)&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  If the input is not one of
the expected answers (<kbd>y</kbd>, <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>,
<kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>, or something that quits), the function responds
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Please answer y or n.</span></samp>&rsquo;, and repeats the request.

        <p>This function does not actually use the minibuffer, since it does not
allow editing of the answer.  It actually uses the echo area (see <a href="The-Echo-Area.html#The-Echo-Area">The Echo Area</a>), which uses the same screen space as the minibuffer.  The
cursor moves to the echo area while the question is being asked.

        <p>The answers and their meanings, even &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, are not
hardwired.  The keymap <code>query-replace-map</code> specifies them. 
See <a href="Search-and-Replace.html#Search-and-Replace">Search and Replace</a>.

        <p>In the following example, the user first types <kbd>q</kbd>, which is
invalid.  At the next prompt the user types <kbd>y</kbd>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (y-or-n-p "Do you need a lift? ")
          
          ;; <span class="roman">After evaluation of the preceding expression,</span>
          ;;   <span class="roman">the following prompt appears in the echo area:</span>
          
          ---------- Echo area ----------
          Do you need a lift? (y or n)
          ---------- Echo area ----------
          
          ;; <span class="roman">If the user then types </span><kbd>q</kbd><span class="roman">, the following appears:</span>
          
          ---------- Echo area ----------
          Please answer y or n.  Do you need a lift? (y or n)
          ---------- Echo area ----------
          
          ;; <span class="roman">When the user types a valid answer,</span>
          ;;   <span class="roman">it is displayed after the question:</span>
          
          ---------- Echo area ----------
          Do you need a lift? (y or n) y
          ---------- Echo area ----------
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">We show successive lines of echo area messages, but only one actually
appears on the screen at a time. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>y-or-n-p-with-timeout</b><var> prompt seconds default-value<a name="index-y_002dor_002dn_002dp_002dwith_002dtimeout-1166"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Like <code>y-or-n-p</code>, except that if the user fails to answer within
<var>seconds</var> seconds, this function stops waiting and returns
<var>default-value</var>.  It works by setting up a timer; see <a href="Timers.html#Timers">Timers</a>. 
The argument <var>seconds</var> may be an integer or a floating point number. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>yes-or-no-p</b><var> prompt<a name="index-yes_002dor_002dno_002dp-1167"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function asks the user a question, expecting input in the
minibuffer.  It returns <code>t</code> if the user enters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">yes</span></samp>&rsquo;,
<code>nil</code> if the user types &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">no</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The user must type &lt;RET&gt; to
finalize the response.  Upper and lower case are equivalent.

        <p><code>yes-or-no-p</code> starts by displaying <var>prompt</var> in the echo area,
followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(yes&nbsp;or&nbsp;no)&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  The user must type one of the
expected responses; otherwise, the function responds &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Please answer
yes or no.</span></samp>&rsquo;, waits about two seconds and repeats the request.

        <p><code>yes-or-no-p</code> requires more work from the user than
<code>y-or-n-p</code> and is appropriate for more crucial decisions.

        <p>Here is an example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (yes-or-no-p "Do you really want to remove everything? ")
          
          ;; <span class="roman">After evaluation of the preceding expression,</span>
          ;;   <span class="roman">the following prompt appears,</span>
          ;;   <span class="roman">with an empty minibuffer:</span>
          
          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
          Do you really want to remove everything? (yes or no)
          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">If the user first types <kbd>y &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, which is invalid because this
function demands the entire word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">yes</span></samp>&rsquo;, it responds by displaying
these prompts, with a brief pause between them:

     <pre class="smallexample">          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
          Please answer yes or no.
          Do you really want to remove everything? (yes or no)
          ---------- Buffer: minibuffer ----------
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
