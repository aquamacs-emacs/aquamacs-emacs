<h3 class="section">28.14 Horizontal Scrolling</h3>

<p><a name="index-horizontal-scrolling-2152"></a>
  <dfn>Horizontal scrolling</dfn> means shifting the image in the window left
or right by a specified multiple of the normal character width.  Each
window has a <dfn>horizontal scroll position</dfn>, which is a number, never
less than zero.  It specifies how far to shift the contents left. 
Shifting the window contents left generally makes all or part of some
characters disappear off the left, and all or part of some other
characters appear at the right.  The usual value is zero.

   <p>The horizontal scroll position is measured in units of the normal
character width, which is the width of space in the default font.  Thus,
if the value is 5, that means the window contents are scrolled left by 5
times the normal character width.  How many characters actually
disappear off to the left depends on their width, and could vary from
line to line.

   <p>Because we read from side to side in the &ldquo;inner loop,&rdquo; and from top
to bottom in the &ldquo;outer loop,&rdquo; the effect of horizontal scrolling is
not like that of textual or vertical scrolling.  Textual scrolling
involves selection of a portion of text to display, and vertical
scrolling moves the window contents contiguously; but horizontal
scrolling causes part of <em>each line</em> to go off screen.

   <p>Usually, no horizontal scrolling is in effect; then the leftmost
column is at the left edge of the window.  In this state, scrolling to
the right is meaningless, since there is no data to the left of the edge
to be revealed by it; so this is not allowed.  Scrolling to the left is
allowed; it scrolls the first columns of text off the edge of the window
and can reveal additional columns on the right that were truncated
before.  Once a window has a nonzero amount of leftward horizontal
scrolling, you can scroll it back to the right, but only so far as to
reduce the net horizontal scroll to zero.  There is no limit to how far
left you can scroll, but eventually all the text will disappear off the
left edge.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dhscroll_002dmode-2153"></a>  If <code>auto-hscroll-mode</code> is set, redisplay automatically alters
the horizontal scrolling of a window as necessary to ensure that point
is always visible.  However, you can still set the horizontal
scrolling value explicitly.  The value you specify serves as a lower
bound for automatic scrolling, i.e. automatic scrolling will not
scroll a window to a column less than the specified one.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>scroll-left</b><var> &amp;optional count set-minimum<a name="index-scroll_002dleft-2154"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function scrolls the selected window <var>count</var> columns to the
left (or to the right if <var>count</var> is negative).  The default
for <var>count</var> is the window width, minus 2.

        <p>The return value is the total amount of leftward horizontal scrolling in
effect after the change&mdash;just like the value returned by
<code>window-hscroll</code> (below).

        <p>Once you scroll a window as far right as it can go, back to its normal
position where the total leftward scrolling is zero, attempts to scroll
any farther right have no effect.

        <p>If <var>set-minimum</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the new scroll amount becomes
the lower bound for automatic scrolling; that is, automatic scrolling
will not scroll a window to a column less than the value returned by
this function.  Interactive calls pass non-<code>nil</code> for
<var>set-minimum</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>scroll-right</b><var> &amp;optional count set-minimum<a name="index-scroll_002dright-2155"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function scrolls the selected window <var>count</var> columns to the
right (or to the left if <var>count</var> is negative).  The default
for <var>count</var> is the window width, minus 2.  Aside from the direction
of scrolling, this works just like <code>scroll-left</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-hscroll</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dhscroll-2156"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the total leftward horizontal scrolling of
<var>window</var>&mdash;the number of columns by which the text in <var>window</var>
is scrolled left past the left margin.  The default for
<var>window</var> is the selected window.

        <p>The return value is never negative.  It is zero when no horizontal
scrolling has been done in <var>window</var> (which is usually the case).

     <pre class="example">          (window-hscroll)
               &rArr; 0
          (scroll-left 5)
               &rArr; 5
          (window-hscroll)
               &rArr; 5
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-window-hscroll</b><var> window columns<a name="index-set_002dwindow_002dhscroll-2157"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets horizontal scrolling of <var>window</var>.  The value of
<var>columns</var> specifies the amount of scrolling, in terms of columns
from the left margin.  The argument <var>columns</var> should be zero or
positive; if not, it is taken as zero.  Fractional values of
<var>columns</var> are not supported at present.

        <p>Note that <code>set-window-hscroll</code> may appear not to work if you test
it by evaluating a call with <kbd>M-:</kbd> in a simple way.  What happens
is that the function sets the horizontal scroll value and returns, but
then redisplay adjusts the horizontal scrolling to make point visible,
and this overrides what the function did.  You can observe the
function's effect if you call it while point is sufficiently far from
the left margin that it will remain visible.

        <p>The value returned is <var>columns</var>.

     <pre class="example">          (set-window-hscroll (selected-window) 10)
               &rArr; 10
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>Here is how you can determine whether a given position <var>position</var>
is off the screen due to horizontal scrolling:

<pre class="example">     (defun hscroll-on-screen (window position)
       (save-excursion
         (goto-char position)
         (and
          (&gt;= (- (current-column) (window-hscroll window)) 0)
          (&lt; (- (current-column) (window-hscroll window))
             (window-width window)))))
</pre>
