<h4 class="subsection">22.17.2 Menus and the Mouse</h4>

<p>The usual way to make a menu keymap produce a menu is to make it the
definition of a prefix key.  (A Lisp program can explicitly pop up a
menu and receive the user's choice&mdash;see <a href="Pop_002dUp-Menus.html#Pop_002dUp-Menus">Pop-Up Menus</a>.)

   <p>If the prefix key ends with a mouse event, Emacs handles the menu keymap
by popping up a visible menu, so that the user can select a choice with
the mouse.  When the user clicks on a menu item, the event generated is
whatever character or symbol has the binding that brought about that
menu item.  (A menu item may generate a series of events if the menu has
multiple levels or comes from the menu bar.)

   <p>It's often best to use a button-down event to trigger the menu.  Then
the user can select a menu item by releasing the button.

   <p>A single keymap can appear as multiple menu panes, if you explicitly
arrange for this.  The way to do this is to make a keymap for each pane,
then create a binding for each of those maps in the main keymap of the
menu.  Give each of these bindings an item string that starts with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The rest of the item string becomes the name of the pane. 
See the file <samp><span class="file">lisp/mouse.el</span></samp> for an example of this.  Any ordinary
bindings with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;-less item strings are grouped into one pane,
which appears along with the other panes explicitly created for the
submaps.

   <p>X toolkit menus don't have panes; instead, they can have submenus. 
Every nested keymap becomes a submenu, whether the item string starts
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; or not.  In a toolkit version of Emacs, the only thing
special about &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of an item string is that the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; doesn't appear in the menu item.

   <p>Multiple keymaps that define the same menu prefix key produce
separate panes or separate submenus.
