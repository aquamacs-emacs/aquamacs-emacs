<h3 class="section">23.1 Hooks</h3>

<p><a name="index-hooks-1574"></a>
  A <dfn>hook</dfn> is a variable where you can store a function or functions
to be called on a particular occasion by an existing program.  Emacs
provides hooks for the sake of customization.  Most often, hooks are set
up in the init file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>), but Lisp programs can set them also. 
See <a href="Standard-Hooks.html#Standard-Hooks">Standard Hooks</a>, for a list of standard hook variables.

   <p><a name="index-normal-hook-1575"></a>  Most of the hooks in Emacs are <dfn>normal hooks</dfn>.  These variables
contain lists of functions to be called with no arguments.  By
convention, whenever the hook name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>&rsquo;, that tells
you it is normal.  We try to make all hooks normal, as much as
possible, so that you can use them in a uniform way.

   <p>Every major mode function is supposed to run a normal hook called
the <dfn>mode hook</dfn> as the one of the last steps of initialization. 
This makes it easy for a user to customize the behavior of the mode,
by overriding the buffer-local variable assignments already made by
the mode.  Most minor mode functions also run a mode hook at the end. 
But hooks are used in other contexts too.  For example, the hook
<code>suspend-hook</code> runs just before Emacs suspends itself
(see <a href="Suspending-Emacs.html#Suspending-Emacs">Suspending Emacs</a>).

   <p>The recommended way to add a hook function to a normal hook is by
calling <code>add-hook</code> (see below).  The hook functions may be any of
the valid kinds of functions that <code>funcall</code> accepts (see <a href="What-Is-a-Function.html#What-Is-a-Function">What Is a Function</a>).  Most normal hook variables are initially void;
<code>add-hook</code> knows how to deal with this.  You can add hooks either
globally or buffer-locally with <code>add-hook</code>.

   <p><a name="index-abnormal-hook-1576"></a>  If the hook variable's name does not end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>&rsquo;, that
indicates it is probably an <dfn>abnormal hook</dfn>.  That means the hook
functions are called with arguments, or their return values are used
in some way.  The hook's documentation says how the functions are
called.  You can use <code>add-hook</code> to add a function to an abnormal
hook, but you must write the function to follow the hook's calling
convention.

   <p>By convention, abnormal hook names end in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-functions</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hooks</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If the variable's name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-function</span></samp>&rsquo;, then
its value is just a single function, not a list of functions.
