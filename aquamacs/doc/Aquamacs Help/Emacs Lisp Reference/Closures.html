<h3 class="section">12.9 Closures</h3>

<p>As explained in <a href="Variable-Scoping.html#Variable-Scoping">Variable Scoping</a>, Emacs can optionally enable
lexical binding of variables.  When lexical binding is enabled, any
named function that you create (e.g., with <code>defun</code>), as well as
any anonymous function that you create using the <code>lambda</code> macro
or the <code>function</code> special form or the <code>#'</code> syntax
(see <a href="Anonymous-Functions.html#Anonymous-Functions">Anonymous Functions</a>), is automatically converted into a
<dfn>closure</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-closure-765"></a>  A closure is a function that also carries a record of the lexical
environment that existed when the function was defined.  When it is
invoked, any lexical variable references within its definition use the
retained lexical environment.  In all other respects, closures behave
much like ordinary functions; in particular, they can be called in the
same way as ordinary functions.

   <p>See <a href="Lexical-Binding.html#Lexical-Binding">Lexical Binding</a>, for an example of using a closure.

   <p>Currently, an Emacs Lisp closure object is represented by a list
with the symbol <code>closure</code> as the first element, a list
representing the lexical environment as the second element, and the
argument list and body forms as the remaining elements:

<pre class="example">     ;; <span class="roman">lexical binding is enabled.</span>
     (lambda (x) (* x x))
          &rArr; (closure (t) (x) (* x x))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">However, the fact that the internal structure of a closure is
&ldquo;exposed&rdquo; to the rest of the Lisp world is considered an internal
implementation detail.  For this reason, we recommend against directly
examining or altering the structure of closure objects.
