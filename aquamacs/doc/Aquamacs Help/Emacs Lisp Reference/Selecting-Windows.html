<h3 class="section">28.4 Selecting Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-selecting-a-window-2057"></a>
  When a window is selected, the buffer in the window becomes the current
buffer, and the cursor will appear in it.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>selected-window</b><var><a name="index-selected_002dwindow-2058"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the selected window.  This is the window in
which the cursor appears and to which many commands apply. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>select-window</b><var> window &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-select_002dwindow-2059"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes <var>window</var> the selected window.  The cursor then
appears in <var>window</var> (after redisplay).  Unless <var>window</var> was
already selected, <code>select-window</code> makes <var>window</var>'s buffer the
current buffer.  The return value is <var>window</var>.

        <p>Normally, <var>window</var>'s selected buffer is moved to the front of the
buffer list (see <a href="The-Buffer-List.html#The-Buffer-List">The Buffer List</a>) and <var>window</var> becomes the most
recently selected window.  But if <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the
buffer list remains unchanged and <var>window</var> does not become the most
recently selected one.

     <pre class="example">          (setq w (next-window))
          (select-window w)
               &rArr; #&lt;window 65 on windows.texi&gt;
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>save-selected-window</b><var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-save_002dselected_002dwindow-2060"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro records the selected frame, as well as the selected window
of each frame, executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then restores the
earlier selected frame and windows.  It also saves and restores the
current buffer.  It returns the value of the last form in <var>forms</var>.

        <p>This macro does not save or restore anything about the sizes,
arrangement or contents of windows; therefore, if <var>forms</var> change
them, the change persists.  If the previously selected window of some
frame is no longer live at the time of exit from <var>forms</var>, that
frame's selected window is left alone.  If the previously selected
window is no longer live, then whatever window is selected at the end of
<var>forms</var> remains selected.  The current buffer is restored if and
only if it is still live when exiting <var>forms</var>.

        <p>This macro changes neither the ordering of recently selected windows nor
the buffer list. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>with-selected-window</b><var> window forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002dselected_002dwindow-2061"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro selects <var>window</var>, executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then
restores the previously selected window and current buffer.  The ordering
of recently selected windows and the buffer list remain unchanged unless
you deliberately change them within <var>forms</var>, for example, by calling
<code>select-window</code> with argument <var>norecord</var> <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-finding-windows-2062"></a>  The following functions choose one of the windows on the screen,
offering various criteria for the choice.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>get-lru-window</b><var> &amp;optional frame dedicated<a name="index-get_002dlru_002dwindow-2063"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the window least recently &ldquo;used&rdquo; (that is,
selected) among a set of candidate windows.  If any full-width windows
are present, it only considers these.

        <p>The selected window is returned if it is the only candidate.  A
minibuffer window is never a candidate.  A dedicated window
(see <a href="Dedicated-Windows.html#Dedicated-Windows">Dedicated Windows</a>) is never a candidate unless the optional
argument <var>dedicated</var> is non-<code>nil</code>.

        <p>The optional argument <var>frame</var> specifies which windows are
considered.

          <ul>
<li>If it is <code>nil</code>, consider windows on the selected frame. 
<li>If it is <code>t</code>, consider windows on all frames. 
<li>If it is <code>visible</code>, consider windows on all visible frames. 
<li>If it is 0, consider windows on all visible or iconified frames. 
<li>If it is a frame, consider windows on that frame. 
</ul>
        </p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>get-largest-window</b><var> &amp;optional frame dedicated<a name="index-get_002dlargest_002dwindow-2064"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the window with the largest area (height times
width).  If there are no side-by-side windows, then this is the window
with the most lines.  A minibuffer window is never a candidate.  A
dedicated window (see <a href="Dedicated-Windows.html#Dedicated-Windows">Dedicated Windows</a>) is never a candidate unless
the optional argument <var>dedicated</var> is non-<code>nil</code>.

        <p>If there are two candidate windows of the same size, this function
prefers the one that comes first in the cyclic ordering of windows,
starting from the selected window (see <a href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html#Cyclic-Window-Ordering">Cyclic Window Ordering</a>).

        <p>The optional argument <var>frame</var> specifies which set of windows to
consider, see <code>get-lru-window</code> above. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-window-that-satisfies-a-predicate-2065"></a><a name="index-conditional-selection-of-windows-2066"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>get-window-with-predicate</b><var> predicate &amp;optional minibuf all-frames default<a name="index-get_002dwindow_002dwith_002dpredicate-2067"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a window satisfying <var>predicate</var>.  It cycles
through all visible windows using <code>walk-windows</code> (see <a href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html#Cyclic-Window-Ordering">Cyclic Window Ordering</a>), calling <var>predicate</var> on each one of them with that
window as its argument.  The function returns the first window for which
<var>predicate</var> returns a non-<code>nil</code> value; if that never happens,
it returns <var>default</var> (which defaults to <code>nil</code>).

        <p>The optional arguments <var>minibuf</var> and <var>all-frames</var> specify the
set of windows to include in the scan.  See the description of
<code>next-window</code> in <a href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html#Cyclic-Window-Ordering">Cyclic Window Ordering</a>, for details.
