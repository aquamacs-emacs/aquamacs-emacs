<h4 class="subsection">32.19.9 Defining and Using Fields</h4>

<p><a name="index-fields-2730"></a>
  A field is a range of consecutive characters in the buffer that are
identified by having the same value (comparing with <code>eq</code>) of the
<code>field</code> property (either a text-property or an overlay property). 
This section describes special functions that are available for
operating on fields.

   <p>You specify a field with a buffer position, <var>pos</var>.  We think of
each field as containing a range of buffer positions, so the position
you specify stands for the field containing that position.

   <p>When the characters before and after <var>pos</var> are part of the same
field, there is no doubt which field contains <var>pos</var>: the one those
characters both belong to.  When <var>pos</var> is at a boundary between
fields, which field it belongs to depends on the stickiness of the
<code>field</code> properties of the two surrounding characters (see <a href="Sticky-Properties.html#Sticky-Properties">Sticky Properties</a>).  The field whose property would be inherited by text
inserted at <var>pos</var> is the field that contains <var>pos</var>.

   <p>There is an anomalous case where newly inserted text at <var>pos</var>
would not inherit the <code>field</code> property from either side.  This
happens if the previous character's <code>field</code> property is not
rear-sticky, and the following character's <code>field</code> property is not
front-sticky.  In this case, <var>pos</var> belongs to neither the preceding
field nor the following field; the field functions treat it as belonging
to an empty field whose beginning and end are both at <var>pos</var>.

   <p>In all of these functions, if <var>pos</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, the
value of point is used by default.  If narrowing is in effect, then
<var>pos</var> should fall within the accessible portion.  See <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>field-beginning</b><var> &amp;optional pos escape-from-edge limit<a name="index-field_002dbeginning-2731"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the beginning of the field specified by <var>pos</var>.

        <p>If <var>pos</var> is at the beginning of its field, and
<var>escape-from-edge</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then the return value is
always the beginning of the preceding field that <em>ends</em> at <var>pos</var>,
regardless of the stickiness of the <code>field</code> properties around
<var>pos</var>.

        <p>If <var>limit</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it is a buffer position; if the
beginning of the field is before <var>limit</var>, then <var>limit</var> will be
returned instead. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>field-end</b><var> &amp;optional pos escape-from-edge limit<a name="index-field_002dend-2732"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the end of the field specified by <var>pos</var>.

        <p>If <var>pos</var> is at the end of its field, and <var>escape-from-edge</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, then the return value is always the end of the following
field that <em>begins</em> at <var>pos</var>, regardless of the stickiness of
the <code>field</code> properties around <var>pos</var>.

        <p>If <var>limit</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it is a buffer position; if the end
of the field is after <var>limit</var>, then <var>limit</var> will be returned
instead. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>field-string</b><var> &amp;optional pos<a name="index-field_002dstring-2733"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the contents of the field specified by <var>pos</var>,
as a string. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>field-string-no-properties</b><var> &amp;optional pos<a name="index-field_002dstring_002dno_002dproperties-2734"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the contents of the field specified by <var>pos</var>,
as a string, discarding text properties. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>delete-field</b><var> &amp;optional pos<a name="index-delete_002dfield-2735"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function deletes the text of the field specified by <var>pos</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>constrain-to-field</b><var> new-pos old-pos &amp;optional escape-from-edge only-in-line inhibit-capture-property<a name="index-constrain_002dto_002dfield-2736"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function &ldquo;constrains&rdquo; <var>new-pos</var> to the field that
<var>old-pos</var> belongs to&mdash;in other words, it returns the position
closest to <var>new-pos</var> that is in the same field as <var>old-pos</var>.

        <p>If <var>new-pos</var> is <code>nil</code>, then <code>constrain-to-field</code> uses
the value of point instead, and moves point to the resulting position
as well as returning it.

        <p>If <var>old-pos</var> is at the boundary of two fields, then the acceptable
final positions depend on the argument <var>escape-from-edge</var>.  If
<var>escape-from-edge</var> is <code>nil</code>, then <var>new-pos</var> must be in
the field whose <code>field</code> property equals what new characters
inserted at <var>old-pos</var> would inherit.  (This depends on the
stickiness of the <code>field</code> property for the characters before and
after <var>old-pos</var>.)  If <var>escape-from-edge</var> is non-<code>nil</code>,
<var>new-pos</var> can be anywhere in the two adjacent fields. 
Additionally, if two fields are separated by another field with the
special value <code>boundary</code>, then any point within this special
field is also considered to be &ldquo;on the boundary.&rdquo;

        <p>Commands like <kbd>C-a</kbd> with no argumemt, that normally move backward
to a specific kind of location and stay there once there, probably
should specify <code>nil</code> for <var>escape-from-edge</var>.  Other motion
commands that check fields should probably pass <code>t</code>.

        <p>If the optional argument <var>only-in-line</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, and
constraining <var>new-pos</var> in the usual way would move it to a different
line, <var>new-pos</var> is returned unconstrained.  This used in commands
that move by line, such as <code>next-line</code> and
<code>beginning-of-line</code>, so that they respect field boundaries only in
the case where they can still move to the right line.

        <p>If the optional argument <var>inhibit-capture-property</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, and <var>old-pos</var> has a non-<code>nil</code> property of that
name, then any field boundaries are ignored.

        <p>You can cause <code>constrain-to-field</code> to ignore all field boundaries
(and so never constrain anything) by binding the variable
<code>inhibit-field-text-motion</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.
