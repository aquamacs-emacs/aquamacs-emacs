<h3 class="section">25.8 File Names</h3>

<p><a name="index-file-names-1838"></a>
  Files are generally referred to by their names, in Emacs as elsewhere. 
File names in Emacs are represented as strings.  The functions that
operate on a file all expect a file name argument.

   <p>In addition to operating on files themselves, Emacs Lisp programs
often need to operate on file names; i.e., to take them apart and to use
part of a name to construct related file names.  This section describes
how to manipulate file names.

   <p>The functions in this section do not actually access files, so they
can operate on file names that do not refer to an existing file or
directory.

   <p>On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, these functions (like the function that
actually operate on files) accept MS-DOS or MS-Windows file-name syntax,
where backslashes separate the components, as well as Unix syntax; but
they always return Unix syntax.  This enables Lisp programs to specify
file names in Unix syntax and work properly on all systems without
change.
