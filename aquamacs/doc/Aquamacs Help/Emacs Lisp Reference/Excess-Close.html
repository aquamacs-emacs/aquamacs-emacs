<h4 class="subsection">18.3.2 Excess Close Parentheses</h4>

<p>To deal with an excess close parenthesis, first go to the beginning
of the file, then type <kbd>C-u -1 C-M-u</kbd> to find the end of the first
unbalanced defun.

   <p>Then find the actual matching close parenthesis by typing <kbd>C-M-f</kbd>
at the beginning of that defun.  This will leave you somewhere short of
the place where the defun ought to end.  It is possible that you will
find a spurious close parenthesis in that vicinity.

   <p>If you don't see a problem at that point, the next thing to do is to
type <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> at the beginning of the defun.  A range of lines will
probably shift left; if so, the missing open parenthesis or spurious
close parenthesis is probably near the first of those lines.  (However,
don't assume this is true; study the code to make sure.)  Once you have
found the discrepancy, undo the <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> with <kbd>C-_</kbd>, since the
old indentation is probably appropriate to the intended parentheses.

   <p>After you think you have fixed the problem, use <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> again.  If
the old indentation actually fits the intended nesting of parentheses,
and you have put back those parentheses, <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> should not change
anything.
