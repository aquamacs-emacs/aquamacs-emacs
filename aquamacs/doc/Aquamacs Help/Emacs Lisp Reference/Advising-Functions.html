<h2 class="chapter">17 Advising Emacs Lisp Functions</h2>

<p><a name="index-advising-functions-873"></a>
  The <dfn>advice</dfn> feature lets you add to the existing definition of
a function, by <dfn>advising the function</dfn>.  This is a cleaner method
for a library to customize functions defined within Emacs&mdash;cleaner
than redefining the whole function.

   <p><a name="index-piece-of-advice-874"></a>  Each function can have multiple <dfn>pieces of advice</dfn>, separately
defined.  Each defined piece of advice can be <dfn>enabled</dfn> or
<dfn>disabled</dfn> explicitly.  All the enabled pieces of advice for any given
function actually take effect when you <dfn>activate</dfn> advice for that
function, or when you define or redefine the function.  Note that
enabling a piece of advice and activating advice for a function
are not the same thing.

   <p><strong>Usage Note:</strong> Advice is useful for altering the behavior of
existing calls to an existing function.  If you want the new behavior
for new calls, or for key bindings, you should define a new function
(or a new command) which uses the existing function.

   <p><strong>Usage note:</strong> Advising a function can cause confusion in
debugging, since people who debug calls to the original function may
not notice that it has been modified with advice.  Therefore, if you
have the possibility to change the code of that function (or ask
someone to do so) to run a hook, please solve the problem that way. 
Advice should be reserved for the cases where you cannot get the
function changed.

   <p>In particular, this means that a file in Emacs should not put advice
on a function in Emacs.  There are currently a few exceptions to this
convention, but we aim to correct them.
