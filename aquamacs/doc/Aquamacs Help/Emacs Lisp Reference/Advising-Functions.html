<h3 class="section">12.10 Advising Emacs Lisp Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-advising-functions-875"></a><a name="index-piece-of-advice-876"></a>
When you need to modify a function defined in another library, or when you need
to modify a hook like <var>foo</var><code>-function</code>, a process filter, or basically
any variable or object field which holds a function value, you can use the
appropriate setter function, such as <code>fset</code> or <code>defun</code> for named
functions, <code>setq</code> for hook variables, or <code>set-process-filter</code> for
process filters, but those are often too blunt, completely throwing away the
previous value.

   <p>The <dfn>advice</dfn> feature lets you add to the existing definition of
a function, by <dfn>advising the function</dfn>.  This is a cleaner method
than redefining the whole function.

   <p>Emacs's advice system provides two sets of primitives for that: the core set,
for function values held in variables and object fields (with the corresponding
primitives being <code>add-function</code> and <code>remove-function</code>) and another
set layered on top of it for named functions (with the main primitives being
<code>advice-add</code> and <code>advice-remove</code>).

   <p>For example, in order to trace the calls to the process filter of a process
<var>proc</var>, you could use:

<pre class="example">     (defun my-tracing-function (proc string)
       (message "Proc %S received %S" proc string))
     
     (add-function :before (process-filter <var>proc</var>) #'my-tracing-function)
</pre>
   <p>This will cause the process's output to be passed to <code>my-tracing-function</code>
before being passed to the original process filter.  <code>my-tracing-function</code>
receives the same arguments as the original function.  When you're done with
it, you can revert to the untraced behavior with:

<pre class="example">     (remove-function (process-filter <var>proc</var>) #'my-tracing-function)
</pre>
   <p>Similarly, if you want to trace the execution of the function named
<code>display-buffer</code>, you could use:

<pre class="example">     (defun his-tracing-function (orig-fun &amp;rest args)
       (message "display-buffer called with args %S" args)
       (let ((res (apply orig-fun args)))
         (message "display-buffer returned %S" res)
         res))
     
     (advice-add 'display-buffer :around #'his-tracing-function)
</pre>
   <p>Here, <code>his-tracing-function</code> is called instead of the original function
and receives the original function (additionally to that function's arguments)
as argument, so it can call it if and when it needs to. 
When you're tired of seeing this output, you can revert to the untraced
behavior with:

<pre class="example">     (advice-remove 'display-buffer #'his-tracing-function)
</pre>
   <p>The arguments <code>:before</code> and <code>:around</code> used in the above examples
specify how the two functions are composed, since there are many different
ways to do it.  The added function is also called a piece of <em>advice</em>.
