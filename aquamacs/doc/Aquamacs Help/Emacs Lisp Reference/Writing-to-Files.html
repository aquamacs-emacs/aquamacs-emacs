<h3 class="section">25.4 Writing to Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-writing-to-files-1774"></a>
  You can write the contents of a buffer, or part of a buffer, directly
to a file on disk using the <code>append-to-file</code> and
<code>write-region</code> functions.  Don't use these functions to write to
files that are being visited; that could cause confusion in the
mechanisms for visiting.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>append-to-file</b><var> start end filename<a name="index-append_002dto_002dfile-1775"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function appends the contents of the region delimited by
<var>start</var> and <var>end</var> in the current buffer to the end of file
<var>filename</var>.  If that file does not exist, it is created.  This
function returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>An error is signaled if <var>filename</var> specifies a nonwritable file,
or a nonexistent file in a directory where files cannot be created.

        <p>When called from Lisp, this function is completely equivalent to:

     <pre class="example">          (write-region start end filename t)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>write-region</b><var> start end filename &amp;optional append visit lockname mustbenew<a name="index-write_002dregion-1776"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function writes the region delimited by <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>
in the current buffer into the file specified by <var>filename</var>.

        <p>If <var>start</var> is <code>nil</code>, then the command writes the entire buffer
contents (<em>not</em> just the accessible portion) to the file and
ignores <var>end</var>.

     <!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
        <p>If <var>start</var> is a string, then <code>write-region</code> writes or appends
that string, rather than text from the buffer.  <var>end</var> is ignored in
this case.

        <p>If <var>append</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then the specified text is appended
to the existing file contents (if any).  If <var>append</var> is an
integer, <code>write-region</code> seeks to that byte offset from the start
of the file and writes the data from there.

        <p>If <var>mustbenew</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <code>write-region</code> asks
for confirmation if <var>filename</var> names an existing file.  If
<var>mustbenew</var> is the symbol <code>excl</code>, then <code>write-region</code>
does not ask for confirmation, but instead it signals an error
<code>file-already-exists</code> if the file already exists.

        <p>The test for an existing file, when <var>mustbenew</var> is <code>excl</code>, uses
a special system feature.  At least for files on a local disk, there is
no chance that some other program could create a file of the same name
before Emacs does, without Emacs's noticing.

        <p>If <var>visit</var> is <code>t</code>, then Emacs establishes an association
between the buffer and the file: the buffer is then visiting that file. 
It also sets the last file modification time for the current buffer to
<var>filename</var>'s modtime, and marks the buffer as not modified.  This
feature is used by <code>save-buffer</code>, but you probably should not use
it yourself.

     <!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
        <p>If <var>visit</var> is a string, it specifies the file name to visit.  This
way, you can write the data to one file (<var>filename</var>) while recording
the buffer as visiting another file (<var>visit</var>).  The argument
<var>visit</var> is used in the echo area message and also for file locking;
<var>visit</var> is stored in <code>buffer-file-name</code>.  This feature is used
to implement <code>file-precious-flag</code>; don't use it yourself unless you
really know what you're doing.

        <p>The optional argument <var>lockname</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, specifies the
file name to use for purposes of locking and unlocking, overriding
<var>filename</var> and <var>visit</var> for that purpose.

        <p>The function <code>write-region</code> converts the data which it writes to
the appropriate file formats specified by <code>buffer-file-format</code>
and also calls the functions in the list
<code>write-region-annotate-functions</code>. 
See <a href="Format-Conversion.html#Format-Conversion">Format Conversion</a>.

        <p>Normally, <code>write-region</code> displays the message &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Wrote
</span><var>filename</var></samp>&rsquo; in the echo area.  If <var>visit</var> is neither <code>t</code>
nor <code>nil</code> nor a string, then this message is inhibited.  This
feature is useful for programs that use files for internal purposes,
files that the user does not need to know about.

&mdash; Macro: <b>with-temp-file</b><var> file body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002dtemp_002dfile-1777"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-with_002dtemp_002dfile"></a>The <code>with-temp-file</code> macro evaluates the <var>body</var> forms with a
temporary buffer as the current buffer; then, at the end, it writes the
buffer contents into file <var>file</var>.  It kills the temporary buffer
when finished, restoring the buffer that was current before the
<code>with-temp-file</code> form.  Then it returns the value of the last form
in <var>body</var>.

        <p>The current buffer is restored even in case of an abnormal exit via
<code>throw</code> or error (see <a href="Nonlocal-Exits.html#Nonlocal-Exits">Nonlocal Exits</a>).

        <p>See also <code>with-temp-buffer</code> in <a href="Definition-of-with_002dtemp_002dbuffer.html#Definition-of-with_002dtemp_002dbuffer">The Current Buffer</a>.
