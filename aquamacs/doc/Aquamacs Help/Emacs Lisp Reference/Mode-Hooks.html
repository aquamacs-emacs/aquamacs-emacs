<h4 class="subsection">23.2.7 Mode Hooks</h4>

<p>Every major mode function should finish by running its mode hook and
the mode-independent normal hook <code>after-change-major-mode-hook</code>. 
It does this by calling <code>run-mode-hooks</code>.  If the major mode is a
derived mode, that is if it calls another major mode (the parent mode)
in its body, it should do this inside <code>delay-mode-hooks</code> so that
the parent won't run these hooks itself.  Instead, the derived mode's
call to <code>run-mode-hooks</code> runs the parent's mode hook too. 
See <a href="Major-Mode-Conventions.html#Major-Mode-Conventions">Major Mode Conventions</a>.

   <p>Emacs versions before Emacs 22 did not have <code>delay-mode-hooks</code>. 
When user-implemented major modes have not been updated to use it,
they won't entirely follow these conventions: they may run the
parent's mode hook too early, or fail to run
<code>after-change-major-mode-hook</code>.  If you encounter such a major
mode, please correct it to follow these conventions.

   <p>When you defined a major mode using <code>define-derived-mode</code>, it
automatically makes sure these conventions are followed.  If you
define a major mode &ldquo;by hand,&rdquo; not using <code>define-derived-mode</code>,
use the following functions to handle these conventions automatically.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>run-mode-hooks</b><var> &amp;rest hookvars<a name="index-run_002dmode_002dhooks-1620"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Major modes should run their mode hook using this function.  It is
similar to <code>run-hooks</code> (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>), but it also runs
<code>after-change-major-mode-hook</code>.

        <p>When this function is called during the execution of a
<code>delay-mode-hooks</code> form, it does not run the hooks immediately. 
Instead, it arranges for the next call to <code>run-mode-hooks</code> to run
them. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>delay-mode-hooks</b><var> body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-delay_002dmode_002dhooks-1621"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>When one major mode command calls another, it should do so inside of
<code>delay-mode-hooks</code>.

        <p>This macro executes <var>body</var>, but tells all <code>run-mode-hooks</code>
calls during the execution of <var>body</var> to delay running their hooks. 
The hooks will actually run during the next call to
<code>run-mode-hooks</code> after the end of the <code>delay-mode-hooks</code>
construct. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>after-change-major-mode-hook</b><var><a name="index-after_002dchange_002dmajor_002dmode_002dhook-1622"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is a normal hook run by <code>run-mode-hooks</code>.  It is run at the
very end of every properly-written major mode function.
