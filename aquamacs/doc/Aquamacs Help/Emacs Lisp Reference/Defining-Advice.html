<h3 class="section">17.2 Defining Advice</h3>

<p><a name="index-defining-advice-875"></a><a name="index-advice_002c-defining-876"></a>
  To define a piece of advice, use the macro <code>defadvice</code>.  A call
to <code>defadvice</code> has the following syntax, which is based on the
syntax of <code>defun</code> and <code>defmacro</code>, but adds more:

   <p><a name="index-defadvice-877"></a>
<pre class="example">     (defadvice <var>function</var> (<var>class</var> <var>name</var>
                              <span class="roman">[</span><var>position</var><span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">[</span><var>arglist</var><span class="roman">]</span>
                              <var>flags</var>...)
       <span class="roman">[</span><var>documentation-string</var><span class="roman">]</span>
       <span class="roman">[</span><var>interactive-form</var><span class="roman">]</span>
       <var>body-forms</var>...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, <var>function</var> is the name of the function (or macro or special
form) to be advised.  From now on, we will write just &ldquo;function&rdquo; when
describing the entity being advised, but this always includes macros and
special forms.

   <p>In place of the argument list in an ordinary definition, an advice
definition calls for several different pieces of information.

   <p><a name="index-class-of-advice-878"></a><a name="index-before_002dadvice-879"></a><a name="index-after_002dadvice-880"></a><a name="index-around_002dadvice-881"></a><var>class</var> specifies the <dfn>class</dfn> of the advice&mdash;one of <code>before</code>,
<code>after</code>, or <code>around</code>.  Before-advice runs before the function
itself; after-advice runs after the function itself; around-advice is
wrapped around the execution of the function itself.  After-advice and
around-advice can override the return value by setting
<code>ad-return-value</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>ad-return-value</b><var><a name="index-ad_002dreturn_002dvalue-882"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>While advice is executing, after the function's original definition has
been executed, this variable holds its return value, which will
ultimately be returned to the caller after finishing all the advice. 
After-advice and around-advice can arrange to return some other value
by storing it in this variable. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The argument <var>name</var> is the name of the advice, a non-<code>nil</code>
symbol.  The advice name uniquely identifies one piece of advice, within all
the pieces of advice in a particular class for a particular
<var>function</var>.  The name allows you to refer to the piece of
advice&mdash;to redefine it, or to enable or disable it.

   <p>The optional <var>position</var> specifies where, in the current list of
advice of the specified <var>class</var>, this new advice should be placed. 
It should be either <code>first</code>, <code>last</code> or a number that specifies
a zero-based position (<code>first</code> is equivalent to 0).  If no position
is specified, the default is <code>first</code>.  Position values outside the
range of existing positions in this class are mapped to the beginning or
the end of the range, whichever is closer.  The <var>position</var> value is
ignored when redefining an existing piece of advice.

   <p>The optional <var>arglist</var> can be used to define the argument list for
the sake of advice.  This becomes the argument list of the combined
definition that is generated in order to run the advice (see <a href="Combined-Definition.html#Combined-Definition">Combined Definition</a>).  Therefore, the advice expressions can use the argument
variables in this list to access argument values.

   <p>The argument list used in advice need not be the same as the argument
list used in the original function, but must be compatible with it, so
that it can handle the ways the function is actually called.  If two
pieces of advice for a function both specify an argument list, they must
specify the same argument list.

   <p>See <a href="Argument-Access-in-Advice.html#Argument-Access-in-Advice">Argument Access in Advice</a>, for more information about argument
lists and advice, and a more flexible way for advice to access the
arguments.

   <p>The remaining elements, <var>flags</var>, are symbols that specify further
information about how to use this piece of advice.  Here are the valid
symbols and their meanings:

     <dl>
<dt><code>activate</code><dd>Activate the advice for <var>function</var> now.  Changes in a function's
advice always take effect the next time you activate advice for the
function; this flag says to do so, for <var>function</var>, immediately after
defining this piece of advice.

     <p><a name="index-forward-advice-883"></a>This flag has no immediate effect if <var>function</var> itself is not defined yet (a
situation known as <dfn>forward advice</dfn>), because it is impossible to
activate an undefined function's advice.  However, defining
<var>function</var> will automatically activate its advice.

     <br><dt><code>protect</code><dd>Protect this piece of advice against non-local exits and errors in
preceding code and advice.  Protecting advice places it as a cleanup in
an <code>unwind-protect</code> form, so that it will execute even if the
previous code gets an error or uses <code>throw</code>.  See <a href="Cleanups.html#Cleanups">Cleanups</a>.

     <br><dt><code>compile</code><dd>Compile the combined definition that is used to run the advice.  This
flag is ignored unless <code>activate</code> is also specified. 
See <a href="Combined-Definition.html#Combined-Definition">Combined Definition</a>.

     <br><dt><code>disable</code><dd>Initially disable this piece of advice, so that it will not be used
unless subsequently explicitly enabled.  See <a href="Enabling-Advice.html#Enabling-Advice">Enabling Advice</a>.

     <br><dt><code>preactivate</code><dd>Activate advice for <var>function</var> when this <code>defadvice</code> is
compiled or macroexpanded.  This generates a compiled advised definition
according to the current advice state, which will be used during
activation if appropriate.  See <a href="Preactivation.html#Preactivation">Preactivation</a>.

     <p>This is useful only if this <code>defadvice</code> is byte-compiled. 
</dl>

   <p>The optional <var>documentation-string</var> serves to document this piece of
advice.  When advice is active for <var>function</var>, the documentation for
<var>function</var> (as returned by <code>documentation</code>) combines the
documentation strings of all the advice for <var>function</var> with the
documentation string of its original function definition.

   <p>The optional <var>interactive-form</var> form can be supplied to change the
interactive behavior of the original function.  If more than one piece
of advice has an <var>interactive-form</var>, then the first one (the one
with the smallest position) found among all the advice takes precedence.

   <p>The possibly empty list of <var>body-forms</var> specifies the body of the
advice.  The body of an advice can access or change the arguments, the
return value, the binding environment, and perform any other kind of
side effect.

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> When you advise a macro, keep in mind that macros are
expanded when a program is compiled, not when a compiled program is run. 
All subroutines used by the advice need to be available when the byte
compiler expands the macro.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-unadvise</b><var> function<a name="index-ad_002dunadvise-884"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command deletes the advice from <var>function</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-unadvise-all</b><var><a name="index-ad_002dunadvise_002dall-885"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command deletes all pieces of advice from all functions. 
</p></blockquote></div>
