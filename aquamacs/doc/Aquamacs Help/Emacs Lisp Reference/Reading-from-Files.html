<h3 class="section">25.3 Reading from Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-reading-from-files-1771"></a>
  You can copy a file from the disk and insert it into a buffer
using the <code>insert-file-contents</code> function.  Don't use the user-level
command <code>insert-file</code> in a Lisp program, as that sets the mark.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>insert-file-contents</b><var> filename &amp;optional visit beg end replace<a name="index-insert_002dfile_002dcontents-1772"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function inserts the contents of file <var>filename</var> into the
current buffer after point.  It returns a list of the absolute file name
and the length of the data inserted.  An error is signaled if
<var>filename</var> is not the name of a file that can be read.

        <p>The function <code>insert-file-contents</code> checks the file contents
against the defined file formats, and converts the file contents if
appropriate and also calls the functions in
the list <code>after-insert-file-functions</code>.  See <a href="Format-Conversion.html#Format-Conversion">Format Conversion</a>. 
Normally, one of the functions in the
<code>after-insert-file-functions</code> list determines the coding system
(see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>) used for decoding the file's contents,
including end-of-line conversion.  However, if the file contains null
bytes, it is by default visited without any code conversions; see
<a href="Lisp-and-Coding-Systems.html#Lisp-and-Coding-Systems">inhibit-null-byte-detection</a>, for how to
control this behavior.

        <p>If <var>visit</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this function additionally marks the
buffer as unmodified and sets up various fields in the buffer so that it
is visiting the file <var>filename</var>: these include the buffer's visited
file name and its last save file modtime.  This feature is used by
<code>find-file-noselect</code> and you probably should not use it yourself.

        <p>If <var>beg</var> and <var>end</var> are non-<code>nil</code>, they should be integers
specifying the portion of the file to insert.  In this case, <var>visit</var>
must be <code>nil</code>.  For example,

     <pre class="example">          (insert-file-contents filename nil 0 500)
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">inserts the first 500 characters of a file.

        <p>If the argument <var>replace</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it means to replace the
contents of the buffer (actually, just the accessible portion) with the
contents of the file.  This is better than simply deleting the buffer
contents and inserting the whole file, because (1) it preserves some
marker positions and (2) it puts less data in the undo list.

        <p>It is possible to read a special file (such as a FIFO or an I/O device)
with <code>insert-file-contents</code>, as long as <var>replace</var> and
<var>visit</var> are <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>insert-file-contents-literally</b><var> filename &amp;optional visit beg end replace<a name="index-insert_002dfile_002dcontents_002dliterally-1773"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function works like <code>insert-file-contents</code> except that it does
not do format decoding (see <a href="Format-Conversion.html#Format-Conversion">Format Conversion</a>), does not do
character code conversion (see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>), does not run
<code>find-file-hook</code>, does not perform automatic uncompression, and so
on. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If you want to pass a file name to another process so that another
program can read the file, use the function <code>file-local-copy</code>; see
<a href="Magic-File-Names.html#Magic-File-Names">Magic File Names</a>.
