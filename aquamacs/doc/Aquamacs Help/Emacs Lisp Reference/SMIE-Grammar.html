<h5 class="subsubsection">23.7.1.3 Defining the Grammar of a Language</h5>

<p>The usual way to define the SMIE grammar of a language is by
defining a new global variable that holds the precedence table by
giving a set of BNF rules. 
For example, the grammar definition for a small Pascal-like language
could look like:
<pre class="example">     (require 'smie)
     (defvar sample-smie-grammar
       (smie-prec2-&gt;grammar
        (smie-bnf-&gt;prec2
         '((id)
           (inst ("begin" insts "end")
                 ("if" exp "then" inst "else" inst)
                 (id ":=" exp)
                 (exp))
           (insts (insts ";" insts) (inst))
           (exp (exp "+" exp)
                (exp "*" exp)
                ("(" exps ")"))
           (exps (exps "," exps) (exp)))
         '((assoc ";"))
         '((assoc ","))
         '((assoc "+") (assoc "*")))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">A few things to note:

     <ul>
<li>The above grammar does not explicitly mention the syntax of function
calls: SMIE will automatically allow any sequence of sexps, such as
identifiers, balanced parentheses, or <code>begin ... end</code> blocks
to appear anywhere anyway. 
<li>The grammar category <code>id</code> has no right hand side: this does not
mean that it can match only the empty string, since as mentioned any
sequence of sexps can appear anywhere anyway. 
<li>Because non terminals cannot appear consecutively in the BNF grammar, it
is difficult to correctly handle tokens that act as terminators, so the
above grammar treats <code>";"</code> as a statement <em>separator</em> instead,
which SMIE can handle very well. 
<li>Separators used in sequences (such as <code>","</code> and <code>";"</code> above)
are best defined with BNF rules such as <code>(foo (foo "separator" foo) ...)</code>
which generate precedence conflicts which are then resolved by giving
them an explicit <code>(assoc "separator")</code>. 
<li>The <code>("(" exps ")")</code> rule was not needed to pair up parens, since
SMIE will pair up any characters that are marked as having paren syntax
in the syntax table.  What this rule does instead (together with the
definition of <code>exps</code>) is to make it clear that <code>","</code> should
not appear outside of parentheses. 
<li>Rather than have a single <em>precs</em> table to resolve conflicts, it is
preferable to have several tables, so as to let the BNF part of the
grammar specify relative precedences where possible. 
<li>Unless there is a very good reason to prefer <code>left</code> or
<code>right</code>, it is usually preferable to mark operators as associative,
using <code>assoc</code>.  For that reason <code>"+"</code> and <code>"*"</code> are
defined above as <code>assoc</code>, although the language defines them
formally as left associative. 
</ul>
