<h3 class="section">28.26 Hooks for Window Scrolling and Changes</h3>

<p><a name="index-hooks-for-window-operations-2472"></a>
This section describes how a Lisp program can take action whenever a
window displays a different part of its buffer or a different buffer. 
There are three actions that can change this: scrolling the window,
switching buffers in the window, and changing the size of the window. 
The first two actions run <code>window-scroll-functions</code>; the last runs
<code>window-size-change-functions</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>window-scroll-functions</b><var><a name="index-window_002dscroll_002dfunctions-2473"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds a list of functions that Emacs should call before
redisplaying a window with scrolling.  Displaying a different buffer in
the window also runs these functions.

        <p>This variable is not a normal hook, because each function is called with
two arguments: the window, and its new display-start position.

        <p>These functions must take care when using <code>window-end</code>
(see <a href="Window-Start-and-End.html#Window-Start-and-End">Window Start and End</a>); if you need an up-to-date value, you
must use the <var>update</var> argument to ensure you get it.

        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> don't use this feature to alter the way the window
is scrolled.  It's not designed for that, and such use probably won't
work. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>window-size-change-functions</b><var><a name="index-window_002dsize_002dchange_002dfunctions-2474"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds a list of functions to be called if the size of any
window changes for any reason.  The functions are called just once per
redisplay, and just once for each frame on which size changes have
occurred.

        <p>Each function receives the frame as its sole argument.  There is no
direct way to find out which windows on that frame have changed size, or
precisely how.  However, if a size-change function records, at each
call, the existing windows and their sizes, it can also compare the
present sizes and the previous sizes.

        <p>Creating or deleting windows counts as a size change, and therefore
causes these functions to be called.  Changing the frame size also
counts, because it changes the sizes of the existing windows.

        <p>You may use <code>save-selected-window</code> in these functions
(see <a href="Selecting-Windows.html#Selecting-Windows">Selecting Windows</a>).  However, do not use
<code>save-window-excursion</code> (see <a href="Window-Configurations.html#Window-Configurations">Window Configurations</a>); exiting
that macro counts as a size change, which would cause these functions
to be called over and over. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>window-configuration-change-hook</b><var><a name="index-window_002dconfiguration_002dchange_002dhook-2475"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A normal hook that is run every time you change the window configuration
of an existing frame.  This includes splitting or deleting windows,
changing the sizes of windows, or displaying a different buffer in a
window.

        <p>The buffer-local part of this hook is run once for each window on the
affected frame, with the relevant window selected and its buffer
current.  The global part is run once for the modified frame, with that
frame selected. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>In addition, you can use <code>jit-lock-register</code> to register a Font
Lock fontification function, which will be called whenever parts of a
buffer are (re)fontified because a window was scrolled or its size
changed.  See <a href="Other-Font-Lock-Variables.html#Other-Font-Lock-Variables">Other Font Lock Variables</a>.
