<h3 class="section">D.8 Conventional Headers for Emacs Libraries</h3>

<p><a name="index-header-comments-3843"></a><a name="index-library-header-comments-3844"></a>
  Emacs has conventions for using special comments in Lisp libraries
to divide them into sections and give information such as who wrote
them.  This section explains these conventions.

   <p>We'll start with an example, a package that is included in the Emacs
distribution.

   <p>Parts of this example reflect its status as part of Emacs; for
example, the copyright notice lists the Free Software Foundation as the
copyright holder, and the copying permission says the file is part of
Emacs.  When you write a package and post it, the copyright holder would
be you (unless your employer claims to own it instead), and you should
get the suggested copying permission from the end of the GNU General
Public License itself.  Don't say your file is part of Emacs
if we haven't installed it in Emacs yet!

   <p>With that warning out of the way, on to the example:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; lisp-mnt.el --- minor mode for Emacs Lisp maintainers
     
     ;; Copyright (C) 1992 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     
     ;; Author: Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;
     ;; Maintainer: Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;
     ;; Created: 14 Jul 1992
     ;; Version: 1.2
     ;; Keywords: docs
     
     ;; This file is part of GNU Emacs.
     ...
     ;; along with GNU Emacs.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
</pre>
   <p>The very first line should have this format:

<pre class="example">     ;;; <var>filename</var> --- <var>description</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The description should be complete in one line.  If the file
needs a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>&rsquo; specification, put it after <var>description</var>.

   <p>After the copyright notice come several <dfn>header comment</dfn> lines,
each beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;; </span><var>header-name</var><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Here is a table of
the conventional possibilities for <var>header-name</var>:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Author</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This line states the name and net address of at least the principal
author of the library.

     <p>If there are multiple authors, you can list them on continuation lines
led by <code>;;</code> and a tab character, like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          ;; Author: Ashwin Ram &lt;Ram-Ashwin@cs.yale.edu&gt;
          ;;      Dave Sill &lt;de5@ornl.gov&gt;
          ;;      Dave Brennan &lt;brennan@hal.com&gt;
          ;;      Eric Raymond &lt;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;
</pre>
     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Maintainer</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This line should contain a single name/address as in the Author line, or
an address only, or the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FSF</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If there is no maintainer
line, the person(s) in the Author field are presumed to be the
maintainers.  The example above is mildly bogus because the maintainer
line is redundant.

     <p>The idea behind the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Author</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Maintainer</span></samp>&rsquo; lines is to make
possible a Lisp function to &ldquo;send mail to the maintainer&rdquo; without
having to mine the name out by hand.

     <p>Be sure to surround the network address with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;...&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; if
you include the person's full name as well as the network address.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Created</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This optional line gives the original creation date of the
file.  For historical interest only.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Version</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If you wish to record version numbers for the individual Lisp program, put
them in this line.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Adapted-By</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>In this header line, place the name of the person who adapted the
library for installation (to make it fit the style conventions, for
example).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Keywords</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This line lists keywords for the <code>finder-by-keyword</code> help command. 
Please use that command to see a list of the meaningful keywords.

     <p>This field is important; it's how people will find your package when
they're looking for things by topic area.  To separate the keywords, you
can use spaces, commas, or both. 
</dl>

   <p>Just about every Lisp library ought to have the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Author</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Keywords</span></samp>&rsquo; header comment lines.  Use the others if they are
appropriate.  You can also put in header lines with other header
names&mdash;they have no standard meanings, so they can't do any harm.

   <p>We use additional stylized comments to subdivide the contents of the
library file.  These should be separated by blank lines from anything
else.  Here is a table of them:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;; Commentary:</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This begins introductory comments that explain how the library works. 
It should come right after the copying permissions, terminated by a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Change Log</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">History</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Code</span></samp>&rsquo; comment line.  This
text is used by the Finder package, so it should make sense in that
context.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;; Documentation:</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This was used in some files in place of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;; Commentary:</span></samp>&rsquo;,
but it is deprecated.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;; Change Log:</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This begins change log information stored in the library file (if you
store the change history there).  For Lisp files distributed with Emacs,
the change history is kept in the file <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> and not in the
source file at all; these files generally do not have a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;; Change
Log:</span></samp>&rsquo; line.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">History</span></samp>&rsquo; is an alternative to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Change Log</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;; Code:</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This begins the actual code of the program.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;; </span><var>filename</var><span class="samp"> ends here</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is the <dfn>footer line</dfn>; it appears at the very end of the file. 
Its purpose is to enable people to detect truncated versions of the file
from the lack of a footer line.
