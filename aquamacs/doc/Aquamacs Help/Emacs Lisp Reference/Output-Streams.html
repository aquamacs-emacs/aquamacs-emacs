<h3 class="section">19.4 Output Streams</h3>

<p><a name="index-stream-_0028for-printing_0029-1042"></a><a name="index-output-stream-1043"></a>
  An output stream specifies what to do with the characters produced
by printing.  Most print functions accept an output stream as an
optional argument.  Here are the possible types of output stream:

     <dl>
<dt><var>buffer</var><dd><a name="index-buffer-output-stream-1044"></a>The output characters are inserted into <var>buffer</var> at point. 
Point advances as characters are inserted.

     <br><dt><var>marker</var><dd><a name="index-marker-output-stream-1045"></a>The output characters are inserted into the buffer that <var>marker</var>
points into, at the marker position.  The marker position advances as
characters are inserted.  The value of point in the buffer has no effect
on printing when the stream is a marker, and this kind of printing
does not move point (except that if the marker points at or before the
position of point, point advances with the surrounding text, as
usual).

     <br><dt><var>function</var><dd><a name="index-function-output-stream-1046"></a>The output characters are passed to <var>function</var>, which is responsible
for storing them away.  It is called with a single character as
argument, as many times as there are characters to be output, and
is responsible for storing the characters wherever you want to put them.

     <br><dt><code>t</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bt_007d-output-stream-1047"></a>The output characters are displayed in the echo area.

     <br><dt><code>nil</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnil_007d-output-stream-1048"></a><code>nil</code> specified as an output stream means to use the value of
<code>standard-output</code> instead; that value is the <dfn>default output
stream</dfn>, and must not be <code>nil</code>.

     <br><dt><var>symbol</var><dd>A symbol as output stream is equivalent to the symbol's function
definition (if any). 
</dl>

   <p>Many of the valid output streams are also valid as input streams.  The
difference between input and output streams is therefore more a matter
of how you use a Lisp object, than of different types of object.

   <p>Here is an example of a buffer used as an output stream.  Point is
initially located as shown immediately before the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo; in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">the</span></samp>&rsquo;.  At the end, point is located directly before that same
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-print-example-1049"></a>
<pre class="example">     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     This is t-!-he contents of foo.
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     
     (print "This is the output" (get-buffer "foo"))
          &rArr; "This is the output"
     
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     This is t
     "This is the output"
     -!-he contents of foo.
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
</pre>
   <p>Now we show a use of a marker as an output stream.  Initially, the
marker is in buffer <code>foo</code>, between the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo; in
the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">the</span></samp>&rsquo;.  At the end, the marker has advanced over the
inserted text so that it remains positioned before the same &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Note that the location of point, shown in the usual fashion, has no
effect.

<pre class="example">     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     This is the -!-output
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     
     (setq m (copy-marker 10))
          &rArr; #&lt;marker at 10 in foo&gt;
     
     (print "More output for foo." m)
          &rArr; "More output for foo."
     
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     This is t
     "More output for foo."
     he -!-output
     ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
     
     m
          &rArr; #&lt;marker at 34 in foo&gt;
</pre>
   <p>The following example shows output to the echo area:

<pre class="example">     (print "Echo Area output" t)
          &rArr; "Echo Area output"
     ---------- Echo Area ----------
     "Echo Area output"
     ---------- Echo Area ----------
</pre>
   <p>Finally, we show the use of a function as an output stream.  The
function <code>eat-output</code> takes each character that it is given and
conses it onto the front of the list <code>last-output</code> (see <a href="Building-Lists.html#Building-Lists">Building Lists</a>).  At the end, the list contains all the characters output, but
in reverse order.

<pre class="example">     (setq last-output nil)
          &rArr; nil
     
     (defun eat-output (c)
       (setq last-output (cons c last-output)))
          &rArr; eat-output
     
     (print "This is the output" 'eat-output)
          &rArr; "This is the output"
     
     last-output
          &rArr; (10 34 116 117 112 116 117 111 32 101 104
         116 32 115 105 32 115 105 104 84 34 10)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now we can put the output in the proper order by reversing the list:

<pre class="example">     (concat (nreverse last-output))
          &rArr; "
     \"This is the output\"
     "
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Calling <code>concat</code> converts the list to a string so you can see its
contents more clearly.
