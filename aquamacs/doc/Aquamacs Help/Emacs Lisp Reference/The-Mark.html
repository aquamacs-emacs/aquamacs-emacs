<h3 class="section">31.7 The Mark</h3>

<p><a name="index-mark_002c-the-2476"></a><a name="index-mark-ring-2477"></a>
  Each buffer has a special marker, which is designated <dfn>the
mark</dfn>.  When a buffer is newly created, this marker exists but does
not point anywhere; this means that the mark &ldquo;doesn't exist&rdquo; in that
buffer yet.  Subsequent commands can set the mark.

   <p>The mark specifies a position to bound a range of text for many
commands, such as <code>kill-region</code> and <code>indent-rigidly</code>.  These
commands typically act on the text between point and the mark, which
is called the <dfn>region</dfn>.  If you are writing a command that
operates on the region, don't examine the mark directly; instead, use
<code>interactive</code> with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; specification.  This provides the
values of point and the mark as arguments to the command in an
interactive call, but permits other Lisp programs to specify arguments
explicitly.  See <a href="Interactive-Codes.html#Interactive-Codes">Interactive Codes</a>.

   <p>Some commands set the mark as a side-effect.  Commands should do
this only if it has a potential use to the user, and never for their
own internal purposes.  For example, the <code>replace-regexp</code> command
sets the mark to the value of point before doing any replacements,
because this enables the user to move back there conveniently after
the replace is finished.

   <p>Once the mark &ldquo;exists&rdquo; in a buffer, it normally never ceases to
exist.  However, it may become <dfn>inactive</dfn>, if Transient Mark mode
is enabled.  The buffer-local variable <code>mark-active</code>, if
non-<code>nil</code>, means that the mark is active.  A command can call the
function <code>deactivate-mark</code> to deactivate the mark directly, or it
can request deactivation of the mark upon return to the editor command
loop by setting the variable <code>deactivate-mark</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p>If Transient Mode is enabled, certain editing commands that normally
apply to text near point, apply instead to the region when the mark is
active.  This is the main motivation for using Transient Mark mode. 
(Another is that this enables highlighting of the region when the mark
is active.  See <a href="Display.html#Display">Display</a>.)

   <p>In addition to the mark, each buffer has a <dfn>mark ring</dfn> which is a
list of markers containing previous values of the mark.  When editing
commands change the mark, they should normally save the old value of the
mark on the mark ring.  The variable <code>mark-ring-max</code> specifies the
maximum number of entries in the mark ring; once the list becomes this
long, adding a new element deletes the last element.

   <p>There is also a separate global mark ring, but that is used only in a
few particular user-level commands, and is not relevant to Lisp
programming.  So we do not describe it here.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>mark</b><var> &amp;optional force<a name="index-mark-2478"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-current-buffer-mark-2479"></a>This function returns the current buffer's mark position as an integer,
or <code>nil</code> if no mark has ever been set in this buffer.

        <p>If Transient Mark mode is enabled, and <code>mark-even-if-inactive</code> is
<code>nil</code>, <code>mark</code> signals an error if the mark is inactive. 
However, if <var>force</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <code>mark</code> disregards
inactivity of the mark, and returns the mark position (or <code>nil</code>)
anyway. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>mark-marker</b><var><a name="index-mark_002dmarker-2480"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the marker that represents the current buffer's
mark.  It is not a copy, it is the marker used internally.  Therefore,
changing this marker's position will directly affect the buffer's
mark.  Don't do that unless that is the effect you want.

     <pre class="example">          (setq m (mark-marker))
               &rArr; #&lt;marker at 3420 in markers.texi&gt;
          (set-marker m 100)
               &rArr; #&lt;marker at 100 in markers.texi&gt;
          (mark-marker)
               &rArr; #&lt;marker at 100 in markers.texi&gt;
</pre>
        <p>Like any marker, this marker can be set to point at any buffer you
like.  If you make it point at any buffer other than the one of which
it is the mark, it will yield perfectly consistent, but rather odd,
results.  We recommend that you not do it! 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-mark</b><var> position<a name="index-set_002dmark-2481"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets the mark to <var>position</var>, and activates the mark. 
The old value of the mark is <em>not</em> pushed onto the mark ring.

        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Use this function only if you want the user to
see that the mark has moved, and you want the previous mark position to
be lost.  Normally, when a new mark is set, the old one should go on the
<code>mark-ring</code>.  For this reason, most applications should use
<code>push-mark</code> and <code>pop-mark</code>, not <code>set-mark</code>.

        <p>Novice Emacs Lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  The mark saves a location for the user's convenience.  An
editing command should not alter the mark unless altering the mark is
part of the user-level functionality of the command.  (And, in that
case, this effect should be documented.)  To remember a location for
internal use in the Lisp program, store it in a Lisp variable.  For
example:

     <pre class="example">          (let ((beg (point)))
            (forward-line 1)
            (delete-region beg (point))).
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>push-mark</b><var> &amp;optional position nomsg activate<a name="index-push_002dmark-2482"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets the current buffer's mark to <var>position</var>, and
pushes a copy of the previous mark onto <code>mark-ring</code>.  If
<var>position</var> is <code>nil</code>, then the value of point is used. 
<code>push-mark</code> returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>The function <code>push-mark</code> normally <em>does not</em> activate the
mark.  To do that, specify <code>t</code> for the argument <var>activate</var>.

        <p>A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Mark set</span></samp>&rsquo; message is displayed unless <var>nomsg</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>pop-mark</b><var><a name="index-pop_002dmark-2483"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function pops off the top element of <code>mark-ring</code> and makes
that mark become the buffer's actual mark.  This does not move point in
the buffer, and it does nothing if <code>mark-ring</code> is empty.  It
deactivates the mark.

        <p>The return value is not meaningful. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>transient-mark-mode</b><var><a name="index-transient_002dmark_002dmode-2484"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable, if non-<code>nil</code>, enables Transient Mark mode.  In
Transient Mark mode, every buffer-modifying primitive sets
<code>deactivate-mark</code>.  As a consequence, most commands that modify
the buffer also deactivate the mark.

        <p>When Transient Mark mode is enabled and the mark is active, many
commands that normally apply to the text near point instead apply to
the region.  Such commands should use the function <code>use-region-p</code>
to test whether they should operate on the region.  See <a href="The-Region.html#The-Region">The Region</a>.

        <p>Lisp programs can set <code>transient-mark-mode</code> to non-<code>nil</code>,
non-<code>t</code> values to enable Transient Mark mode temporarily.  If the
value is <code>lambda</code>, Transient Mark mode is automatically turned
off after any action, such as buffer modification, that would normally
deactivate the mark.  If the value is <code>(only&nbsp;.&nbsp;</code><var>oldval</var><code>)</code><!-- /@w -->,
then <code>transient-mark-mode</code> is set to the value <var>oldval</var> after
any subsequent command that moves point and is not shift-translated
(see <a href="Key-Sequence-Input.html#Key-Sequence-Input">shift-translation</a>), or after any other
action that would normally deactivate the mark. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>mark-even-if-inactive</b><var><a name="index-mark_002deven_002dif_002dinactive-2485"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this is non-<code>nil</code>, Lisp programs and the Emacs user can use the
mark even when it is inactive.  This option affects the behavior of
Transient Mark mode.  When the option is non-<code>nil</code>, deactivation of
the mark turns off region highlighting, but commands that use the mark
behave as if the mark were still active. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>deactivate-mark</b><var><a name="index-deactivate_002dmark-2486"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If an editor command sets this variable non-<code>nil</code>, then the editor
command loop deactivates the mark after the command returns (if
Transient Mark mode is enabled).  All the primitives that change the
buffer set <code>deactivate-mark</code>, to deactivate the mark when the
command is finished.

        <p>To write Lisp code that modifies the buffer without causing
deactivation of the mark at the end of the command, bind
<code>deactivate-mark</code> to <code>nil</code> around the code that does the
modification.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          (let (deactivate-mark)
            (insert " "))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>deactivate-mark</b><var> &amp;optional force<a name="index-deactivate_002dmark-2487"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If Transient Mark mode is enabled or <var>force</var> is non-<code>nil</code>,
this function deactivates the mark and runs the normal hook
<code>deactivate-mark-hook</code>.  Otherwise, it does nothing. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>mark-active</b><var><a name="index-mark_002dactive-2488"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The mark is active when this variable is non-<code>nil</code>.  This
variable is always buffer-local in each buffer.  Do <em>not</em> use the
value of this variable to decide whether a command that normally
operates on text near point should operate on the region instead.  Use
the function <code>use-region-p</code> for that (see <a href="The-Region.html#The-Region">The Region</a>).

<blockquote><p>These normal hooks are run, respectively, when the mark becomes active
and when it becomes inactive.  The hook <code>activate-mark-hook</code> is
also run at the end of a command if the mark is active and it is
possible that the region may have changed.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>handle-shift-selection</b><var><a name="index-handle_002dshift_002dselection-2491"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function implements the &ldquo;shift-selection&rdquo; behavior of
point-motion commands.  See <a href="../emacs/Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>.  It is called automatically by the Emacs command loop
whenever a command with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; character in its <code>interactive</code>
spec is invoked, before the command itself is executed
(see <a href="Interactive-Codes.html#Interactive-Codes">^</a>).

        <p>If <code>shift-select-mode</code> is non-<code>nil</code> and the current command
was invoked via shift translation (see <a href="Key-Sequence-Input.html#Key-Sequence-Input">shift-translation</a>), this function sets the mark and temporarily
activates the region, unless the region was already temporarily
activated in this way.  Otherwise, if the region has been activated
temporarily, it deactivates the mark and restores the variable
<code>transient-mark-mode</code> to its earlier value.
