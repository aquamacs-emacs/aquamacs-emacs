<h4 class="subsection">37.17.2 Network Options</h4>

<p>The following network options can be specified when you create a
network process.  Except for <code>:reuseaddr</code>, you can also set or
modify these options later, using <code>set-network-process-option</code>.

   <p>For a server process, the options specified with
<code>make-network-process</code> are not inherited by the client
connections, so you will need to set the necessary options for each
child connection as it is created.

     <dl>
<dt>:bindtodevice <var>device-name</var><dd>If <var>device-name</var> is a non-empty string identifying a network
interface name (see <code>network-interface-list</code>), only handle
packets received on that interface.  If <var>device-name</var> is <code>nil</code>
(the default), handle packets received on any interface.

     <p>Using this option may require special privileges on some systems.

     <br><dt>:broadcast <var>broadcast-flag</var><dd>If <var>broadcast-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> for a datagram process, the
process will receive datagram packet sent to a broadcast address, and
be able to send packets to a broadcast address.  Ignored for a stream
connection.

     <br><dt>:dontroute <var>dontroute-flag</var><dd>If <var>dontroute-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the process can only send
to hosts on the same network as the local host.

     <br><dt>:keepalive <var>keepalive-flag</var><dd>If <var>keepalive-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> for a stream connection,
enable exchange of low-level keep-alive messages.

     <br><dt>:linger <var>linger-arg</var><dd>If <var>linger-arg</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, wait for successful
transmission of all queued packets on the connection before it is
deleted (see <code>delete-process</code>).  If <var>linger-arg</var> is an
integer, it specifies the maximum time in seconds to wait for queued
packets to be sent before closing the connection.  Default is
<code>nil</code> which means to discard unsent queued packets when the
process is deleted.

     <br><dt>:oobinline <var>oobinline-flag</var><dd>If <var>oobinline-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> for a stream connection,
receive out-of-band data in the normal data stream.  Otherwise, ignore
out-of-band data.

     <br><dt>:priority <var>priority</var><dd>Set the priority for packets sent on this connection to the integer
<var>priority</var>.  The interpretation of this number is protocol
specific, such as setting the TOS (type of service) field on IP
packets sent on this connection.  It may also have system dependent
effects, such as selecting a specific output queue on the network
interface.

     <br><dt>:reuseaddr <var>reuseaddr-flag</var><dd>If <var>reuseaddr-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code> (the default) for a stream
server process, allow this server to reuse a specific port number (see
<code>:service</code>) unless another process on this host is already
listening on that port.  If <var>reuseaddr-flag</var> is <code>nil</code>, there
may be a period of time after the last use of that port (by any
process on the host), where it is not possible to make a new server on
that port.

&mdash; Function: <b>set-network-process-option</b><var> process option value &amp;optional no-error<a name="index-set_002dnetwork_002dprocess_002doption-3283"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets or modifies a network option for network process
<var>process</var>.  See <code>make-network-process</code> for details of options
<var>option</var> and their corresponding values <var>value</var>.  If
<var>no-error</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this function returns <code>nil</code>
instead of signaling an error if <var>option</var> is not a supported
option.  If the function successfully completes, it returns <code>t</code>.

        <p>The current setting of an option is available via the
<code>process-contact</code> function.
