<h4 class="subsection">23.3.2 Keymaps and Minor Modes</h4>

<p>Each minor mode can have its own keymap, which is active when the mode
is enabled.  To set up a keymap for a minor mode, add an element to the
alist <code>minor-mode-map-alist</code>.  See <a href="Definition-of-minor_002dmode_002dmap_002dalist.html#Definition-of-minor_002dmode_002dmap_002dalist">Definition of minor-mode-map-alist</a>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bself_002dinsert_002dcommand_007d_002c-minor-modes-1630"></a>  One use of minor mode keymaps is to modify the behavior of certain
self-inserting characters so that they do something else as well as
self-insert.  In general, this is the only way to do that, since the
facilities for customizing <code>self-insert-command</code> are limited to
special cases (designed for abbrevs and Auto Fill mode).  (Do not try
substituting your own definition of <code>self-insert-command</code> for the
standard one.  The editor command loop handles this function specially.)

   <p>The key sequences bound in a minor mode should consist of <kbd>C-c</kbd>
followed by one of <kbd>.,/?`'"[]\|~!#$%^&amp;*()-_+=</kbd>.  (The other
punctuation characters are reserved for major modes.)
