<h4 class="subsection">23.4.2 The Data Structure of the Mode Line</h4>

<p><a name="index-mode_002dline-construct-1636"></a>
  The mode-line contents are controlled by a data structure called a
<dfn>mode-line construct</dfn>, made up of lists, strings, symbols, and
numbers kept in buffer-local variables.  Each data type has a specific
meaning for the mode-line appearance, as described below.  The same
data structure is used for constructing frame titles (see <a href="Frame-Titles.html#Frame-Titles">Frame Titles</a>) and header lines (see <a href="Header-Lines.html#Header-Lines">Header Lines</a>).

   <p>A mode-line construct may be as simple as a fixed string of text,
but it usually specifies how to combine fixed strings with variables'
values to construct the text.  Many of these variables are themselves
defined to have mode-line constructs as their values.

   <p>Here are the meanings of various data types as mode-line constructs:

     
<a name="index-percent-symbol-in-mode-line-1637"></a>
<dl><dt><var>string</var><dd>A string as a mode-line construct appears verbatim except for
<code>%</code><dfn>-constructs</dfn> in it.  These stand for substitution of
other data; see <a href="_0025_002dConstructs.html#g_t_0025_002dConstructs">%-Constructs</a>.

     <p>If parts of the string have <code>face</code> properties, they control
display of the text just as they would text in the buffer.  Any
characters which have no <code>face</code> properties are displayed, by
default, in the face <code>mode-line</code> or <code>mode-line-inactive</code>
(see <a href="../emacs/Standard-Faces.html#Standard-Faces">Standard Faces</a>).  The
<code>help-echo</code> and <code>local-map</code> properties in <var>string</var> have
special meanings.  See <a href="Properties-in-Mode.html#Properties-in-Mode">Properties in Mode</a>.

     <br><dt><var>symbol</var><dd>A symbol as a mode-line construct stands for its value.  The value of
<var>symbol</var> is used as a mode-line construct, in place of <var>symbol</var>. 
However, the symbols <code>t</code> and <code>nil</code> are ignored, as is any
symbol whose value is void.

     <p>There is one exception: if the value of <var>symbol</var> is a string, it is
displayed verbatim: the <code>%</code>-constructs are not recognized.

     <p>Unless <var>symbol</var> is marked as &ldquo;risky&rdquo; (i.e., it has a
non-<code>nil</code> <code>risky-local-variable</code> property), all text
properties specified in <var>symbol</var>'s value are ignored.  This
includes the text properties of strings in <var>symbol</var>'s value, as
well as all <code>:eval</code> and <code>:propertize</code> forms in it.  (The
reason for this is security: non-risky variables could be set
automatically from file variables without prompting the user.)

     <br><dt><code>(</code><var>string</var> <var>rest</var><code>...)</code><dt><code>(</code><var>list</var> <var>rest</var><code>...)</code><dd>A list whose first element is a string or list means to process all the
elements recursively and concatenate the results.  This is the most
common form of mode-line construct.

     <br><dt><code>(:eval </code><var>form</var><code>)</code><dd>A list whose first element is the symbol <code>:eval</code> says to evaluate
<var>form</var>, and use the result as a string to display.  Make sure this
evaluation cannot load any files, as doing so could cause infinite
recursion.

     <br><dt><code>(:propertize </code><var>elt</var> <var>props</var><code>...)</code><dd>A list whose first element is the symbol <code>:propertize</code> says to
process the mode-line construct <var>elt</var> recursively, then add the text
properties specified by <var>props</var> to the result.  The argument
<var>props</var> should consist of zero or more pairs <var>text-property</var>
<var>value</var>.  (This feature is new as of Emacs 22.1.)

     <br><dt><code>(</code><var>symbol</var> <var>then</var> <var>else</var><code>)</code><dd>A list whose first element is a symbol that is not a keyword specifies
a conditional.  Its meaning depends on the value of <var>symbol</var>.  If
<var>symbol</var> has a non-<code>nil</code> value, the second element,
<var>then</var>, is processed recursively as a mode-line element. 
Otherwise, the third element, <var>else</var>, is processed recursively. 
You may omit <var>else</var>; then the mode-line element displays nothing
if the value of <var>symbol</var> is <code>nil</code> or void.

     <br><dt><code>(</code><var>width</var> <var>rest</var><code>...)</code><dd>A list whose first element is an integer specifies truncation or
padding of the results of <var>rest</var>.  The remaining elements
<var>rest</var> are processed recursively as mode-line constructs and
concatenated together.  When <var>width</var> is positive, the result is
space filled on the right if its width is less than <var>width</var>.  When
<var>width</var> is negative, the result is truncated on the right to
&minus;<var>width</var> columns if its width exceeds &minus;<var>width</var>.

     <p>For example, the usual way to show what percentage of a buffer is above
the top of the window is to use a list like this: <code>(-3 "%p")</code>.
