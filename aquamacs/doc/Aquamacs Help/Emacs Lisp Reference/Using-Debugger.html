<h4 class="subsection">18.1.5 Using the Debugger</h4>

<p>When the debugger is entered, it displays the previously selected
buffer in one window and a buffer named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Backtrace*</span></samp>&rsquo; in another
window.  The backtrace buffer contains one line for each level of Lisp
function execution currently going on.  At the beginning of this buffer
is a message describing the reason that the debugger was invoked (such
as the error message and associated data, if it was invoked due to an
error).

   <p>The backtrace buffer is read-only and uses a special major mode,
Debugger mode, in which letters are defined as debugger commands.  The
usual Emacs editing commands are available; thus, you can switch windows
to examine the buffer that was being edited at the time of the error,
switch buffers, visit files, or do any other sort of editing.  However,
the debugger is a recursive editing level (see <a href="Recursive-Editing.html#Recursive-Editing">Recursive Editing</a>)
and it is wise to go back to the backtrace buffer and exit the debugger
(with the <kbd>q</kbd> command) when you are finished with it.  Exiting
the debugger gets out of the recursive edit and kills the backtrace
buffer.

   <p><a name="index-current-stack-frame-937"></a>  The backtrace buffer shows you the functions that are executing and
their argument values.  It also allows you to specify a stack frame by
moving point to the line describing that frame.  (A stack frame is the
place where the Lisp interpreter records information about a particular
invocation of a function.)  The frame whose line point is on is
considered the <dfn>current frame</dfn>.  Some of the debugger commands
operate on the current frame.  If a line starts with a star, that means
that exiting that frame will call the debugger again.  This is useful
for examining the return value of a function.

   <p>If a function name is underlined, that means the debugger knows
where its source code is located.  You can click <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> on that
name, or move to it and type &lt;RET&gt;, to visit the source code.

   <p>The debugger itself must be run byte-compiled, since it makes
assumptions about how many stack frames are used for the debugger
itself.  These assumptions are false if the debugger is running
interpreted.
