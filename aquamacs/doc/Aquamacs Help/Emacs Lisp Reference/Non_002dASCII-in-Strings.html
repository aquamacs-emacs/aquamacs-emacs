<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.8.2 Non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> Characters in Strings</h5>

<p>You can include a non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> international character in a string
constant by writing it literally.  There are two text representations
for non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters in Emacs strings (and in buffers): unibyte
and multibyte.  If the string constant is read from a multibyte source,
such as a multibyte buffer or string, or a file that would be visited as
multibyte, then the character is read as a multibyte character, and that
makes the string multibyte.  If the string constant is read from a
unibyte source, then the character is read as unibyte and that makes the
string unibyte.

   <p>You can also represent a multibyte non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character with its
character code: use a hex escape, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\x</span><var>nnnnnnn</var></samp>&rsquo;, with as many
digits as necessary.  (Multibyte non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character codes are all
greater than 256.)  Any character which is not a valid hex digit
terminates this construct.  If the next character in the string could be
interpreted as a hex digit, write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> (backslash and space) to
terminate the hex escape&mdash;for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\x8e0\&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> represents
one character, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; with grave accent.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> in a string
constant is just like backslash-newline; it does not contribute any
character to the string, but it does terminate the preceding hex escape.

   <p>You can represent a unibyte non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character with its
character code, which must be in the range from 128 (0200 octal) to
255 (0377 octal).  If you write all such character codes in octal and
the string contains no other characters forcing it to be multibyte,
this produces a unibyte string.  However, using any hex escape in a
string (even for an <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character) forces the string to be
multibyte.

   <p>You can also specify characters in a string by their numeric values
in Unicode, using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\u</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\U</span></samp>&rsquo; (see <a href="Character-Type.html#Character-Type">Character Type</a>).

   <p>See <a href="Text-Representations.html#Text-Representations">Text Representations</a>, for more information about the two
text representations.
