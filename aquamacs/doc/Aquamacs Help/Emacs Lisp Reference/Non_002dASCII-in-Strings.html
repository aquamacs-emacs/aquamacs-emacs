<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.8.2 Non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> Characters in Strings</h5>

<p>There are two text representations for non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters in Emacs strings: multibyte and unibyte (see <a href="Text-Representations.html#Text-Representations">Text Representations</a>).  Roughly speaking, unibyte strings store raw bytes,
while multibyte strings store human-readable text.  Each character in
a unibyte string is a byte, i.e., its value is between 0 and 255.  By
contrast, each character in a multibyte string may have a value
between 0 to 4194303 (see <a href="Character-Type.html#Character-Type">Character Type</a>).  In both cases,
characters above 127 are non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>.

   <p>You can include a non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character in a string constant
by writing it literally.  If the string constant is read from a
multibyte source, such as a multibyte buffer or string, or a file that
would be visited as multibyte, then Emacs reads each
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character as a multibyte character and
automatically makes the string a multibyte string.  If the string
constant is read from a unibyte source, then Emacs reads the
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character as unibyte, and makes the string
unibyte.

   <p>Instead of writing a character literally into a multibyte string,
you can write it as its character code using an escape sequence. 
See <a href="General-Escape-Syntax.html#General-Escape-Syntax">General Escape Syntax</a>, for details about escape sequences.

   <p>If you use any Unicode-style escape sequence &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\uNNNN</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\U00NNNNNN</span></samp>&rsquo; in a string constant (even for an <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
character), Emacs automatically assumes that it is multibyte.

   <p>You can also use hexadecimal escape sequences (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\x</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;) and
octal escape sequences (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;) in string constants. 
<strong>But beware:</strong> If a string constant contains hexadecimal or
octal escape sequences, and these escape sequences all specify unibyte
characters (i.e., less than 256), and there are no other literal
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters or Unicode-style escape sequences in
the string, then Emacs automatically assumes that it is a unibyte
string.  That is to say, it assumes that all non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters occurring in the string are 8-bit raw bytes.

   <p>In hexadecimal and octal escape sequences, the escaped character
code may contain a variable number of digits, so the first subsequent
character which is not a valid hexadecimal or octal digit terminates
the escape sequence.  If the next character in a string could be
interpreted as a hexadecimal or octal digit, write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
(backslash and space) to terminate the escape sequence.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\xe0\&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> represents one character, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; with grave
accent.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> in a string constant is just like
backslash-newline; it does not contribute any character to the string,
but it does terminate any preceding hex escape.
