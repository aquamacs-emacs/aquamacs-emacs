<h3 class="section">8.2 Defining Symbols</h3>

<p><a name="index-definitions-of-symbols-453"></a>
  A <dfn>definition</dfn> in Lisp is a special form that announces your
intention to use a certain symbol in a particular way.  In Emacs Lisp,
you can define a symbol as a variable, or define it as a function (or
macro), or both independently.

   <p>A definition construct typically specifies a value or meaning for the
symbol for one kind of use, plus documentation for its meaning when used
in this way.  Thus, when you define a symbol as a variable, you can
supply an initial value for the variable, plus documentation for the
variable.

   <p><code>defvar</code> and <code>defconst</code> are special forms that define a
symbol as a global variable.  They are documented in detail in
<a href="Defining-Variables.html#Defining-Variables">Defining Variables</a>.  For defining user option variables that can
be customized, use <code>defcustom</code> (see <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>).

   <p><code>defun</code> defines a symbol as a function, creating a lambda
expression and storing it in the function cell of the symbol.  This
lambda expression thus becomes the function definition of the symbol. 
(The term &ldquo;function definition,&rdquo; meaning the contents of the function
cell, is derived from the idea that <code>defun</code> gives the symbol its
definition as a function.)  <code>defsubst</code> and <code>defalias</code> are two
other ways of defining a function.  See <a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions</a>.

   <p><code>defmacro</code> defines a symbol as a macro.  It creates a macro
object and stores it in the function cell of the symbol.  Note that a
given symbol can be a macro or a function, but not both at once, because
both macro and function definitions are kept in the function cell, and
that cell can hold only one Lisp object at any given time. 
See <a href="Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>.

   <p>In Emacs Lisp, a definition is not required in order to use a symbol
as a variable or function.  Thus, you can make a symbol a global
variable with <code>setq</code>, whether you define it first or not.  The real
purpose of definitions is to guide programmers and programming tools. 
They inform programmers who read the code that certain symbols are
<em>intended</em> to be used as variables, or as functions.  In addition,
utilities such as <samp><span class="file">etags</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">make-docfile</span></samp> recognize
definitions, and add appropriate information to tag tables and the
<samp><span class="file">DOC-</span><var>version</var></samp> file.  See <a href="Accessing-Documentation.html#Accessing-Documentation">Accessing Documentation</a>.
