<h3 class="section">16.5 Evaluation During Compilation</h3>

<p>These features permit you to write code to be evaluated during
compilation of a program.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>eval-and-compile</b><var> body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-eval_002dand_002dcompile-862"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This form marks <var>body</var> to be evaluated both when you compile the
containing code and when you run it (whether compiled or not).

        <p>You can get a similar result by putting <var>body</var> in a separate file
and referring to that file with <code>require</code>.  That method is
preferable when <var>body</var> is large.  Effectively <code>require</code> is
automatically <code>eval-and-compile</code>, the package is loaded both when
compiling and executing.

        <p><code>autoload</code> is also effectively <code>eval-and-compile</code> too.  It's
recognized when compiling, so uses of such a function don't produce
&ldquo;not known to be defined&rdquo; warnings.

        <p>Most uses of <code>eval-and-compile</code> are fairly sophisticated.

        <p>If a macro has a helper function to build its result, and that macro
is used both locally and outside the package, then
<code>eval-and-compile</code> should be used to get the helper both when
compiling and then later when running.

        <p>If functions are defined programmatically (with <code>fset</code> say), then
<code>eval-and-compile</code> can be used to have that done at compile-time
as well as run-time, so calls to those functions are checked (and
warnings about &ldquo;not known to be defined&rdquo; suppressed). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>eval-when-compile</b><var> body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-eval_002dwhen_002dcompile-863"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This form marks <var>body</var> to be evaluated at compile time but not when
the compiled program is loaded.  The result of evaluation by the
compiler becomes a constant which appears in the compiled program.  If
you load the source file, rather than compiling it, <var>body</var> is
evaluated normally.

        <p><a name="index-compile_002dtime-constant-864"></a>If you have a constant that needs some calculation to produce,
<code>eval-when-compile</code> can do that at compile-time.  For example,

     <pre class="lisp">          (defvar my-regexp
            (eval-when-compile (regexp-opt '("aaa" "aba" "abb"))))
</pre>
        <p><a name="index-macros_002c-at-compile-time-865"></a>If you're using another package, but only need macros from it (the
byte compiler will expand those), then <code>eval-when-compile</code> can be
used to load it for compiling, but not executing.  For example,

     <pre class="lisp">          (eval-when-compile
            (require 'my-macro-package))  ;; only macros needed from this
</pre>
        <p>The same sort of thing goes for macros and <code>defsubst</code> functions
defined locally and only for use within the file.  They are needed for
compiling the file, but in most cases they are not needed for
execution of the compiled file.  For example,

     <pre class="lisp">          (eval-when-compile
            (unless (fboundp 'some-new-thing)
              (defmacro 'some-new-thing ()
                (compatibility code))))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">This is often good for code that's only a fallback for compatibility
with other versions of Emacs.

        <p><strong>Common Lisp Note:</strong> At top level, <code>eval-when-compile</code> is analogous to the Common
Lisp idiom <code>(eval-when (compile eval) ...)</code>.  Elsewhere, the
Common Lisp &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#.</span></samp>&rsquo; reader macro (but not when interpreting) is closer
to what <code>eval-when-compile</code> does.
