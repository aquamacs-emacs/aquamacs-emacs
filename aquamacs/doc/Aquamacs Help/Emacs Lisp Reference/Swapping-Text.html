<h3 class="section">27.12 Swapping Text Between Two Buffers</h3>

<p><a name="index-swap-text-between-buffers-2033"></a><a name="index-virtual-buffers-2034"></a>
  Specialized modes sometimes need to let the user access from the
same buffer several vastly different types of text.  For example, you
may need to display a summary of the buffer text, in addition to
letting the user access the text itself.

   <p>This could be implemented with multiple buffers (kept in sync when
the user edits the text), or with narrowing (see <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>).  But
these alternatives might sometimes become tedious or prohibitively
expensive, especially if each type of text requires expensive
buffer-global operations in order to provide correct display and
editing commands.

   <p>Emacs provides another facility for such modes: you can quickly swap
buffer text between two buffers with <code>buffer-swap-text</code>.  This
function is very fast because it doesn't move any text, it only
changes the internal data structures of the buffer object to point to
a different chunk of text.  Using it, you can pretend that a group of
two or more buffers are actually a single virtual buffer that holds
the contents of all the individual buffers together.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>buffer-swap-text</b><var> buffer<a name="index-buffer_002dswap_002dtext-2035"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function swaps the text of the current buffer and that of its
argument <var>buffer</var>.  It signals an error if one of the two buffers
is an indirect buffer (see <a href="Indirect-Buffers.html#Indirect-Buffers">Indirect Buffers</a>) or is a base buffer
of an indirect buffer.

        <p>All the buffer properties that are related to the buffer text are
swapped as well: the positions of point and mark, all the markers, the
overlays, the text properties, the undo list, the value of the
<code>enable-multibyte-characters</code> flag (see <a href="Text-Representations.html#Text-Representations">enable-multibyte-characters</a>), etc. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If you use <code>buffer-swap-text</code> on a file-visiting buffer, you
should set up a hook to save the buffer's original text rather than
what it was swapped with.  <code>write-region-annotate-functions</code>
works for this purpose.  You should probably set
<code>buffer-saved-size</code> to &minus;2 in the buffer, so that changes
in the text it is swapped with will not interfere with auto-saving.
