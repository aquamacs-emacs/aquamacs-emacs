<h4 class="subsection">39.2.2 Suspending Emacs</h4>

<p><a name="index-suspending-Emacs-4149"></a>
  On text terminals, it is possible to <dfn>suspend Emacs</dfn>, which
means stopping Emacs temporarily and returning control to its superior
process, which is usually the shell.  This allows you to resume
editing later in the same Emacs process, with the same buffers, the
same kill ring, the same undo history, and so on.  To resume Emacs,
use the appropriate command in the parent shell&mdash;most likely
<code>fg</code>.

   <p><a name="index-controlling-terminal-4150"></a>  Suspending works only on a terminal device from which the Emacs
session was started.  We call that device the <dfn>controlling
terminal</dfn> of the session.  Suspending is not allowed if the
controlling terminal is a graphical terminal.  Suspending is usually
not relevant in graphical environments, since you can simply switch to
another application without doing anything special to Emacs.

<!-- FIXME?  Are there any systems Emacs still supports that do not -->
<!-- have SIGTSTP? -->
   <p><a name="index-SIGTSTP-4151"></a>  Some operating systems (those without <code>SIGTSTP</code>, or MS-DOS) do
not support suspension of jobs; on these systems, &ldquo;suspension&rdquo;
actually creates a new shell temporarily as a subprocess of Emacs. 
Then you would exit the shell to return to Emacs.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>suspend-emacs</b><var> &amp;optional string<a name="index-suspend_002demacs-4152"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function stops Emacs and returns control to the superior process. 
If and when the superior process resumes Emacs, <code>suspend-emacs</code>
returns <code>nil</code> to its caller in Lisp.

        <p>This function works only on the controlling terminal of the Emacs
session; to relinquish control of other tty devices, use
<code>suspend-tty</code> (see below).  If the Emacs session uses more than
one terminal, you must delete the frames on all the other terminals
before suspending Emacs, or this function signals an error. 
See <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html#Multiple-Terminals">Multiple Terminals</a>.

        <p>If <var>string</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, its characters are sent to Emacs's
superior shell, to be read as terminal input. 
<!-- FIXME?  It seems to me that shell does echo STRING. -->
The characters in <var>string</var> are not echoed by the superior shell;
only the results appear.

        <p>Before suspending, <code>suspend-emacs</code> runs the normal hook
<code>suspend-hook</code>.  After the user resumes Emacs,
<code>suspend-emacs</code> runs the normal hook <code>suspend-resume-hook</code>. 
See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

        <p>The next redisplay after resumption will redraw the entire screen,
unless the variable <code>no-redraw-on-reenter</code> is non-<code>nil</code>. 
See <a href="Refresh-Screen.html#Refresh-Screen">Refresh Screen</a>.

        <p>Here is an example of how you could use these hooks:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (add-hook 'suspend-hook
                    (lambda () (or (y-or-n-p "Really suspend? ")
                                   (error "Suspend canceled"))))
          (add-hook 'suspend-resume-hook (lambda () (message "Resumed!")
                                           (sit-for 2)))
</pre>
        <!-- The sit-for prevents the ``nil'' that suspend-emacs returns -->
     <!-- hiding the message. -->
        <p>Here is what you would see upon evaluating <code>(suspend-emacs "pwd")</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          Really suspend? <kbd>y</kbd>
          ---------- Buffer: Minibuffer ----------
          
          ---------- Parent Shell ----------
          bash$ /home/username
          bash$ fg
          
          ---------- Echo Area ----------
          Resumed!
</pre>
        <!-- FIXME?  AFAICS, it is echoed. -->
        <p>Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pwd</span></samp>&rsquo; is not echoed after Emacs is suspended.  But it
is read and executed by the shell.

the terminal for the selected frame).  See <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html#Multiple-Terminals">Multiple Terminals</a>.
