     <ul>
<li><a name="index-mouse_002d2-3826"></a><a name="index-references_002c-following-3827"></a>Many special major modes, like Dired, Info, Compilation, and Occur,
are designed to handle read-only text that contains <dfn>hyper-links</dfn>. 
Such a major mode should redefine <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> and &lt;RET&gt; to
follow the links.  It should also set up a <code>follow-link</code>
condition, so that the link obeys <code>mouse-1-click-follows-link</code>. 
See <a href="Clickable-Text.html#Clickable-Text">Clickable Text</a>.  See <a href="Buttons.html#Buttons">Buttons</a>, for an easy method of
implementing such clickable links.

     <li><a name="index-reserved-keys-3828"></a><a name="index-keys_002c-reserved-3829"></a>Don't define <kbd>C-c </kbd><var>letter</var> as a key in Lisp programs. 
Sequences consisting of <kbd>C-c</kbd> and a letter (either upper or lower
case) are reserved for users; they are the <strong>only</strong> sequences
reserved for users, so do not block them.

     <p>Changing all the Emacs major modes to respect this convention was a
lot of work; abandoning this convention would make that work go to
waste, and inconvenience users.  Please comply with it.

     <li>Function keys &lt;F5&gt; through &lt;F9&gt; without modifier keys are
also reserved for users to define.

     <li>Sequences consisting of <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by a control character or a
digit are reserved for major modes.

     <li>Sequences consisting of <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by <kbd>{</kbd>, <kbd>}</kbd>,
<kbd>&lt;</kbd>, <kbd>&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>:</kbd> or <kbd>;</kbd> are also reserved for major modes.

     <li>Sequences consisting of <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by any other punctuation
character are allocated for minor modes.  Using them in a major mode is
not absolutely prohibited, but if you do that, the major mode binding
may be shadowed from time to time by minor modes.

     <li>Don't bind <kbd>C-h</kbd> following any prefix character (including
<kbd>C-c</kbd>).  If you don't bind <kbd>C-h</kbd>, it is automatically
available as a help character for listing the subcommands of the
prefix character.

     <li>Don't bind a key sequence ending in &lt;ESC&gt; except following another
&lt;ESC&gt;.  (That is, it is OK to bind a sequence ending in
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>.)

     <p>The reason for this rule is that a non-prefix binding for &lt;ESC&gt; in
any context prevents recognition of escape sequences as function keys in
that context.

     <li>Anything which acts like a temporary mode or state which the user can
enter and leave should define <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> or
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> as a way to escape.

     <p>For a state which accepts ordinary Emacs commands, or more generally any
kind of state in which &lt;ESC&gt; followed by a function key or arrow key
is potentially meaningful, then you must not define <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;
&lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>, since that would preclude recognizing an escape sequence
after &lt;ESC&gt;.  In these states, you should define <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;
&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> as the way to escape.  Otherwise, define
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> instead. 
</ul>
