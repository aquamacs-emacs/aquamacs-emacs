<h3 class="section">21.1 Command Loop Overview</h3>

<p>The first thing the command loop must do is read a key sequence, which
is a sequence of events that translates into a command.  It does this by
calling the function <code>read-key-sequence</code>.  Your Lisp code can also
call this function (see <a href="Key-Sequence-Input.html#Key-Sequence-Input">Key Sequence Input</a>).  Lisp programs can also
do input at a lower level with <code>read-event</code> (see <a href="Reading-One-Event.html#Reading-One-Event">Reading One Event</a>) or discard pending input with <code>discard-input</code>
(see <a href="Event-Input-Misc.html#Event-Input-Misc">Event Input Misc</a>).

   <p>The key sequence is translated into a command through the currently
active keymaps.  See <a href="Key-Lookup.html#Key-Lookup">Key Lookup</a>, for information on how this is done. 
The result should be a keyboard macro or an interactively callable
function.  If the key is <kbd>M-x</kbd>, then it reads the name of another
command, which it then calls.  This is done by the command
<code>execute-extended-command</code> (see <a href="Interactive-Call.html#Interactive-Call">Interactive Call</a>).

   <p>Prior to executing the command, Emacs runs <code>undo-boundary</code> to
create an undo boundary.  See <a href="Maintaining-Undo.html#Maintaining-Undo">Maintaining Undo</a>.

   <p>To execute a command, Emacs first reads its arguments by calling
<code>command-execute</code> (see <a href="Interactive-Call.html#Interactive-Call">Interactive Call</a>).  For commands
written in Lisp, the <code>interactive</code> specification says how to read
the arguments.  This may use the prefix argument (see <a href="Prefix-Command-Arguments.html#Prefix-Command-Arguments">Prefix Command Arguments</a>) or may read with prompting in the minibuffer
(see <a href="Minibuffers.html#Minibuffers">Minibuffers</a>).  For example, the command <code>find-file</code> has
an <code>interactive</code> specification which says to read a file name
using the minibuffer.  The function body of <code>find-file</code> does not
use the minibuffer, so if you call <code>find-file</code> as a function from
Lisp code, you must supply the file name string as an ordinary Lisp
function argument.

   <p>If the command is a string or vector (i.e., a keyboard macro) then
<code>execute-kbd-macro</code> is used to execute it.  You can call this
function yourself (see <a href="Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>).

   <p>To terminate the execution of a running command, type <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  This
character causes <dfn>quitting</dfn> (see <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>pre-command-hook</b><var><a name="index-pre_002dcommand_002dhook-1203"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The editor command loop runs this normal hook before each command.  At
that time, <code>this-command</code> contains the command that is about to
run, and <code>last-command</code> describes the previous command. 
See <a href="Command-Loop-Info.html#Command-Loop-Info">Command Loop Info</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>post-command-hook</b><var><a name="index-post_002dcommand_002dhook-1204"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The editor command loop runs this normal hook after each command
(including commands terminated prematurely by quitting or by errors),
and also when the command loop is first entered.  At that time,
<code>this-command</code> refers to the command that just ran, and
<code>last-command</code> refers to the command before that. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Quitting is suppressed while running <code>pre-command-hook</code> and
<code>post-command-hook</code>.  If an error happens while executing one of
these hooks, it terminates execution of the hook, and clears the hook
variable to <code>nil</code> so as to prevent an infinite loop of errors.

   <p>A request coming into the Emacs server (see <a href="../emacs/Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>) runs these two hooks just as a keyboard
command does.
