<h4 class="subsection">38.4.3 Logging Messages in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Messages*</span></samp>&rsquo;</h4>

<p><a name="index-logging-echo_002darea-messages-3347"></a>
  Almost all the messages displayed in the echo area are also recorded
in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Messages*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer so that the user can refer back to
them.  This includes all the messages that are output with
<code>message</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>message-log-max</b><var><a name="index-message_002dlog_002dmax-3348"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable specifies how many lines to keep in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Messages*</span></samp>&rsquo;
buffer.  The value <code>t</code> means there is no limit on how many lines to
keep.  The value <code>nil</code> disables message logging entirely.  Here's
how to display a message and prevent it from being logged:

     <pre class="example">          (let (message-log-max)
            (message ...))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>To make &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Messages*</span></samp>&rsquo; more convenient for the user, the logging
facility combines successive identical messages.  It also combines
successive related messages for the sake of two cases: question
followed by answer, and a series of progress messages.

   <p>A &ldquo;question followed by an answer&rdquo; means two messages like the
ones produced by <code>y-or-n-p</code>: the first is &lsquo;<samp><var>question</var></samp>&rsquo;,
and the second is &lsquo;<samp><var>question</var><span class="samp">...</span><var>answer</var></samp>&rsquo;.  The first
message conveys no additional information beyond what's in the second,
so logging the second message discards the first from the log.

   <p>A &ldquo;series of progress messages&rdquo; means successive messages like
those produced by <code>make-progress-reporter</code>.  They have the form
&lsquo;<samp><var>base</var><span class="samp">...</span><var>how-far</var></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>base</var> is the same each
time, while <var>how-far</var> varies.  Logging each message in the series
discards the previous one, provided they are consecutive.

   <p>The functions <code>make-progress-reporter</code> and <code>y-or-n-p</code>
don't have to do anything special to activate the message log
combination feature.  It operates whenever two consecutive messages
are logged that share a common prefix ending in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo;.
