<h3 class="section">11.5 Defining Global Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-variable-definition-600"></a>
  You may announce your intention to use a symbol as a global variable
with a <dfn>variable definition</dfn>: a special form, either <code>defconst</code>
or <code>defvar</code>.

   <p>In Emacs Lisp, definitions serve three purposes.  First, they inform
people who read the code that certain symbols are <em>intended</em> to be
used a certain way (as variables).  Second, they inform the Lisp system
of these things, supplying a value and documentation.  Third, they
provide information to utilities such as <code>etags</code> and
<code>make-docfile</code>, which create data bases of the functions and
variables in a program.

   <p>The difference between <code>defconst</code> and <code>defvar</code> is primarily
a matter of intent, serving to inform human readers of whether the value
should ever change.  Emacs Lisp does not restrict the ways in which a
variable can be used based on <code>defconst</code> or <code>defvar</code>
declarations.  However, it does make a difference for initialization:
<code>defconst</code> unconditionally initializes the variable, while
<code>defvar</code> initializes it only if it is void.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>defvar</b><var> symbol </var>[<var>value </var>[<var>doc-string</var>]]<var><a name="index-defvar-601"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form defines <var>symbol</var> as a variable and can also
initialize and document it.  The definition informs a person reading
your code that <var>symbol</var> is used as a variable that might be set or
changed.  Note that <var>symbol</var> is not evaluated; the symbol to be
defined must appear explicitly in the <code>defvar</code>.

        <p>If <var>symbol</var> is void and <var>value</var> is specified, <code>defvar</code>
evaluates it and sets <var>symbol</var> to the result.  But if <var>symbol</var>
already has a value (i.e., it is not void), <var>value</var> is not even
evaluated, and <var>symbol</var>'s value remains unchanged.  If <var>value</var>
is omitted, the value of <var>symbol</var> is not changed in any case.

        <p>If <var>symbol</var> has a buffer-local binding in the current buffer,
<code>defvar</code> operates on the default value, which is buffer-independent,
not the current (buffer-local) binding.  It sets the default value if
the default value is void.  See <a href="Buffer_002dLocal-Variables.html#Buffer_002dLocal-Variables">Buffer-Local Variables</a>.

        <p>When you evaluate a top-level <code>defvar</code> form with <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> in
Emacs Lisp mode (<code>eval-defun</code>), a special feature of
<code>eval-defun</code> arranges to set the variable unconditionally, without
testing whether its value is void.

        <p>If the <var>doc-string</var> argument appears, it specifies the documentation
for the variable.  (This opportunity to specify documentation is one of
the main benefits of defining the variable.)  The documentation is
stored in the symbol's <code>variable-documentation</code> property.  The
Emacs help functions (see <a href="Documentation.html#Documentation">Documentation</a>) look for this property.

        <p>If the documentation string begins with the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, Emacs
allows users to set it interactively using the <code>set-variable</code>
command.  However, you should nearly always use <code>defcustom</code>
instead of <code>defvar</code> to define such variables, so that users can
use <kbd>M-x customize</kbd> and related commands to set them.  In that
case, it is not necessary to begin the documentation string with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  See <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>.

        <p>Here are some examples.  This form defines <code>foo</code> but does not
initialize it:

     <pre class="example">          (defvar foo)
               &rArr; foo
</pre>
        <p>This example initializes the value of <code>bar</code> to <code>23</code>, and gives
it a documentation string:

     <pre class="example">          (defvar bar 23
            "The normal weight of a bar.")
               &rArr; bar
</pre>
        <p>The following form changes the documentation string for <code>bar</code>,
making it a user option, but does not change the value, since <code>bar</code>
already has a value.  (The addition <code>(1+ nil)</code> would get an error
if it were evaluated, but since it is not evaluated, there is no error.)

     <pre class="example">          (defvar bar (1+ nil)
            "*The normal weight of a bar.")
               &rArr; bar
          bar
               &rArr; 23
</pre>
        <p>Here is an equivalent expression for the <code>defvar</code> special form:

     <pre class="example">          (defvar <var>symbol</var> <var>value</var> <var>doc-string</var>)
          ==
          (progn
            (if (not (boundp '<var>symbol</var>))
                (setq <var>symbol</var> <var>value</var>))
            (if '<var>doc-string</var>
              (put '<var>symbol</var> 'variable-documentation '<var>doc-string</var>))
            '<var>symbol</var>)
</pre>
        <p>The <code>defvar</code> form returns <var>symbol</var>, but it is normally used
at top level in a file where its value does not matter. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-constant-variables-602"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>defconst</b><var> symbol value </var>[<var>doc-string</var>]<var><a name="index-defconst-603"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form defines <var>symbol</var> as a value and initializes it. 
It informs a person reading your code that <var>symbol</var> has a standard
global value, established here, that should not be changed by the user
or by other programs.  Note that <var>symbol</var> is not evaluated; the
symbol to be defined must appear explicitly in the <code>defconst</code>.

        <p><code>defconst</code> always evaluates <var>value</var>, and sets the value of
<var>symbol</var> to the result.  If <var>symbol</var> does have a buffer-local
binding in the current buffer, <code>defconst</code> sets the default value,
not the buffer-local value.  (But you should not be making
buffer-local bindings for a symbol that is defined with
<code>defconst</code>.)

        <p>Here, <code>pi</code> is a constant that presumably ought not to be changed
by anyone (attempts by the Indiana State Legislature notwithstanding). 
As the second form illustrates, however, this is only advisory.

     <pre class="example">          (defconst pi 3.1415 "Pi to five places.")
               &rArr; pi
          (setq pi 3)
               &rArr; pi
          pi
               &rArr; 3
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>user-variable-p</b><var> variable<a name="index-user_002dvariable_002dp-604"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-user-option-605"></a>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>variable</var> is a user option&mdash;a
variable intended to be set by the user for customization&mdash;and
<code>nil</code> otherwise.  (Variables other than user options exist for the
internal purposes of Lisp programs, and users need not know about them.)

        <p>User option variables are distinguished from other variables either
though being declared using <code>defcustom</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> or by the first character
of their <code>variable-documentation</code> property.  If the property exists
and is a string, and its first character is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the variable
is a user option.  Aliases of user options are also user options. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-variable_002dinteractive-606"></a>  If a user option variable has a <code>variable-interactive</code> property,
the <code>set-variable</code> command uses that value to control reading the
new value for the variable.  The property's value is used as if it were
specified in <code>interactive</code> (see <a href="Using-Interactive.html#Using-Interactive">Using Interactive</a>).  However,
this feature is largely obsoleted by <code>defcustom</code>
(see <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>).

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> If the <code>defconst</code> and <code>defvar</code> special
forms are used while the variable has a local binding (made with
<code>let</code>, or a function argument), they set the local-binding's
value; the top-level binding is not changed.  This is not what you
usually want.  To prevent it, use these special forms at top level in
a file, where normally no local binding is in effect, and make sure to
load the file before making a local binding for the variable.

declared equivalently in <samp><span class="file">cus-start.el</span></samp>.</p>
