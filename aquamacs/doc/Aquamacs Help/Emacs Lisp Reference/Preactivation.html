<p><a name="index-preactivating-advice-911"></a><a name="index-advice_002c-preactivating-912"></a>
  Constructing a combined definition to execute advice is moderately
expensive.  When a library advises many functions, this can make loading
the library slow.  In that case, you can use <dfn>preactivation</dfn> to
construct suitable combined definitions in advance.

   <p>To use preactivation, specify the <code>preactivate</code> flag when you
define the advice with <code>defadvice</code>.  This <code>defadvice</code> call
creates a combined definition which embodies this piece of advice
(whether enabled or not) plus any other currently enabled advice for the
same function, and the function's own definition.  If the
<code>defadvice</code> is compiled, that compiles the combined definition
also.

   <p>When the function's advice is subsequently activated, if the enabled
advice for the function matches what was used to make this combined
definition, then the existing combined definition is used, thus avoiding
the need to construct one.  Thus, preactivation never causes wrong
results&mdash;but it may fail to do any good, if the enabled advice at the
time of activation doesn't match what was used for preactivation.

   <p>Here are some symptoms that can indicate that a preactivation did not
work properly, because of a mismatch.

     <ul>
<li>Activation of the advised
function takes longer than usual. 
<li>The byte compiler gets
loaded while an advised function gets activated. 
<li><code>byte-compile</code> is included in the value of <code>features</code> even
though you did not ever explicitly use the byte compiler. 
</ul>

   <p>Compiled preactivated advice works properly even if the function itself
is not defined until later; however, the function needs to be defined
when you <em>compile</em> the preactivated advice.

   <p>There is no elegant way to find out why preactivated advice is not being
used.  What you can do is to trace the function
<code>ad-cache-id-verification-code</code> (with the function
<code>trace-function-background</code>) before the advised function's advice
is activated.  After activation, check the value returned by
<code>ad-cache-id-verification-code</code> for that function: <code>verified</code>
means that the preactivated advice was used, while other values give
some information about why they were considered inappropriate.

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> There is one known case that can make preactivation
fail, in that a preconstructed combined definition is used even though
it fails to match the current state of advice.  This can happen when two
packages define different pieces of advice with the same name, in the
same class, for the same function.  But you should avoid that anyway.
