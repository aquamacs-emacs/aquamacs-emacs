<h3 class="section">39.10 Timers for Delayed Execution</h3>

<p><a name="index-timer-3783"></a>
  You can set up a <dfn>timer</dfn> to call a function at a specified
future time or after a certain length of idleness.

   <p>Emacs cannot run timers at any arbitrary point in a Lisp program; it
can run them only when Emacs could accept output from a subprocess:
namely, while waiting or inside certain primitive functions such as
<code>sit-for</code> or <code>read-event</code> which <em>can</em> wait.  Therefore, a
timer's execution may be delayed if Emacs is busy.  However, the time of
execution is very precise if Emacs is idle.

   <p>Emacs binds <code>inhibit-quit</code> to <code>t</code> before calling the timer
function, because quitting out of many timer functions can leave
things in an inconsistent state.  This is normally unproblematical
because most timer functions don't do a lot of work.  Indeed, for a
timer to call a function that takes substantial time to run is likely
to be annoying.  If a timer function needs to allow quitting, it
should use <code>with-local-quit</code> (see <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>).  For example, if
a timer function calls <code>accept-process-output</code> to receive output
from an external process, that call should be wrapped inside
<code>with-local-quit</code>, to ensure that <kbd>C-g</kbd> works if the external
process hangs.

   <p>It is usually a bad idea for timer functions to alter buffer
contents.  When they do, they usually should call <code>undo-boundary</code>
both before and after changing the buffer, to separate the timer's
changes from user commands' changes and prevent a single undo entry
from growing to be quite large.

   <p>Timer functions should also avoid calling functions that cause Emacs
to wait, such as <code>sit-for</code> (see <a href="Waiting.html#Waiting">Waiting</a>).  This can lead to
unpredictable effects, since other timers (or even the same timer) can
run while waiting.  If a timer function needs to perform an action
after a certain time has elapsed, it can do this by scheduling a new
timer.

   <p>If a timer function calls functions that can change the match data,
it should save and restore the match data.  See <a href="Saving-Match-Data.html#Saving-Match-Data">Saving Match Data</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>run-at-time</b><var> time repeat function &amp;rest args<a name="index-run_002dat_002dtime-3784"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This sets up a timer that calls the function <var>function</var> with
arguments <var>args</var> at time <var>time</var>.  If <var>repeat</var> is a number
(integer or floating point), the timer is scheduled to run again every
<var>repeat</var> seconds after <var>time</var>.  If <var>repeat</var> is <code>nil</code>,
the timer runs only once.

        <p><var>time</var> may specify an absolute or a relative time.

        <p>Absolute times may be specified using a string with a limited variety
of formats, and are taken to be times <em>today</em>, even if already in
the past.  The recognized forms are &lsquo;<samp><var>xxxx</var></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><var>x</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>xx</var></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><var>xx</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>xx</var></samp>&rsquo; (military time),
and &lsquo;<samp><var>xx</var><span class="samp">am</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><var>xx</var><span class="samp">AM</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><var>xx</var><span class="samp">pm</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><var>xx</var><span class="samp">PM</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><var>xx</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>xx</var><span class="samp">am</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><var>xx</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>xx</var><span class="samp">AM</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><var>xx</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>xx</var><span class="samp">pm</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;<samp><var>xx</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>xx</var><span class="samp">PM</span></samp>&rsquo;.  A period can be used instead of a colon
to separate the hour and minute parts.

        <p>To specify a relative time as a string, use numbers followed by units. 
For example:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 min</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>denotes 1 minute from now. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 min 5 sec</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>denotes 65 seconds from now. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 min 2 sec 3 hour 4 day 5 week 6 fortnight 7 month 8 year</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>denotes exactly 103 months, 123 days, and 10862 seconds from now. 
</dl>

        <p>For relative time values, Emacs considers a month to be exactly thirty
days, and a year to be exactly 365.25 days.

        <p>Not all convenient formats are strings.  If <var>time</var> is a number
(integer or floating point), that specifies a relative time measured in
seconds.  The result of <code>encode-time</code> can also be used to specify
an absolute value for <var>time</var>.

        <p>In most cases, <var>repeat</var> has no effect on when <em>first</em> call
takes place&mdash;<var>time</var> alone specifies that.  There is one exception:
if <var>time</var> is <code>t</code>, then the timer runs whenever the time is a
multiple of <var>repeat</var> seconds after the epoch.  This is useful for
functions like <code>display-time</code>.

        <p>The function <code>run-at-time</code> returns a timer value that identifies
the particular scheduled future action.  You can use this value to call
<code>cancel-timer</code> (see below). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>A repeating timer nominally ought to run every <var>repeat</var> seconds,
but remember that any invocation of a timer can be late.  Lateness of
one repetition has no effect on the scheduled time of the next
repetition.  For instance, if Emacs is busy computing for long enough
to cover three scheduled repetitions of the timer, and then starts to
wait, it will immediately call the timer function three times in
immediate succession (presuming no other timers trigger before or
between them).  If you want a timer to run again no less than <var>n</var>
seconds after the last invocation, don't use the <var>repeat</var> argument. 
Instead, the timer function should explicitly reschedule the timer.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>timer-max-repeats</b><var><a name="index-timer_002dmax_002drepeats-3785"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable's value specifies the maximum number of times to repeat
calling a timer function in a row, when many previously scheduled
calls were unavoidably delayed. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>with-timeout</b> (<var>seconds timeout-forms<small class="dots">...</small></var>)<var> body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002dtimeout-3786"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Execute <var>body</var>, but give up after <var>seconds</var> seconds.  If
<var>body</var> finishes before the time is up, <code>with-timeout</code> returns
the value of the last form in <var>body</var>.  If, however, the execution of
<var>body</var> is cut short by the timeout, then <code>with-timeout</code>
executes all the <var>timeout-forms</var> and returns the value of the last
of them.

        <p>This macro works by setting a timer to run after <var>seconds</var> seconds.  If
<var>body</var> finishes before that time, it cancels the timer.  If the
timer actually runs, it terminates execution of <var>body</var>, then
executes <var>timeout-forms</var>.

        <p>Since timers can run within a Lisp program only when the program calls a
primitive that can wait, <code>with-timeout</code> cannot stop executing
<var>body</var> while it is in the midst of a computation&mdash;only when it
calls one of those primitives.  So use <code>with-timeout</code> only with a
<var>body</var> that waits for input, not one that does a long computation. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The function <code>y-or-n-p-with-timeout</code> provides a simple way to use
a timer to avoid waiting too long for an answer.  See <a href="Yes_002dor_002dNo-Queries.html#Yes_002dor_002dNo-Queries">Yes-or-No Queries</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>cancel-timer</b><var> timer<a name="index-cancel_002dtimer-3787"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This cancels the requested action for <var>timer</var>, which should be a
timer&mdash;usually, one previously returned by <code>run-at-time</code> or
<code>run-with-idle-timer</code>.  This cancels the effect of that call to
one of these functions; the arrival of the specified time will not
cause anything special to happen. 
</p></blockquote></div>
