  The following schematic shows the structure of a live window:

   <p><a name="index-window-body-2417"></a><a name="index-text-area-of-a-window-2418"></a><a name="index-body-of-a-window-2419"></a>  At the center of the window is the <dfn>text area</dfn>, or <dfn>body</dfn>,
where the buffer text is displayed.  The text area can be surrounded by
a series of optional areas.  On the left and right, from innermost to
outermost, these are the left and right fringes, denoted by LF and RF
(see <a href="Fringes.html#Fringes">Fringes</a>); the left and right margins, denoted by LM and RM in
the schematic (see <a href="Display-Margins.html#Display-Margins">Display Margins</a>); the left or right vertical
scroll bar, only one of which is present at any time, denoted by LS and
RS (see <a href="Scroll-Bars.html#Scroll-Bars">Scroll Bars</a>); and the right divider, denoted by RD
(see <a href="Window-Dividers.html#Window-Dividers">Window Dividers</a>).  At the top of the window is the header line
(see <a href="Header-Lines.html#Header-Lines">Header Lines</a>).  At the bottom of the window are the horizontal
scroll bar (see <a href="Scroll-Bars.html#Scroll-Bars">Scroll Bars</a>); the mode line (see <a href="Mode-Line-Format.html#Mode-Line-Format">Mode Line Format</a>); and the bottom divider (see <a href="Window-Dividers.html#Window-Dividers">Window Dividers</a>).

   <p>Emacs provides miscellaneous functions for finding the height and
width of a window.  The return value of many of these functions can be
specified either in units of pixels or in units of lines and columns. 
On a graphical display, the latter actually correspond to the height and
width of a default character specified by the frame's default font
as returned by <code>frame-char-height</code> and <code>frame-char-width</code>
(see <a href="Frame-Font.html#Frame-Font">Frame Font</a>).  Thus, if a window is displaying text with a
different font or size, the reported line height and column width for
that window may differ from the actual number of text lines or columns
displayed within it.

   <p><a name="index-window-height-2420"></a><a name="index-height-of-a-window-2421"></a><a name="index-total-height-of-a-window-2422"></a>  The <dfn>total height</dfn> of a window is the number of lines comprising
the window's body, the header line, the horizontal scroll bar, the mode
line and the bottom divider (if any).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-total-height</b><var> &amp;optional window round<a name="index-window_002dtotal_002dheight-2423"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the total height, in lines, of the window
<var>window</var>.  If <var>window</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it defaults to
the selected window.  If <var>window</var> is an internal window, the return
value is the total height occupied by its descendant windows.

        <p>If a window's pixel height is not an integral multiple of its frame's
default character height, the number of lines occupied by the window is
rounded internally.  This is done in a way such that, if the window is a
parent window, the sum of the total heights of all its child windows
internally equals the total height of their parent.  This means that
although two windows have the same pixel height, their internal total
heights may differ by one line.  This means also, that if window is
vertically combined and has a next sibling, the topmost row of that
sibling can be calculated as the sum of this window's topmost row and
total height (see <a href="Coordinates-and-Windows.html#Coordinates-and-Windows">Coordinates and Windows</a>)

        <p>If the optional argument <var>round</var> is <code>ceiling</code>, this
function returns the smallest integer larger than <var>window</var>'s pixel
height divided by the character height of its frame; if it is
<code>floor</code>, it returns the largest integer smaller than said value;
with any other <var>round</var> it returns the internal value of
<var>windows</var>'s total height. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-window-width-2424"></a><a name="index-width-of-a-window-2425"></a><a name="index-total-width-of-a-window-2426"></a>The <dfn>total width</dfn> of a window is the number of lines comprising the
window's body, its margins, fringes, scroll bars and a right divider (if
any).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-total-width</b><var> &amp;optional window round<a name="index-window_002dtotal_002dwidth-2427"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the total width, in columns, of the window
<var>window</var>.  If <var>window</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it defaults to
the selected window.  If <var>window</var> is internal, the return value is
the total width occupied by its descendant windows.

        <p>If a window's pixel width is not an integral multiple of its frame's
character width, the number of lines occupied by the window is rounded
internally.  This is done in a way such that, if the window is a parent
window, the sum of the total widths of all its children internally
equals the total width of their parent.  This means that although two
windows have the same pixel width, their internal total widths may
differ by one column.  This means also, that if this window is
horizontally combined and has a next sibling, the leftmost column of
that sibling can be calculated as the sum of this window's leftmost
column and total width (see <a href="Coordinates-and-Windows.html#Coordinates-and-Windows">Coordinates and Windows</a>).  The optional
argument <var>round</var> behaves as it does for <code>window-total-height</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-total-size</b><var> &amp;optional window horizontal round<a name="index-window_002dtotal_002dsize-2428"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns either the total height in lines or the total
width in columns of the window <var>window</var>.  If <var>horizontal</var> is
omitted or <code>nil</code>, this is equivalent to calling
<code>window-total-height</code> for <var>window</var>; otherwise it is equivalent
to calling <code>window-total-width</code> for <var>window</var>.  The optional
argument <var>round</var> behaves as it does for <code>window-total-height</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The following two functions can be used to return the total size of a
window in units of pixels.

<var>window</var> must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.

        <p>The return value includes mode and header line, a horizontal scroll bar

   <p><a name="index-full_002dwidth-window-2437"></a><a name="index-full_002dheight-window-2438"></a>  The following functions can be used to determine whether a given
window has any adjacent windows.

<div class="defun">

above or below it in its frame.  More precisely, this means that the
total height of <var>window</var> equals the total height of the root window

<var>window</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it defaults to the selected
window.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-full-width-p</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dfull_002dwidth_002dp-2440"></a></var><br>

that of the root window on that frame.  If <var>window</var> is omitted or
<code>nil</code>, it defaults to the selected window.

   <p><a name="index-window-body-height-2441"></a><a name="index-body-height-of-a-window-2442"></a><a name="index-window-body-width-2443"></a>The <dfn>body height</dfn> of a window is the height of its text area, which
does not include a mode or header line, a horizontal scroll bar, or a
bottom divider.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-body-height</b><var> &amp;optional window pixelwise<a name="index-window_002dbody_002dheight-2444"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the height, in lines, of the body of window
<var>window</var>.  If <var>window</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it defaults to
the selected window; otherwise it must be a live window.

        <p>If the optional argument <var>pixelwise</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this
function returns the body height of <var>window</var> counted in pixels.

        <p>If <var>pixelwise</var> is <code>nil</code>, the return value is rounded down to
the nearest integer, if necessary.  This means that if a line at the
bottom of the text area is only partially visible, that line is not
counted.  It also means that the height of a window's body can never
exceed its total height as returned by <code>window-total-height</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-body-width-of-a-window-2445"></a><a name="index-body-size-of-a-window-2446"></a><a name="index-window-body-size-2447"></a>The <dfn>body width</dfn> of a window is the width of its text area, which

        <p>If <var>pixelwise</var> is <code>nil</code>, the return value is rounded down to
the nearest integer, if necessary.  This means that if a column on the
right of the text area is only partially visible, that column is not
counted.  It also means that the width of a window's body can never

</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-body-size</b><var> &amp;optional window horizontal pixelwise<a name="index-window_002dbody_002dsize-2449"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the body height or body width of <var>window</var>.  If
<var>horizontal</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it is equivalent to calling
<code>window-body-height</code> for <var>window</var>; otherwise it is equivalent
to calling <code>window-body-width</code>.  In either case, the optional
argument <var>pixelwise</var> is passed to the function called. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>For compatibility with previous versions of Emacs,
<code>window-height</code> is an alias for <code>window-total-height</code>, and
<code>window-width</code> is an alias for <code>window-body-width</code>.  These
aliases are considered obsolete and will be removed in the future.

   <p>The pixel heights of a window's mode and header line can be retrieved
with the functions given below.  Their return value is usually accurate
unless the window has not been displayed before: In that case, the
return value is based on an estimate of the font used for the window's
frame.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-mode-line-height</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dmode_002dline_002dheight-2450"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the height in pixels of <var>window</var>'s mode line. 
<var>window</var> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.  If
<var>window</var> has no mode line, the return value is zero. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-header-line-height</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dheader_002dline_002dheight-2451"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the height in pixels of <var>window</var>'s header
line.  <var>window</var> must be a live window and defaults to the selected
one.  If <var>window</var> has no header line, the return value is zero. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Functions for retrieving the height and/or width of window dividers
(see <a href="Window-Dividers.html#Window-Dividers">Window Dividers</a>), fringes (see <a href="Fringes.html#Fringes">Fringes</a>), scroll bars
(see <a href="Scroll-Bars.html#Scroll-Bars">Scroll Bars</a>), and display margins (see <a href="Display-Margins.html#Display-Margins">Display Margins</a>) are
described in the corresponding sections.

   <p><a name="index-fixed_002dsize-window-2452"></a><a name="index-window_002dmin_002dheight-2453"></a><a name="index-window_002dmin_002dwidth-2454"></a>  Commands that change the size of windows (see <a href="Resizing-Windows.html#Resizing-Windows">Resizing Windows</a>),
or split them (see <a href="Splitting-Windows.html#Splitting-Windows">Splitting Windows</a>), obey the variables
<code>window-min-height</code> and <code>window-min-width</code>, which specify the
smallest allowable window height and width.  They also obey the variable
<code>window-size-fixed</code>, with which a window can be <dfn>fixed</dfn> in
size:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>window-min-height</b><var><a name="index-window_002dmin_002dheight-2455"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This option specifies the minimum total height, in lines, of any window. 
Its value has to accommodate at least one text line as well as a mode
and header line, a horizontal scroll bar and a bottom divider, if
present. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>window-min-width</b><var><a name="index-window_002dmin_002dwidth-2456"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This option specifies the minimum total width, in columns, of any
window.  Its value has to accommodate two text columns as well as
margins, fringes, a scroll bar and a right divider, if present. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The following function tells how small a specific window can get taking
into account the sizes of its areas and the values of
<code>window-min-height</code>, <code>window-min-width</code> and
<code>window-size-fixed</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-min-size</b><var> &amp;optional window horizontal ignore pixelwise<a name="index-window_002dmin_002dsize-2457"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the minimum size of <var>window</var>.  <var>window</var>
must be a valid window and defaults to the selected one.  The optional
argument <var>horizontal</var> non-<code>nil</code> means to return the minimum
number of columns of <var>window</var>; otherwise return the minimum number
of <var>window</var>'s lines.

        <p>The return value makes sure that all components of <var>window</var> remain
fully visible if <var>window</var>'s size were actually set to it.  With
<var>horizontal</var> <code>nil</code> it includes the mode and header line, the
horizontal scroll bar and the bottom divider.  With <var>horizontal</var>
non-<code>nil</code> it includes the fringes, a scroll bar, and a right
divider, if present.  It does not, however, include the space reserved
for the margins.

        <p>The optional argument <var>ignore</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means ignore
restrictions imposed by fixed size windows, <code>window-min-height</code> or
<code>window-min-width</code> settings.  If <var>ignore</var> equals <code>safe</code>,
live windows may get as small as <code>window-safe-min-height</code> lines and
<code>window-safe-min-width</code> columns.  If <var>ignore</var> is a window,
ignore restrictions for that window only.  Any other non-<code>nil</code>
value means ignore all of the above restrictions for all windows.

        <p>The optional argument <var>pixelwise</var> non-<code>nil</code> means to return the
minimum size of <var>window</var> counted in pixels. 
</p></blockquote></div>
