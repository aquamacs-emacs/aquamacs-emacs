<h3 class="section">28.15 The Size of a Window</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-size-2158"></a><a name="index-size-of-window-2159"></a>
  An Emacs window is rectangular, and its size information consists of
the height (the number of lines) and the width (the number of character
positions in each line).  The mode line is included in the height.  But
the width does not count the scroll bar or the column of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;
characters that separates side-by-side windows.

   <p>The following three functions return size information about a window:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-height</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dheight-2160"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the number of lines in <var>window</var> (by default
the selected window), including any mode line and header line. 
The result is almost always less than the value of <code>frame-height</code>
for the associated frame, because the latter also includes any echo
area.  Depending on the toolkit in use, the frame height can also
include the menu bar and tool bar (see <a href="Size-and-Position.html#Size-and-Position">Size and Position</a>). 
Therefore in general it is not straightforward to compare window and
frame heights (see <code>window-full-height-p</code> below).

     <pre class="example">          (window-height)
               &rArr; 23
          (split-window-vertically)
               &rArr; #&lt;window 4 on windows.texi&gt;
          (window-height)
               &rArr; 11
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-body-height</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dbody_002dheight-2161"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Like <code>window-height</code> but the value does not include the
mode line (if any) or the header line (if any). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-full-height-p</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dfull_002dheight_002dp-2162"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns non-<code>nil</code> if <var>window</var> is as tall as the
frame that contains it.  The default for <var>window</var> is the selected
window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-width</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dwidth-2163"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the number of columns in <var>window</var>.  The
default for <var>window</var> is the selected window.

        <p>The return value does not include the window's scroll bar or the column
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo; characters that separates side-by-side windows.  Moreover,
the return value does not include the space used for displaying fringes
and margins.  Hence you cannot, in general, compare the return values of
<code>window-width</code> and <code>frame-width</code> for equality to determine
whether a window is a wide as the containing frame.  Use the function
<code>window-full-width-p</code>, see below, instead.

     <pre class="example">          (window-width)
               &rArr; 80
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-full-width-p</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dfull_002dwidth_002dp-2164"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns non-<code>nil</code> if <var>window</var> is as wide as the
frame that contains it; otherwise <code>nil</code>.  The default for
<var>window</var> is the selected window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-edges</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dedges-2165"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a list of the edge coordinates of <var>window</var>. 
The default for <var>window</var> is the selected window.

        <p>The order of the list is <code>(</code><var>left</var> <var>top</var> <var>right</var>
<var>bottom</var><code>)</code>, all elements relative to 0, 0 at the top left corner of
the frame.  The element <var>right</var> of the value is one more than the
rightmost column used by <var>window</var>, and <var>bottom</var> is one more than
the bottommost row used by <var>window</var> and its mode-line.

        <p>The edges include the space used by the window's scroll bar, display
margins, fringes, header line, and mode line, if it has them.  Also,
if the window has a neighbor on the right, its right edge value
includes the width of the separator line between the window and that
neighbor.  Since the width of the window does not include this
separator, the width does not usually equal the difference between the
right and left edges. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-inside-edges</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dinside_002dedges-2166"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is similar to <code>window-edges</code>, but the edge values
it returns include only the text area of the window.  They
do not include the header line, mode line, scroll bar or
vertical separator, fringes, or display margins. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Here are the results obtained on a typical 24-line terminal with just
one window, with menu bar enabled:

<pre class="example">     (window-edges (selected-window))
          &rArr; (0 1 80 23)
     (window-inside-edges (selected-window))
          &rArr; (0 1 80 22)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The bottom edge is at line 23 because the last line is the echo area. 
The bottom inside edge is at line 22, which is the window's mode line.

   <p>If <var>window</var> is at the upper left corner of its frame, and there is
no menu bar, then <var>bottom</var> returned by <code>window-edges</code> is the
same as the value of <code>(window-height)</code>, <var>right</var> is almost the
same as the value of <code>(window-width)</code>, and <var>top</var> and
<var>left</var> are zero.  For example, the edges of the following window
are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0&nbsp;0&nbsp;8&nbsp;5</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  Assuming that the frame has more than 8
columns, the last column of the window (column 7) holds a border
rather than text.  The last row (row 4) holds the mode line, shown
here with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xxxxxxxxx</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<pre class="example">                0
                _______
             0 |       |
               |       |
               |       |
               |       |
               xxxxxxxxx  4
     
                       7
</pre>
   <p>In the following example, let's suppose that the frame is 7
columns wide.  Then the edges of the left window are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0&nbsp;0&nbsp;4&nbsp;3</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
and the edges of the right window are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4&nbsp;0&nbsp;7&nbsp;3</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->. 
The inside edges of the left window are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0&nbsp;0&nbsp;3&nbsp;2</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->,
and the inside edges of the right window are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4&nbsp;0&nbsp;7&nbsp;2</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->,

<pre class="example">                ___ ___
               |   |   |
               |   |   |
               xxxxxxxxx
     
                0  34  7
</pre>
   <div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-pixel-edges</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dpixel_002dedges-2167"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is like <code>window-edges</code> except that, on a graphical
display, the edge values are measured in pixels instead of in
character lines and columns. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-inside-pixel-edges</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dinside_002dpixel_002dedges-2168"></a></var><br>
