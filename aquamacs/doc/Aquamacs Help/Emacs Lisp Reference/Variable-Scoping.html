<h3 class="section">11.9 Scoping Rules for Variable Bindings</h3>

<p>A given symbol <code>foo</code> can have several local variable bindings,
established at different places in the Lisp program, as well as a global
binding.  The most recently established binding takes precedence over
the others.

   <p><a name="index-scope-611"></a><a name="index-extent-612"></a><a name="index-dynamic-scoping-613"></a><a name="index-lexical-scoping-614"></a>  Local bindings in Emacs Lisp have <dfn>indefinite scope</dfn> and
<dfn>dynamic extent</dfn>.  <dfn>Scope</dfn> refers to <em>where</em> textually in
the source code the binding can be accessed.  &ldquo;Indefinite scope&rdquo; means
that any part of the program can potentially access the variable
binding.  <dfn>Extent</dfn> refers to <em>when</em>, as the program is
executing, the binding exists.  &ldquo;Dynamic extent&rdquo; means that the binding
lasts as long as the activation of the construct that established it.

   <p>The combination of dynamic extent and indefinite scope is called
<dfn>dynamic scoping</dfn>.  By contrast, most programming languages use
<dfn>lexical scoping</dfn>, in which references to a local variable must be
located textually within the function or block that binds the variable.

   <p><a name="index-CL-note_002d_002d_002dspecial-variables-615"></a><blockquote>
<b>Common Lisp note:</b> Variables declared &ldquo;special&rdquo; in Common Lisp are
dynamically scoped, like all variables in Emacs Lisp.
