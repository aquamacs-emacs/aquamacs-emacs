<h3 class="section">34.7 Search and Replace</h3>

<p><a name="index-replacement-after-search-3034"></a><a name="index-searching-and-replacing-3035"></a>
  If you want to find all matches for a regexp in part of the buffer,
and replace them, the best way is to write an explicit loop using
<code>re-search-forward</code> and <code>replace-match</code>, like this:

<pre class="example">     (while (re-search-forward "foo[ \t]+bar" nil t)
       (replace-match "foobar"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">See <a href="Replacing-Match.html#Replacing-Match">Replacing the Text that Matched</a>, for a
description of <code>replace-match</code>.

   <p>However, replacing matches in a string is more complex, especially
if you want to do it efficiently.  So Emacs provides a function to do
this.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>replace-regexp-in-string</b><var> regexp rep string &amp;optional fixedcase literal subexp start<a name="index-replace_002dregexp_002din_002dstring-3036"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function copies <var>string</var> and searches it for matches for
<var>regexp</var>, and replaces them with <var>rep</var>.  It returns the
modified copy.  If <var>start</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the search for
matches starts at that index in <var>string</var>, so matches starting
before that index are not changed.

        <p>This function uses <code>replace-match</code> to do the replacement, and it
passes the optional arguments <var>fixedcase</var>, <var>literal</var> and
<var>subexp</var> along to <code>replace-match</code>.

        <p>Instead of a string, <var>rep</var> can be a function.  In that case,
<code>replace-regexp-in-string</code> calls <var>rep</var> for each match,
passing the text of the match as its sole argument.  It collects the
value <var>rep</var> returns and passes that to <code>replace-match</code> as the
replacement string.  The match-data at this point are the result
of matching <var>regexp</var> against a substring of <var>string</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If you want to write a command along the lines of <code>query-replace</code>,
you can use <code>perform-replace</code> to do the work.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>perform-replace</b><var> from-string replacements query-flag regexp-flag delimited-flag &amp;optional repeat-count map start end<a name="index-perform_002dreplace-3037"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is the guts of <code>query-replace</code> and related
commands.  It searches for occurrences of <var>from-string</var> in the
text between positions <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> and replaces some or
all of them.  If <var>start</var> is <code>nil</code> (or omitted), point is used
instead, and the end of the buffer's accessible portion is used for
<var>end</var>.

        <p>If <var>query-flag</var> is <code>nil</code>, it replaces all
occurrences; otherwise, it asks the user what to do about each one.

        <p>If <var>regexp-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <var>from-string</var> is
considered a regular expression; otherwise, it must match literally.  If
<var>delimited-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then only replacements
surrounded by word boundaries are considered.

        <p>The argument <var>replacements</var> specifies what to replace occurrences
with.  If it is a string, that string is used.  It can also be a list of
strings, to be used in cyclic order.

        <p>If <var>replacements</var> is a cons cell, <code>(</code><var>function</var><code>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</code><var>data</var><code>)</code><!-- /@w -->, this means to call <var>function</var> after each match to
get the replacement text.  This function is called with two arguments:
<var>data</var>, and the number of replacements already made.

        <p>If <var>repeat-count</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it should be an integer.  Then
it specifies how many times to use each of the strings in the
<var>replacements</var> list before advancing cyclically to the next one.

        <p>If <var>from-string</var> contains upper-case letters, then
<code>perform-replace</code> binds <code>case-fold-search</code> to <code>nil</code>, and
it uses the <code>replacements</code> without altering the case of them.

        <p>Normally, the keymap <code>query-replace-map</code> defines the possible
user responses for queries.  The argument <var>map</var>, if
non-<code>nil</code>, specifies a keymap to use instead of
<code>query-replace-map</code>.

        <p>This function uses one of two functions to search for the next
occurrence of <var>from-string</var>.  These functions are specified by the
values of two variables: <code>replace-re-search-function</code> and
<code>replace-search-function</code>.  The former is called when the
argument <var>regexp-flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the latter when it is
<code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>query-replace-map</b><var><a name="index-query_002dreplace_002dmap-3038"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds a special keymap that defines the valid user
responses for <code>perform-replace</code> and the commands that use it, as
well as <code>y-or-n-p</code> and <code>map-y-or-n-p</code>.  This map is unusual
in two ways:

          <ul>
<li>The &ldquo;key bindings&rdquo; are not commands, just symbols that are meaningful
to the functions that use this map.

          <li>Prefix keys are not supported; each key binding must be for a
single-event key sequence.  This is because the functions don't use
<code>read-key-sequence</code> to get the input; instead, they read a single
event and look it up &ldquo;by hand.&rdquo;
</ul>
        </p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Here are the meaningful &ldquo;bindings&rdquo; for <code>query-replace-map</code>. 
Several of them are meaningful only for <code>query-replace</code> and
friends.

     <dl>
<dt><code>act</code><dd>Do take the action being considered&mdash;in other words, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;

     <br><dt><code>skip</code><dd>Do not take action for this question&mdash;in other words, &ldquo;no.&rdquo;

     <br><dt><code>exit</code><dd>Answer this question &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and give up on the entire series of
questions, assuming that the answers will be &ldquo;no.&rdquo;

     <br><dt><code>act-and-exit</code><dd>Answer this question &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and give up on the entire series of
questions, assuming that subsequent answers will be &ldquo;no.&rdquo;

     <br><dt><code>act-and-show</code><dd>Answer this question &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; but show the results&mdash;don't advance yet
to the next question.

     <br><dt><code>automatic</code><dd>Answer this question and all subsequent questions in the series with
&ldquo;yes,&rdquo; without further user interaction.

     <br><dt><code>backup</code><dd>Move back to the previous place that a question was asked about.

     <br><dt><code>edit</code><dd>Enter a recursive edit to deal with this question&mdash;instead of any
other action that would normally be taken.

     <br><dt><code>delete-and-edit</code><dd>Delete the text being considered, then enter a recursive edit to replace
it.

     <br><dt><code>recenter</code><dd>Redisplay and center the window, then ask the same question again.

     <br><dt><code>quit</code><dd>Perform a quit right away.  Only <code>y-or-n-p</code> and related functions
use this answer.

     <br><dt><code>help</code><dd>Display some help, then ask again.
