<h3 class="section">13.2 Expansion of a Macro Call</h3>

<p><a name="index-expansion-of-macros-734"></a><a name="index-macro-call-735"></a>
  A macro call looks just like a function call in that it is a list which
starts with the name of the macro.  The rest of the elements of the list
are the arguments of the macro.

   <p>Evaluation of the macro call begins like evaluation of a function call
except for one crucial difference: the macro arguments are the actual
expressions appearing in the macro call.  They are not evaluated before
they are given to the macro definition.  By contrast, the arguments of a
function are results of evaluating the elements of the function call
list.

   <p>Having obtained the arguments, Lisp invokes the macro definition just
as a function is invoked.  The argument variables of the macro are bound
to the argument values from the macro call, or to a list of them in the
case of a <code>&amp;rest</code> argument.  And the macro body executes and
returns its value just as a function body does.

   <p>The second crucial difference between macros and functions is that the
value returned by the macro body is not the value of the macro call. 
Instead, it is an alternate expression for computing that value, also
known as the <dfn>expansion</dfn> of the macro.  The Lisp interpreter
proceeds to evaluate the expansion as soon as it comes back from the
macro.

   <p>Since the expansion is evaluated in the normal manner, it may contain
calls to other macros.  It may even be a call to the same macro, though
this is unusual.

   <p>You can see the expansion of a given macro call by calling
<code>macroexpand</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>macroexpand</b><var> form &amp;optional environment<a name="index-macroexpand-736"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-macro-expansion-737"></a>This function expands <var>form</var>, if it is a macro call.  If the result
is another macro call, it is expanded in turn, until something which is
not a macro call results.  That is the value returned by
<code>macroexpand</code>.  If <var>form</var> is not a macro call to begin with, it
is returned as given.

        <p>Note that <code>macroexpand</code> does not look at the subexpressions of
<var>form</var> (although some macro definitions may do so).  Even if they
are macro calls themselves, <code>macroexpand</code> does not expand them.

        <p>The function <code>macroexpand</code> does not expand calls to inline functions. 
Normally there is no need for that, since a call to an inline function is
no harder to understand than a call to an ordinary function.

        <p>If <var>environment</var> is provided, it specifies an alist of macro
definitions that shadow the currently defined macros.  Byte compilation
uses this feature.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (defmacro inc (var)
              (list 'setq var (list '1+ var)))
               &rArr; inc
          
          (macroexpand '(inc r))
               &rArr; (setq r (1+ r))
          
          (defmacro inc2 (var1 var2)
              (list 'progn (list 'inc var1) (list 'inc var2)))
               &rArr; inc2
          
          (macroexpand '(inc2 r s))
               &rArr; (progn (inc r) (inc s))  ; <code>inc</code><span class="roman"> not expanded here.</span>
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>macroexpand-all</b><var> form &amp;optional environment<a name="index-macroexpand_002dall-738"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><code>macroexpand-all</code> expands macros like <code>macroexpand</code>, but
will look for and expand all macros in <var>form</var>, not just at the
top-level.  If no macros are expanded, the return value is <code>eq</code>
to <var>form</var>.

        <p>Repeating the example used for <code>macroexpand</code> above with
<code>macroexpand-all</code>, we see that <code>macroexpand-all</code> <em>does</em>
expand the embedded calls to <code>inc</code>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (macroexpand-all '(inc2 r s))
               &rArr; (progn (setq r (1+ r)) (setq s (1+ s)))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
