<LI>SUMMARY: More bugs and other annoyances
        have been removed. Opening new frames (for new buffers) is more
        useful now, and frame themes aren't applied when a frame is split
        up. Options are automatically saved across sessions. A new
        customization groups for Emacs-die-hards makes it easier to change
        Aquamacs-specific customization defaults.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Intel: Aquamacs is now available as native version for Mac
        computers with Intel CPU.  Thanks to Jonathan Shea, Mike Bennett
        and Richard Koch for providing compile machines.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Dired in one-buffer-one-frame-mode will show new
        directories and open files in the same frame.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Customize will show new groups etc. in the same frame and window.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>One-Buffer-One-Frame-Mode ("Display Buffers in Separate Frames")
        will now show buffers such as *mail*, *grep*, *shell* in their own
        frames. This also applies if other modes open *...* buffers, such
        as ESS opening an inferior R shell, which previously didn't even
        show in a separate window. One-Buffer-One-Frame-Mode is also better
        documented now and has customization options so you can decide
        which buffers are shown in new frames.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Frame-Appearance-Themes reconfigure a frame only if just one
        window is present (or all windows show buffers in the same major
        mode). This should more effectively prevent appearance switching
        when a second window is shown temporarily.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Frame-Appearance-Themes now allow the user to delete all
        mode-specific themes when a default is defined. Hints to select
        "Save Options" are more prominent.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Options are saved automatically upon quitting Aquamacs (it'll
        ask you.) - customize `aquamacs-save-options-on-quit' to
        configure.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Quitting Aquamacs: you won't be asked any more whether to quit
        if modified buffers exist, because at that point you've always already
        been asked to save each modified buffer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs-is-more-than-Emacs is a new customization group
        containing all customization variables whose defaults are changed
        in Aquamacs compared to GNU Emacs or the relevant package.
        This is useful for Emacs veterans who want certain behaviors to be
        more similar to GNU Emacs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bug Reporting is handled fully in the system's default mail
        client again (unless you've set up a different
        `send-mail-function')
        Suggested by Robert Sloan

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Mail composed with the Message package will now be routed
        through the mail client by default (`message-send-mail-function')
        and there is no "From" line. If you run postfix locally, you may
        want to do something like the following in your .emacs or Preferences.el:

<P>
<PRE>
        (setq send-mail-function 'sendmail-send-it)
        (setq message-send-mail-function 'sendmail-send-it)
        (setq mail-setup-with-from t)
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively do the same in customization buffers.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Toolbar looks prettier now.
        Patch by Kim F. Storm

<P>
</LI>
<LI>`Frame-Appearance-Styles' is the new name for the former `Frame
        Appearance Themes, so they won't be confused with GNU Emacs new
        customization themes. A global minor mode called
        `aquamacs-styles-mode' is now used to switch them on/off.

<P>
Some configuration variables have been renamed:
        `aquamacs-default-styles'
               (was: `aquamacs-mode-specific-default-themes')
        `aquamacs-styles-mode'
               (was: `aquamacs-auto-frame-parameters-flag')
        `aquamacs-buffer-default-styles'
               (was: `aquamacs-buffer-specific-frame-themes')

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A-Backspace deletes the whole logical line again, not just
        the visual line. A-Shift-Backspace deletes the visual line now.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tilde ~ can now be input on German keyboards with the German
        emulation mode via Option-N.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Frame-positions for individual files are now saved to/loaded
        from a file called frame-positions.el (in&nbsp;/Library/Preferences...)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Help buffers (C-h f, C-h v) for certain Aquamacs functions could
        have links to source code at nonexistant paths.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>site-start.el files in the load path (plug-ins!) aren't loaded
        any longer if there is a file named .ignore in the same path.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix in version 0.9.9: customizations weren't read if
        aquamacs-styles (the former "Frame Appearance Themes" were
        switched off.)
        Reported by Brendan Dixon

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Typing C-x C-f, then A-w made the newly opened frame go
        away, but not the "Find file" prompt, which was quite persistent,
        especially if you didn't know about C-g and the minibuffer. That
        is fixed now.
        Reported by a number of people.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Setting tool-bar-mode or changing the fringes via the
        Options menu will now affect the default frame style as well, so
        the setting will affect new frames (even if frame appearance
        styles are active). Note that if fringes or tool bar are set in
        .emacs, the customized and saved styles will override your
        settings.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Aquamacs will not ask the user any longer whether to
        save dired buffers and other non-file-buffers upon deleting the
        frame (killing the buffer).
        Reported by Carsten Bormann

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: desktop-mode should be able to restore the desktop on
        startup appropriately.
        Reported by Rudi Schlatte

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: page-wise scrolling (PgUp/PgDown) with long lines
        scrolls exactly one screen now

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: page-wise scrolling (PgUp/PgDown) will remove the region
        as expected when the cursor moves. Shift-PgUp/PgDown will extend
        the region (and set the mark if neccessary).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: completing-read-multiple didn't work (icomplete+ library
        updated)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: frames sometimes didn't open in
        one-buffer-one-frame-mode when the buffer shown was empty.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: In one-buffer-one-frame-mode, Apple-W deletes a window
        or kills a buffer and returns to the next buffer in the buffer
        list (i.e. the previously shown buffer) when the frame wasn't
        created for the particular window / buffer being killed. Think of
        it as a stack of buffers that are shown. Previously, Aquamacs
        always switched to *scratch*.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Preview &amp; Print now works with buffers in Tramp Mode, too.
        Reported by Tim Hodgson

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Fonts (not fontsets) set in default-frame-alist and
        similar variables are not filtered out any more after startup if
        they haven't been explicitly loaded (or applied to a frame, and
        thus, loaded).
        Reported by Konstantinos Efstathiou

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: display copyright message at startup.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Javascript-mode exchanged for the one borrowed from
        XEmacs. This one will hopefully work better now.
        Suggested by Tom Van Vleck

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: ediff-directories interferes less with one-buffer-one-frame-mode.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Compiling: Those who build Aquamacs themselves, note that the
        make-aquamacs script will now produce a complete app bundle
        located in (emacs-path)/mac/Aquamacs. The install-aquamacs script
        only moves the bundle to /Applications. If you make any changes to
        the Aquamacs source code (except for pre-loaded code in
        site-load.el), it is usually sufficient to run
        "copy-to-app -n". Remember to set the AQUAMACS_ROOT and EMACS_ROOT
        environment variables before using any of these scripts.

<P>
</LI>

        also like to thank all those who tested the beta versions,
        reported bugs and contributed ideas and server space:
