<dt><kbd>d </kbd><var>motion-command</var><dd><a name="index-g_t1440-_0040kbd_007bd_007d-_0028_0040code_007bvip_002dcommand_002dargument_007d_0029-197"></a>Delete the region determined by the motion command <var>motion-command</var>. 
</dl>
For example, <kbd>d $</kbd> will delete the region between point and end of
current line since <kbd>$</kbd> is a point command that moves point to end of line. 
<kbd>d G</kbd> will delete the region between the beginning of current line and
end of the buffer, since <kbd>G</kbd> is a line command.  A count given to the
command above will become the count for the associated motion command. 
Thus, <kbd>3 d w</kbd> will delete three words.

   <p><a name="index-g_t042-_0040kbd_007b_0022_007d-_0028_0040code_007bvip_002dcommand_002dargument_007d_0029-198"></a>It is also possible to save the deleted text into a register you specify. 
For example, you can say <kbd>" t 3 d w</kbd> to delete three words and save it
to register <kbd>t</kbd>.  The name of a register is a lower-case letter between
<kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>z</kbd>.  If you give an upper-case letter as an argument to
a delete command, then the deleted text will be appended to the content of
the register having the corresponding lower-case letter as its name.  So,
<kbd>" T d w</kbd> will delete a word and append it to register <kbd>t</kbd>.  Other
modifying commands also accept a register name as their argument, and we
will not repeat similar explanations.

   <p>We have more delete commands as below.
