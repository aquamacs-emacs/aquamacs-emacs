<h2 class="chapter">5 How Does this EDT Emulation Differ from Real EDT?</h2>

<p>In general, you will find that this emulation of EDT replicates most,
but not all, of EDT's most used Keypad Mode editing functions and
behavior.  It is not perfect, but most EDT users who have tried the
emulation agree that it is quite good enough to make it easy for
die-hard EDT users to move over to using GNU Emacs.

   <p>Here's a list of the most important differences between EDT and this GNU
Emacs EDT Emulation.  The list is short but you must be aware of these
differences if you are to use the EDT Emulation effectively.

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Entering repeat counts works a little differently than in EDT.

     <p>EDT allows users to enter a repeat count before entering a command that
accepts repeat counts.  For example, when using the real EDT, pressing
these three keys in sequence, <kbd>GOLD 5 KP1</kbd>, will move the cursor in
the current direction 5 words.  This does <strong>not</strong> work in Emacs!

     <p>Emacs provides two ways to enter repeat counts and neither involves
using the &lt;GOLD&gt; key.  First, repeat counts can be entered in Emacs
by using the &lt;ESC&gt; key.  For example, pressing these keys in
sequence, <kbd>ESC 1 0 KP1</kbd>, will move the cursor in the current
direction 10 words.  Second, Emacs provides another command called
<code>universal-argument</code> that can be used to do the same thing. 
Normally, in Emacs has this bound to <kbd>C-u</kbd>.

     <li>EDT's line mode commands and nokeypad mode commands are <strong>not</strong>
supported (with one important exception; see item 8 in
<a href="Highlights.html#Highlights">Highlights</a>).  Although, at first, this may seem like a big
omission, the set of built-in Emacs commands provides a much richer set
of capabilities which more than make up for this omission.

     <p>To enter Emacs commands not bound to keys, you can press <kbd>GOLD KP7</kbd>
or the &lt;DO&gt; key.  Emacs will display its own command prompt "M-x". 
This stands for the keypress <kbd>Meta-x</kbd>, where &lt;Meta&gt; is a special
shift key.  The &lt;Alt&gt; key is often mapped to behave as a &lt;Meta&gt;
key.  So, you can also invoke this prompt by pressing <kbd>Meta-x</kbd>. 
Typing the sequence <kbd>ESC x</kbd> will also invoke the prompt.

     <li>Selected text is highlighted <strong>only</strong> on systems where Emacs
supports the highlighting of text.

     <li>Just like in TPU/EVE, the &lt;ENTER&gt; key is <strong>not</strong> used to
terminate input when the editor prompts you for input.  The &lt;RETURN&gt;
key is used, instead.  (&lt;KP4&gt; and &lt;KP5&gt; (the direction keys) do
terminate input for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FIND</span></samp>&rsquo; command, just like in EDT, however.)

        </ol>
