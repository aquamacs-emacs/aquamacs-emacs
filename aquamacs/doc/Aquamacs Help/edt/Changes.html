<h3 class="section">1.2 What's New in Version 4.0</h3>

<p>Version 4.0 contains the following enhancements:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Scroll margins at the top and bottom of the window are now supported. 
(The design was copied from <samp><span class="file">tpu-extras.el</span></samp>.)  By default, this
feature is enabled with the top margin set to 10% of the window and the
bottom margin set to 15% of the window.  To change these settings, you
can invoke the function <code>edt-set-scroll-margins</code> in your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  For example, the following line

     <pre class="example">          (edt-set-scroll-margins "20%" "25%")
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">sets the top margin to 20% of the window and the bottom margin
to 25% of the window.  To disable this feature, set each margin to 0%. 
You can also invoke <code>edt-set-scroll-margins</code> interactively while
EDT Emulation is active to change the settings for that session.

     <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Another way to set the scroll margins is to use
the Emacs customization feature (not available in Emacs 19) to set the
following two variables directly: <code>edt-top-scroll-margin</code> and
<code>edt-bottom-scroll-margin</code>.

     <p>Enter the Emacs <code>customize</code> command.  First select the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Editing</span></samp>&rsquo; group and then select the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Emulations</span></samp>&rsquo; group. 
Finally, select the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edt</span></samp>&rsquo; group and follow the directions.

     <li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SUBS</span></samp>&rsquo; command is now supported and bound to <kbd>GOLD-Enter</kbd>
by default.  (This design was copied from <samp><span class="file">tpu-edt.el</span></samp>.)  Note, in
earlier versions of EDT Emulation, <kbd>GOLD-Enter</kbd> was assigned to the
Emacs function <code>query-replace</code>.  The binding of
<code>query-replace</code> has been moved to <kbd>GOLD-/</kbd>.  If you prefer to
restore <code>query-replace</code> to <kbd>GOLD-Enter</kbd>, then use an EDT user
customization file, <samp><span class="file">edt-user.el</span></samp>, to do this
(see <a href="Customizing.html#Customizing">Customizing</a>).

     <li>EDT Emulation now also works in XEmacs, including the highlighting of
selected text.

     <li>If you access a workstation using an X Server, observe that the
initialization file generated by <samp><span class="file">edt-mapper.el</span></samp> will now contain
the name of the X Server vendor.  This is a convenience for those who
have access to their Unix account from more than one type of X Server. 
Since different X Servers typically require different EDT emulation
initialization files, <samp><span class="file">edt-mapper.el</span></samp> will now generate these
different initialization files and save them with different names. 
Then, the correct initialization file for the particular X server in use
is loaded correctly automatically.

     <li>Also, <samp><span class="file">edt-mapper.el</span></samp> is now capable of binding an <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
key sequence, providing the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> key sequence prefix is
already known by Emacs to be a prefix.  As a result of providing this
support, some terminal/keyboard/window system configurations, which
don't have a complete set of sensible function key bindings built into
Emacs in <code>function-key-map</code>, can still be configured for use with
EDT Emulation.  (Note: In a few rare circumstances this does not work
properly.  In particular, it does not work if a subset of the leading
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters in a key sequence are recognized by Emacs as
having an existing binding.  For example, if the keypad 7 (&lt;KP7&gt;)
key generates the sequence &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;ESC&gt;Ow</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;ESC&gt;O</span></samp>&rsquo; is already
bound to a function, pressing &lt;KP7&gt; when told to do so by
<samp><span class="file">edt-mapper.el</span></samp> will result in <samp><span class="file">edt-mapper.el</span></samp> incorrectly
mapping &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;ESC&gt;O</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lt;KP7&gt; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lt;KP8&gt;.  If
something like this happens to you, it is probably a bug in the support
for your keyboard within Emacs <strong>or</strong> a bug in the Unix
termcap/terminfo support for your terminal <strong>or</strong> a bug in the
terminal emulation software you are using.)

     <li>The <code>edt-quit</code> function (bound to <kbd>GOLD-q</kbd> by default) has been
modified to warn the user when file-related buffer modifications exist. 
It now cautions the user that those modifications will be lost if the
user quits without saving those buffers.

        </ol>
