<h2 class="chapter">3 How to Get Started</h2>

<p>Start up GNU Emacs and enter <kbd>M-x edt-emulation-on</kbd> to begin the
emulation.  After initialization is complete, the following message will
appear below the status line informing you that the emulation has been
enabled: &ldquo;Default EDT keymap active&rdquo;.

   <p>You can have the EDT Emulation start up automatically, each time you
initiate a GNU Emacs session, by adding the following line to your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook term-setup-hook 'edt-emulation-on)
</pre>
   <p>A reference sheet is included (later on) listing the default EDT
Emulation key bindings.  This sheet is also accessible on line from
within Emacs by pressing &lt;PF2&gt;, <kbd>GOLD-H</kbd>, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">HELP</span></samp>&rsquo; (when
in the EDT Default Mode).

   <p>It is easy to customize key bindings in the EDT Emulation
(see <a href="Customizing.html#Customizing">Customizing</a>).  Customizations are placed in a file called
<samp><span class="file">edt-user.el</span></samp>.  The Emacs <samp><span class="file">etc/</span></samp> directory contains an
example.  If <samp><span class="file">edt-user.el</span></samp> is found in your GNU Emacs load path
during EDT Emulation initialization, then the following message will
appear below the status line indicating that the emulation has been
enabled, enhanced by your own customizations: &ldquo;User EDT custom keymap
active&rdquo;.

   <p>Once enabled, it is easy to switch back and forth between your
customized EDT Emulation key bindings and the default EDT Emulation key
bindings.  (Look at the binding to <kbd>GOLD-Z</kbd> in the sample
<samp><span class="file">edt-user.el</span></samp> file.)  It is also easy to turn off the emulation
(via the command <code>edt-emulation-off</code>).  Doing so completely
restores the original key bindings in effect just prior to invoking the
emulation.

   <p>Emacs binds keys to <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters and so does the
real EDT.  Where EDT key bindings and GNU Emacs key bindings conflict,
the default GNU Emacs key bindings are retained by the EDT emulation by
default.  If you are a diehard EDT user you may not like this.  The
<a href="Control-keys.html#Control-keys">Control keys</a> section explains how to change this so that the EDT
bindings to <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters override the default
Emacs bindings.
