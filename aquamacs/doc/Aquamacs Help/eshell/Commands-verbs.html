<h3 class="section">2.1 Commands verbs</h3>

<p>Commands are expressed using <dfn>script</dfn>, a special shorthand language
computers can understand with no trouble.  Script is an extremely simple
language; oddly enough, this is what makes it look so complicated! 
Whereas normal languages use a variety of embellishments, the form of a
script command is always:

<pre class="example">     <var>verb</var> [<var>arguments</var>]
</pre>
   <p>The verb expresses what you want your computer to do.  There are a fixed
number of verbs, although this number is usually quite large.  On the
author's computer, it reaches almost 1400 in number.  But of course,
only a handful of these are really necessary.

   <p>Sometimes, the verb is all that's written.  A verb is always a single
word, usually related to the task it performs.  <samp><span class="command">reboot</span></samp> is a
good example.  Entering that on GNU/Linux will reboot the
computer&mdash;assuming you have sufficient privileges.

   <p>Other verbs require more information.  These are usually very capable
verbs, and must be told specifically what to do.  The extra information
is given in the form of <dfn>arguments</dfn>.  For example, the
<samp><span class="command">echo</span></samp> verb prints back whatever arguments you type.  It
requires these arguments to know what to echo.  A proper use of
<samp><span class="command">echo</span></samp> looks like this:

<pre class="example">     echo This is an example of using echo!
</pre>
   <p>This script command causes the computer to echo back: &ldquo;This is an
example of using echo!&rdquo;

   <p>Although command verbs are always simple words, like <samp><span class="command">reboot</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="command">echo</span></samp>, arguments may have a wide variety of forms.  There are
textual arguments, numerical arguments&mdash;even Lisp arguments. 
Distinguishing these different types of arguments requires special
typing, for the computer to know exactly what you mean.
