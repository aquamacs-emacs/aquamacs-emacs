<h4 class="subsection">4.11.4 Debugging Calc</h4>

<p class="noindent">A few commands exist to help in the debugging of Calc commands. 
See <a href="Programming.html#Programming">Programming</a>, to see the various ways that you can write
your own Calc commands.

   <p><a name="index-Z-T-234"></a><a name="index-calc_002dtiming-235"></a>The <kbd>Z T</kbd> (<code>calc-timing</code>) command turns on and off a mode
in which the timing of slow commands is reported in the Trail. 
Any Calc command that takes two seconds or longer writes a line
to the Trail showing how many seconds it took.  This value is
accurate only to within one second.

   <p>All steps of executing a command are included; in particular, time
taken to format the result for display in the stack and trail is
counted.  Some prompts also count time taken waiting for them to
be answered, while others do not; this depends on the exact
implementation of the command.  For best results, if you are timing
a sequence that includes prompts or multiple commands, define a
keyboard macro to run the whole sequence at once.  Calc's <kbd>X</kbd>
command (see <a href="Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>) will then report the time taken
to execute the whole macro.

   <p>Another advantage of the <kbd>X</kbd> command is that while it is
executing, the stack and trail are not updated from step to step. 
So if you expect the output of your test sequence to leave a result
that may take a long time to format and you don't wish to count
this formatting time, end your sequence with a &lt;DEL&gt; keystroke
to clear the result from the stack.  When you run the sequence with
<kbd>X</kbd>, Calc will never bother to format the large result.

   <p>Another thing <kbd>Z T</kbd> does is to increase the Emacs variable
<code>gc-cons-threshold</code> to a much higher value (two million; the
usual default in Calc is 250,000) for the duration of each command. 
This generally prevents garbage collection during the timing of
the command, though it may cause your Emacs process to grow
abnormally large.  (Garbage collection time is a major unpredictable
factor in the timing of Emacs operations.)

   <p>Another command that is useful when debugging your own Lisp
extensions to Calc is <kbd>M-x calc-pass-errors</kbd>, which disables
the error handler that changes the &ldquo;<code>max-lisp-eval-depth</code>
exceeded&rdquo; message to the much more friendly &ldquo;Computation got
stuck or ran too long.&rdquo;  This handler interferes with the Emacs
Lisp debugger's <code>debug-on-error</code> mode.  Errors are reported
in the handler itself rather than at the true location of the
error.  After you have executed <code>calc-pass-errors</code>, Lisp
errors will be reported correctly but the user-friendly message
will be lost.
