<h3 class="section">15.5 Grabbing from Other Buffers</h3>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-g-2202"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgrab_002dregion-2203"></a>The <kbd>C-x * g</kbd> (<code>calc-grab-region</code>) command takes the text between
point and mark in the current buffer and attempts to parse it as a
vector of values.  Basically, it wraps the text in vector brackets
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ ]</span></samp>&rsquo; unless the text already is enclosed in vector brackets,
then reads the text as if it were an algebraic entry.  The contents
of the vector may be numbers, formulas, or any other Calc objects. 
If the <kbd>C-x * g</kbd> command works successfully, it does an automatic
<kbd>C-x * c</kbd> to enter the Calculator buffer.

   <p>A numeric prefix argument grabs the specified number of lines around
point, ignoring the mark.  A positive prefix grabs from point to the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;th following newline (so that <kbd>M-1 C-x * g</kbd> grabs from point
to the end of the current line); a negative prefix grabs from point
back to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n+1</span></samp>&rsquo;st preceding newline.  In these cases the text
that is grabbed is exactly the same as the text that <kbd>C-k</kbd> would
delete given that prefix argument.

   <p>A prefix of zero grabs the current line; point may be anywhere on the
line.

   <p>A plain <kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix interprets the region between point and mark
as a single number or formula rather than a vector.  For example,
<kbd>C-x * g</kbd> on the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 a b</span></samp>&rsquo; produces the vector of three
values &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[2, a, b]</span></samp>&rsquo;, but <kbd>C-u C-x * g</kbd> on the same region
reads a formula which is a product of three things:  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 a b</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(The text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b</span></samp>&rsquo;, on the other hand, will be grabbed as a
vector of one element by plain <kbd>C-x * g</kbd> because the interpretation
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a, +, b]</span></samp>&rsquo; would be a syntax error.)

   <p>If a different language has been specified (see <a href="Language-Modes.html#Language-Modes">Language Modes</a>),
the grabbed text will be interpreted according to that language.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-r-2204"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgrab_002drectangle-2205"></a>The <kbd>C-x * r</kbd> (<code>calc-grab-rectangle</code>) command takes the text between
point and mark and attempts to parse it as a matrix.  If point and mark
are both in the leftmost column, the lines in between are parsed in their
entirety.  Otherwise, point and mark define the corners of a rectangle
whose contents are parsed.

   <p>Each line of the grabbed area becomes a row of the matrix.  The result
will actually be a vector of vectors, which Calc will treat as a matrix
only if every row contains the same number of values.

   <p>If a line contains a portion surrounded by square brackets (or curly
braces), that portion is interpreted as a vector which becomes a row
of the matrix.  Any text surrounding the bracketed portion on the line
is ignored.

   <p>Otherwise, the entire line is interpreted as a row vector as if it
were surrounded by square brackets.  Leading line numbers (in the
format used in the Calc stack buffer) are ignored.  If you wish to
force this interpretation (even if the line contains bracketed
portions), give a negative numeric prefix argument to the
<kbd>C-x * r</kbd> command.

   <p>If you give a numeric prefix argument of zero or plain <kbd>C-u</kbd>, each
line is instead interpreted as a single formula which is converted into
a one-element vector.  Thus the result of <kbd>C-u C-x * r</kbd> will be a
one-column matrix.  For example, suppose one line of the data is the
expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 a</span></samp>&rsquo;.  A plain <kbd>C-x&nbsp;*&nbsp;r</kbd><!-- /@w --> will interpret this as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[2 a]</span></samp>&rsquo;, which in turn is read as a two-element vector that forms
one row of the matrix.  But a <kbd>C-u C-x * r</kbd> will interpret this row
as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[2*a]</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If you give a positive numeric prefix argument <var>n</var>, then each line
will be split up into columns of width <var>n</var>; each column is parsed
separately as a matrix element.  If a line contained
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2&nbsp;+/-&nbsp;3&nbsp;4&nbsp;+/-&nbsp;5</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->, then grabbing with a prefix argument of 8
would correctly split the line into two error forms.

   <p>See <a href="Matrix-Functions.html#Matrix-Functions">Matrix Functions</a>, to see how to pull the matrix apart into its
constituent rows and columns.  (If it is a
<!-- @math{1\times1} -->
1x1
matrix, just hit <kbd>v u</kbd> (<code>calc-unpack</code>) twice.)

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-_003a-2206"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-_002a-_005f-2207"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgrab_002dsum_002dacross-2208"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgrab_002dsum_002ddown-2209"></a><a name="index-Summing-rows-and-columns-of-data-2210"></a>The <kbd>C-x * :</kbd> (<code>calc-grab-sum-down</code>) command is a handy way to
grab a rectangle of data and sum its columns.  It is equivalent to
typing <kbd>C-x * r</kbd>, followed by <kbd>V R : +</kbd> (the vector reduction
command that sums the columns of a matrix; see <a href="Reducing.html#Reducing">Reducing</a>).  The
result of the command will be a vector of numbers, one for each column
in the input data.  The <kbd>C-x * _</kbd> (<code>calc-grab-sum-across</code>) command
similarly grabs a rectangle and sums its rows by executing <kbd>V&nbsp;R&nbsp;_&nbsp;+</kbd><!-- /@w -->.

   <p>As well as being more convenient, <kbd>C-x * :</kbd> and <kbd>C-x * _</kbd> are also
much faster because they don't actually place the grabbed vector on
the stack.  In a <kbd>C-x * r V R : +</kbd> sequence, formatting the vector
for display on the stack takes a large fraction of the total time
(unless you have planned ahead and used <kbd>v .</kbd> and <kbd>t .</kbd> modes).

   <p>For example, suppose we have a column of numbers in a file which we
wish to sum.  Go to one corner of the column and press <kbd>C-@</kbd> to
set the mark; go to the other corner and type <kbd>C-x * :</kbd>.  Since there
is only one column, the result will be a vector of one number, the sum. 
(You can type <kbd>v u</kbd> to unpack this vector into a plain number if
you want to do further arithmetic with it.)

   <p>To compute the product of the column of numbers, we would have to do
it &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; since there's no special grab-and-multiply command. 
Use <kbd>C-x * r</kbd> to grab the column of numbers into the calculator in
the form of a column matrix.  The statistics command <kbd>u *</kbd> is a
handy way to find the product of a vector or matrix of numbers. 
See <a href="Statistical-Operations.html#Statistical-Operations">Statistical Operations</a>.  Another approach would be to use
an explicit column reduction command, <kbd>V R : *</kbd>.
