<h3 class="section">13.5 The Evaluates-To Operator</h3>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-evalto-2078"></a><a name="index-g_t_003d_003e-2079"></a><a name="index-Evaluates_002dto-operator-2080"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_003d_003e_007d-operator-2081"></a>The special algebraic symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; is known as the <dfn>evaluates-to
operator</dfn>.  (It will show up as an <code>evalto</code> function call in
other language modes like Pascal and LaTeX.)  This is a binary
operator, that is, it has a lefthand and a righthand argument,
although it can be entered with the righthand argument omitted.

   <p>A formula like &lsquo;<samp><var>a</var><span class="samp"> =&gt; </span><var>b</var></samp>&rsquo; is evaluated by Calc as
follows:  First, <var>a</var> is not simplified or modified in any
way.  The previous value of argument <var>b</var> is thrown away; the
formula <var>a</var> is then copied and evaluated as if by the <kbd>=</kbd>
command according to all current modes and stored variable values,
and the result is installed as the new value of <var>b</var>.

   <p>For example, suppose you enter the algebraic formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 + 3 =&gt; 17</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The number 17 is ignored, and the lefthand argument is left in its
unevaluated form; the result is the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 + 3 =&gt; 5</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-s-_003d-2082"></a><a name="index-calc_002devalto-2083"></a>You can enter an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; formula either directly using algebraic
entry (in which case the righthand side may be omitted since it is
going to be replaced right away anyhow), or by using the <kbd>s =</kbd>
(<code>calc-evalto</code>) command, which takes <var>a</var> from the stack
and replaces it with &lsquo;<samp><var>a</var><span class="samp"> =&gt; </span><var>b</var></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Calc keeps track of all &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operators on the stack, and
recomputes them whenever anything changes that might affect their
values, i.e., a mode setting or variable value.  This occurs only
if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator is at the top level of the formula, or
if it is part of a top-level vector.  In other words, pushing
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 + (a =&gt; 17)</span></samp>&rsquo; will change the 17 to the actual value of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; when you enter the formula, but the result will not be
dynamically updated when &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; is changed later because the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator is buried inside a sum.  However, a vector
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operators will be recomputed, since it is convenient
to push a vector like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a =&gt;, b =&gt;, c =&gt;]</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack to
make a concise display of all the variables in your problem. 
(Another way to do this would be to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a, b, c] =&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;,
which provides a slightly different format of display.  You
can use whichever you find easiest to read.)

   <p><a name="index-m-C-2084"></a><a name="index-calc_002dauto_002drecompute-2085"></a>The <kbd>m C</kbd> (<code>calc-auto-recompute</code>) command allows you to
turn this automatic recomputation on or off.  If you turn
recomputation off, you must explicitly recompute an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
operator on the stack in one of the usual ways, such as by
pressing <kbd>=</kbd>.  Turning recomputation off temporarily can save
a lot of time if you will be changing several modes or variables
before you look at the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; entries again.

   <p>Most commands are not especially useful with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operators
as arguments.  For example, given &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + 2 =&gt; 17</span></samp>&rsquo;, it won't
work to type <kbd>1 +</kbd> to get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + 3 =&gt; 18</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you want
to operate on the lefthand side of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator on
the top of the stack, type <kbd>j 1</kbd> (that's the digit &ldquo;one&rdquo;)
to select the lefthand side, execute your commands, then type
<kbd>j u</kbd> to unselect.

   <p>All current modes apply when an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator is computed,
including the current simplification mode.  Recall that the
formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + x</span></samp>&rsquo; is not handled by Calc's default
simplifications, but the <kbd>a s</kbd> command will reduce it to
the simpler form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y + 2 x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You can also type <kbd>m A</kbd>
to enable an Algebraic Simplification mode in which the
equivalent of <kbd>a s</kbd> is used on all of Calc's results. 
If you enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + x =&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; normally, the result will
be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + x =&gt; x + y + x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you change to
Algebraic Simplification mode, the result will be
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + x =&gt; y + 2 x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  However, just pressing <kbd>a s</kbd>
once will have no effect on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + x =&gt; x + y + x</span></samp>&rsquo;,
because the righthand side depends only on the lefthand side
and the current mode settings, and the lefthand side is not
affected by commands like <kbd>a s</kbd>.

   <p>The &ldquo;let&rdquo; command (<kbd>s l</kbd>) has an interesting interaction
with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator.  The <kbd>s l</kbd> command evaluates the
second-to-top stack entry with the top stack entry supplying
a temporary value for a given variable.  As you might expect,
if that stack entry is an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator its righthand
side will temporarily show this value for the variable.  In
fact, all &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;s on the stack will be updated if they refer
to that variable.  But this change is temporary in the sense
that the next command that causes Calc to look at those stack
entries will make them revert to the old variable value.

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  a =&gt; a             2:  a =&gt; 17         2:  a =&gt; a
     1:  a + 1 =&gt; a + 1     1:  a + 1 =&gt; 18     1:  a + 1 =&gt; a + 1
         .                      .                   .
     
                                17 s l a &lt;RET&gt;        p 8 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p>Here the <kbd>p 8</kbd> command changes the current precision,
thus causing the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; forms to be recomputed after the
influence of the &ldquo;let&rdquo; is gone.  The <kbd>d &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> command
(<code>calc-refresh</code>) is a handy way to force the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
operators on the stack to be recomputed without any other
side effects.

   <p><a name="index-s-_003a-2086"></a><a name="index-calc_002dassign-2087"></a><a name="index-assign-2088"></a><a name="index-g_t_003a_003d-2089"></a>Embedded mode also uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operators.  In Embedded mode,
the lefthand side of an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator can refer to variables
assigned elsewhere in the file by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; operators.  The
assignment operator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a := 17</span></samp>&rsquo; does not actually do anything
by itself.  But Embedded mode recognizes it and marks it as a sort
of file-local definition of the variable.  You can enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo;
operators in Algebraic mode, or by using the <kbd>s :</kbd>
(<code>calc-assign</code>) [<code>assign</code>] command which takes a variable
and value from the stack and replaces them with an assignment.

   <p>See <a href="TeX-and-LaTeX-Language-Modes.html#TeX-and-LaTeX-Language-Modes">TeX and LaTeX Language Modes</a>, for the way &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in
TeX language output.  The <dfn>eqn</dfn> mode gives similar
treatment to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.
