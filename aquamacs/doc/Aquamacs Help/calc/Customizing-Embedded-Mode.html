<h3 class="section">17.5 Customizing Embedded Mode</h3>

<p class="noindent">You can modify Embedded mode's behavior by setting various Lisp
variables described here.  These variables are customizable
(see <a href="Customizing-Calc.html#Customizing-Calc">Customizing Calc</a>), or you can use <kbd>M-x set-variable</kbd>
or <kbd>M-x edit-options</kbd> to adjust a variable on the fly. 
(Another possibility would be to use a file-local variable annotation at
the end of the file;
see <a href="../emacs/File-Variables.html#File-Variables">Local Variables in Files</a>.) 
Many of the variables given mentioned here can be set to depend on the
major mode of the editing buffer (see <a href="Customizing-Calc.html#Customizing-Calc">Customizing Calc</a>).

   <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dformula-2242"></a>The <code>calc-embedded-open-formula</code> variable holds a regular
expression for the opening delimiter of a formula.  See <a href="../emacs/Regexp-Search.html#Regexp-Search">Regular Expression Search</a>, to see
how regular expressions work.  Basically, a regular expression is a
pattern that Calc can search for.  A regular expression that considers
blank lines, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$$</span></samp>&rsquo; to be opening delimiters is
<code>"\\`\\|^\n\\|\\$\\$?"</code>.  Just in case the meaning of this
regular expression is not completely plain, let's go through it
in detail.

   <p>The surrounding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">" "</span></samp>&rsquo; marks quote the text between them as a
Lisp string.  If you left them off, <code>set-variable</code> or
<code>edit-options</code> would try to read the regular expression as a
Lisp program.

   <p>The most obvious property of this regular expression is that it
contains indecently many backslashes.  There are actually two levels
of backslash usage going on here.  First, when Lisp reads a quoted
string, all pairs of characters beginning with a backslash are
interpreted as special characters.  Here, <code>\n</code> changes to a
new-line character, and <code>\\</code> changes to a single backslash. 
So the actual regular expression seen by Calc is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\`\|^ (newline) \|\$\$?</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Regular expressions also consider pairs beginning with backslash
to have special meanings.  Sometimes the backslash is used to quote
a character that otherwise would have a special meaning in a regular
expression, like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, which normally means &ldquo;end-of-line,&rdquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, which means that the preceding item is optional.  So
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\$\$?</span></samp>&rsquo; matches either one or two dollar signs.

   <p>The other codes in this regular expression are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;, which matches
&ldquo;beginning-of-line,&rdquo; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo;, which means &ldquo;or,&rdquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\`</span></samp>&rsquo;,
which matches &ldquo;beginning-of-buffer.&rdquo;  So the whole pattern means
that a formula begins at the beginning of the buffer, or on a newline
that occurs at the beginning of a line (i.e., a blank line), or at
one or two dollar signs.

   <p>The default value of <code>calc-embedded-open-formula</code> looks just
like this example, with several more alternatives added on to
recognize various other common kinds of delimiters.

   <p>By the way, the reason to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^\n</span></samp>&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^$</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n\n</span></samp>&rsquo;, which also would appear to match blank lines,
is that the former expression actually &ldquo;consumes&rdquo; only one
newline character as <em>part of</em> the delimiter, whereas the
latter expressions consume zero or two newlines, respectively. 
The former choice gives the most natural behavior when Calc
must operate on a whole formula including its delimiters.

   <p>See the Emacs manual for complete details on regular expressions. 
But just for your convenience, here is a list of all characters
which must be quoted with backslash (like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\$</span></samp>&rsquo;) to avoid
some special interpretation:  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">. * + ? [ ] ^ $ \</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (Note
the backslash in this list; for example, to match &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\[</span></samp>&rsquo; you
must use <code>"\\\\\\["</code>.  An exercise for the reader is to
account for each of these six backslashes!)

   <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dformula-2243"></a>The <code>calc-embedded-close-formula</code> variable holds a regular
expression for the closing delimiter of a formula.  A closing
regular expression to match the above example would be
<code>"\\'\\|\n$\\|\\$\\$?"</code>.  This is almost the same as the
other one, except it now uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\'</span></samp>&rsquo; (&ldquo;end-of-buffer&rdquo;) and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n$</span></samp>&rsquo; (newline occurring at end of line, yet another way
of describing a blank line that is more appropriate for this
case).

   <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dword_002dregexp-2244"></a>The <code>calc-embedded-word-regexp</code> variable holds a regular expression
used to define an expression to look for (a &ldquo;word&rdquo;) when you type
<kbd>C-x * w</kbd> to enable Embedded mode.

   <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dplain-2245"></a>The <code>calc-embedded-open-plain</code> variable is a string which
begins a &ldquo;plain&rdquo; formula written in front of the formatted
formula when <kbd>d p</kbd> mode is turned on.  Note that this is an
actual string, not a regular expression, because Calc must be able
to write this string into a buffer as well as to recognize it. 
The default string is <code>"%%% "</code> (note the trailing space), but may
be different for certain major modes.

   <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dplain-2246"></a>The <code>calc-embedded-close-plain</code> variable is a string which
ends a &ldquo;plain&rdquo; formula.  The default is <code>" %%%\n"</code>, but may be
different for different major modes.  Without
the trailing newline here, the first line of a Big mode formula
that followed might be shifted over with respect to the other lines.

   <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dnew_002dformula-2247"></a>The <code>calc-embedded-open-new-formula</code> variable is a string
which is inserted at the front of a new formula when you type
<kbd>C-x * f</kbd>.  Its default value is <code>"\n\n"</code>.  If this
string begins with a newline character and the <kbd>C-x * f</kbd> is
typed at the beginning of a line, <kbd>C-x * f</kbd> will skip this
first newline to avoid introducing unnecessary blank lines in
the file.

   <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dnew_002dformula-2248"></a>The <code>calc-embedded-close-new-formula</code> variable is the corresponding
string which is inserted at the end of a new formula.  Its default
value is also <code>"\n\n"</code>.  The final newline is omitted by
<kbd>C-x&nbsp;*&nbsp;f</kbd><!-- /@w --> if typed at the end of a line.  (It follows that if
<kbd>C-x * f</kbd> is typed on a blank line, both a leading opening
newline and a trailing closing newline are omitted.)

   <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dannounce_002dformula-2249"></a>The <code>calc-embedded-announce-formula</code> variable is a regular
expression which is sure to be followed by an embedded formula. 
The <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> command searches for this pattern as well as for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; operators.  Note that <kbd>C-x * a</kbd> will
not activate just anything surrounded by formula delimiters; after
all, blank lines are considered formula delimiters by default! 
But if your language includes a delimiter which can only occur
actually in front of a formula, you can take advantage of it here. 
The default pattern is <code>"%Embed\n\\(% .*\n\\)*"</code>, but may be
different for different major modes. 
This pattern will check for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%Embed</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by any number of
lines beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; and a space.  This last is important to
make Calc consider mode annotations part of the pattern, so that the
formula's opening delimiter really is sure to follow the pattern.

   <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dopen_002dmode-2250"></a>The <code>calc-embedded-open-mode</code> variable is a string (not a
regular expression) which should precede a mode annotation. 
Calc never scans for this string; Calc always looks for the
annotation itself.  But this is the string that is inserted before
the opening bracket when Calc adds an annotation on its own. 
The default is <code>"% "</code>, but may be different for different major
modes.

   <p><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dclose_002dmode-2251"></a>The <code>calc-embedded-close-mode</code> variable is a string which
follows a mode annotation written by Calc.  Its default value
is simply a newline, <code>"\n"</code>, but may be different for different
major modes.  If you change this, it is a good idea still to end with a
newline so that mode annotations will appear on lines by themselves.
