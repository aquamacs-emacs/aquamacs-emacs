<h5 class="subsubsection">18.5.7.9 Hooks</h5>

<p class="noindent">Hooks are variables which contain Lisp functions (or lists of functions)
which are called at various times.  Calc defines a number of hooks
that help you to customize it in various ways.  Calc uses the Lisp
function <code>run-hooks</code> to invoke the hooks shown below.  Several
other customization-related variables are also described here.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-load-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dload_002dhook-2546"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called at the end of <samp><span class="file">calc.el</span></samp>, after the file has
been loaded, before any functions in it have been called, but after
<code>calc-mode-map</code> and similar variables have been set up. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-ext-load-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dext_002dload_002dhook-2547"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called at the end of <samp><span class="file">calc-ext.el</span></samp>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-start-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dstart_002dhook-2548"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called as the last step in a <kbd>M-x calc</kbd> command. 
At this point, the Calc buffer has been created and initialized if
necessary, the Calc window and trail window have been created,
and the &ldquo;Welcome to Calc&rdquo; message has been displayed. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-mode-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dmode_002dhook-2549"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called when the Calc buffer is being created.  Usually
this will only happen once per Emacs session.  The hook is called
after Emacs has switched to the new buffer, the mode-settings file
has been read if necessary, and all other buffer-local variables
have been set up.  After this hook returns, Calc will perform a
<code>calc-refresh</code> operation, set up the mode line display, then
evaluate any deferred <code>calc-define</code> properties that have not
been evaluated yet. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-trail-mode-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dtrail_002dmode_002dhook-2550"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called when the Calc Trail buffer is being created. 
It is called as the very last step of setting up the Trail buffer. 
Like <code>calc-mode-hook</code>, this will normally happen only once
per Emacs session. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-end-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dend_002dhook-2551"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called by <code>calc-quit</code>, generally because the user
presses <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> while in Calc.  The Calc buffer will
be the current buffer.  The hook is called as the very first
step, before the Calc window is destroyed. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-window-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dwindow_002dhook-2552"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this hook is non-<code>nil</code>, it is called to create the Calc window. 
Upon return, this new Calc window should be the current window. 
(The Calc buffer will already be the current buffer when the
hook is called.)  If the hook is not defined, Calc will
generally use <code>split-window</code>, <code>set-window-buffer</code>,
and <code>select-window</code> to create the Calc window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-trail-window-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dtrail_002dwindow_002dhook-2553"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this hook is non-<code>nil</code>, it is called to create the Calc Trail
window.  The variable <code>calc-trail-buffer</code> will contain the buffer
which the window should use.  Unlike <code>calc-window-hook</code>, this hook
must <em>not</em> switch into the new window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-embedded-mode-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dmode_002dhook-2554"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called the first time that Embedded mode is entered. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-embedded-new-buffer-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dnew_002dbuffer_002dhook-2555"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called each time that Embedded mode is entered in a
new buffer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-embedded-new-formula-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dnew_002dformula_002dhook-2556"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called each time that Embedded mode is enabled for a
new formula. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-edit-mode-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dedit_002dmode_002dhook-2557"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called by <code>calc-edit</code> (and the other &ldquo;edit&rdquo;
commands) when the temporary editing buffer is being created. 
The buffer will have been selected and set up to be in
<code>calc-edit-mode</code>, but will not yet have been filled with
text.  (In fact it may still have leftover text from a previous
<code>calc-edit</code> command.) 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-mode-save-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dmode_002dsave_002dhook-2558"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called by the <code>calc-save-modes</code> command,
after Calc's own mode features have been inserted into the
Calc init file and just before the &ldquo;End of mode settings&rdquo;
message is inserted. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-reset-hook</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dreset_002dhook-2559"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This hook is called after <kbd>C-x * 0</kbd> (<code>calc-reset</code>) has
reset all modes.  The Calc buffer will be the current buffer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-other-modes</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dother_002dmodes-2560"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable contains a list of strings.  The strings are
concatenated at the end of the modes portion of the Calc
mode line (after standard modes such as &ldquo;Deg&rdquo;, &ldquo;Inv&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Hyp&rdquo;).  Each string should be a short, single word followed
by a space.  The variable is <code>nil</code> by default. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-mode-map</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dmode_002dmap-2561"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the keymap that is used by Calc mode.  The best time
to adjust it is probably in a <code>calc-mode-hook</code>.  If the
Calc extensions package (<samp><span class="file">calc-ext.el</span></samp>) has not yet been
loaded, many of these keys will be bound to <code>calc-missing-key</code>,
which is a command that loads the extensions package and
&ldquo;retypes&rdquo; the key.  If your <code>calc-mode-hook</code> rebinds
one of these keys, it will probably be overridden when the
extensions are loaded. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-digit-map</b><var><a name="index-calc_002ddigit_002dmap-2562"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the keymap that is used during numeric entry.  Numeric
entry uses the minibuffer, but this map binds every non-numeric
key to <code>calcDigit-nondigit</code> which generally calls
<code>exit-minibuffer</code> and &ldquo;retypes&rdquo; the key. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-alg-ent-map</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dalg_002dent_002dmap-2563"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the keymap that is used during algebraic entry.  This is
mostly a copy of <code>minibuffer-local-map</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-store-var-map</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dstore_002dvar_002dmap-2564"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the keymap that is used during entry of variable names for
commands like <code>calc-store</code> and <code>calc-recall</code>.  This is
mostly a copy of <code>minibuffer-local-completion-map</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-edit-mode-map</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dedit_002dmode_002dmap-2565"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the (sparse) keymap used by <code>calc-edit</code> and other
temporary editing commands.  It binds &lt;RET&gt;, &lt;LFD&gt;,
and <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to <code>calc-edit-finish</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-mode-var-list</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dmode_002dvar_002dlist-2566"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is a list of variables which are saved by <code>calc-save-modes</code>. 
Each entry is a list of two items, the variable (as a Lisp symbol)
and its default value.  When modes are being saved, each variable
is compared with its default value (using <code>equal</code>) and any
non-default variables are written out. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>calc-local-var-list</b><var><a name="index-calc_002dlocal_002dvar_002dlist-2567"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is a list of variables which should be buffer-local to the
Calc buffer.  Each entry is a variable name (as a Lisp symbol). 
These variables also have their default values manipulated by
the <code>calc</code> and <code>calc-quit</code> commands; see <a href="Multiple-Calculators.html#Multiple-Calculators">Multiple Calculators</a>. 
Since <code>calc-mode-hook</code> is called after this list has been
used the first time, your hook should add a variable to the
list and also call <code>make-local-variable</code> itself. 
</p></blockquote></div>
