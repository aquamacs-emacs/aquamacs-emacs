  <p class="noindent"><a name="index-g_t_002b-647" id=
  "index-g_t_002b-647"></a><a name="index-calc_002dplus-648" id=
  "index-calc_002dplus-648"></a><a name="index-g_t_002b-649" id=
  "index-g_t_002b-649"></a>The <kbd>+</kbd>
  (<code>calc-plus</code>) command adds two numbers. The numbers
  may be any of the standard Calc data types. The resulting sum is
  pushed back onto the stack.</p>

  <p>If both arguments of <kbd>+</kbd> are vectors or matrices (of
  matching dimensions), the result is a vector or matrix sum. If
  one argument is a vector and the other a scalar (i.e., a
  non-vector), the scalar is added to each of the elements of the
  vector to form a new vector. If the scalar is not a number, the
  operation is left in symbolic form: Suppose you added
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; to the
  vector &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[1,2]</span></samp>&rsquo;. You may want the result
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1+x,2+x]</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  or you may plan to substitute a 2-vector for
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
  future. Since the Calculator can't tell which interpretation you
  want, it makes the safest assumption. See <a href=
  "Reducing-and-Mapping.html#Reducing-and-Mapping">Reducing and
  Mapping</a>, for a way to add &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; to every element of a vector.</p>

  <p>If either argument of <kbd>+</kbd> is a complex number, the
  result will in general be complex. If one argument is in
  rectangular form and the other polar, the current Polar mode
  determines the form of the result. If Symbolic mode is enabled,
  the sum may be left as a formula if the necessary conversions for
  polar addition are non-trivial.</p>

  <p>If both arguments of <kbd>+</kbd> are HMS forms, the forms are
  added according to the usual conventions of hours-minutes-seconds
  notation. If one argument is an HMS form and the other is a
  number, that number is converted from degrees or radians
  (depending on the current Angular mode) to HMS format and then
  the two HMS forms are added.</p>

  <p>If one argument of <kbd>+</kbd> is a date form, the other can
  be either a real number, which advances the date by a certain
  number of days, or an HMS form, which advances the date by a
  certain amount of time. Subtracting two date forms yields the
  number of days between them. Adding two date forms is
  meaningless, but Calc interprets it as the subtraction of one
  date form and the negative of the other. (The negative of a date
  form can be understood by remembering that dates are stored as
  the number of days before or after Jan 1, 1 AD.)</p>

  <p>If both arguments of <kbd>+</kbd> are error forms, the result
  is an error form with an appropriately computed standard
  deviation. If one argument is an error form and the other is a
  number, the number is taken to have zero error. Error forms may
  have symbolic formulas as their mean and/or error parts; adding
  these will produce a symbolic error form result. However, adding
  an error form to a plain symbolic formula (as in
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a +/- b) +
  c</span></samp>&rsquo;) will not work, for the same reasons just
  mentioned for vectors. Instead you must write
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a +/- b) + (c +/-
  0)</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>If both arguments of <kbd>+</kbd> are modulo forms with equal
  values of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  or if one argument is a modulo form and the other a plain number,
  the result is a modulo form which represents the sum, modulo
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo;, of the
  two values.</p>

  <p>If both arguments of <kbd>+</kbd> are intervals, the result is
  an interval which describes all possible sums of the possible
  input values. If one argument is a plain number, it is treated as
  the interval &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[x&nbsp;..&nbsp;x]</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.</p>

  <p>If one argument of <kbd>+</kbd> is an infinity and the other
  is not, the result is that same infinity. If both arguments are
  infinite and in the same direction, the result is the same
  infinity, but if they are infinite in different directions the
  result is <code>nan</code>.</p>

  "index-g_t_002d-652"></a>The <kbd>-</kbd>
  (<code>calc-minus</code>) command subtracts two values. The top
  number on the stack is subtracted from the one behind it, so that
  the computation <kbd>5 &lt;RET&gt; 2 -</kbd> produces 3, not
  <i>-3</i>. All options available for <kbd>+</kbd> are available
  for <kbd>-</kbd> as well.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g_t_002a-653" id=

  "index-g_t_002a-655"></a>The <kbd>*</kbd>
  (<code>calc-times</code>) command multiplies two numbers. If one
  argument is a vector and the other a scalar, the scalar is
  multiplied by the elements of the vector to produce a new vector.
  If both arguments are vectors, the interpretation depends on the
  dimensions of the vectors: If both arguments are matrices, a
  matrix multiplication is done. If one argument is a matrix and
  the other a plain vector, the vector is interpreted as a row
  vector or column vector, whichever is dimensionally correct. If
  both arguments are plain vectors, the result is a single scalar
  number which is the dot product of the two vectors.</p>

  <p>If one argument of <kbd>*</kbd> is an HMS form and the other a
  number, the HMS form is multiplied by that amount. It is an error
  to multiply two HMS forms together, or to attempt any
  multiplication involving date forms. Error forms, modulo forms,
  and intervals can be multiplied; see the comments for addition of
  those forms. When two error forms or intervals are multiplied
  they are considered to be statistically independent; thus,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[-2 .. 3] * [-2 ..
  3]</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[-6 ..
  9]</span></samp>&rsquo;, whereas &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">[-2&nbsp;..&nbsp;3]&nbsp;^&nbsp;2</span></samp>&rsquo; 
  <!-- /@w --> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0 ..
  9]</span></samp>&rsquo;.</p>

  <p><a name="index-g_t_002f-656" id=
  "index-g_t_002f-656"></a><a name="index-calc_002ddivide-657" id=
  "index-calc_002ddivide-657"></a><a name="index-g_t_002f-658" id=
  "index-g_t_002f-658"></a>The <kbd>/</kbd>
  (<code>calc-divide</code>) command divides two numbers.</p>

  <p>When combining multiplication and division in an algebraic
  formula, it is good style to use parentheses to distinguish
  between possible interpretations; the expression
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a/b*c</span></samp>&rsquo; should
  be written &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">(a/b)*c</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a/(b*c)</span></samp>&rsquo;, as appropriate. Without the
  parentheses, Calc will interpret &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a/b*c</span></samp>&rsquo; as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">a/(b*c)</span></samp>&rsquo;, since in algebraic entry
  Calc gives division a lower precedence than multiplication. (This
  is not standard across all computer languages, and Calc may
  change the precedence depending on the language mode being used.
  See <a href="Language-Modes.html#Language-Modes">Language
  Modes</a>.) This default ordering can be changed by setting the
  customizable variable
  <code>calc-multiplication-has-precedence</code> to
  <code>nil</code> (see <a href=
  "Customizing-Calc.html#Customizing-Calc">Customizing Calc</a>);
  this will give multiplication and division equal precedences.
  Note that Calc's default choice of precedence allows
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a b / c d</span></samp>&rsquo; to
  be used as a shortcut for</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     a b
     ---.
     c d
</pre>

  <p>When dividing a scalar &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo; by a square matrix
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;, the
  computation performed is &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo; times the inverse of
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;. This also
  occurs if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;
  is itself a vector or matrix, in which case the effect is to
  solve the set of linear equations represented by
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;. If
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo; is a
  matrix with the same number of rows as &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;, or a plain vector (which is
  interpreted here as a column vector), then the equation
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A X = B</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  solved for the vector or matrix &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo;. Otherwise, if
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo; is a
  non-square matrix with the same number of <em>columns</em> as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;, the
  equation &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X A =
  B</span></samp>&rsquo; is solved. If you wish a vector
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo; to be
  interpreted as a row vector to be solved as
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X A = B</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  make it into a one-row matrix with <kbd>C-u 1 v p</kbd> first. To
  force a left-handed solution with a square matrix
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;, transpose
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo; before
  dividing, then transpose the result.</p>

  <p>HMS forms can be divided by real numbers or by other HMS
  forms. Error forms can be divided in any combination of ways.
  Modulo forms where both values and the modulo are integers can be
  divided to get an integer modulo form result. Intervals can be
  divided; dividing by an interval that encompasses zero or has
  zero as a limit will result in an infinite interval.</p>

  "index-g_t_005e-661"></a>The <kbd>^</kbd>
  (<code>calc-power</code>) command raises a number to a power. If
  the power is an integer, an exact result is computed using
  repeated multiplications. For non-integer powers, Calc uses
  Newton's method or logarithms and exponentials. Square matrices
  can be raised to integer powers. If either argument is an error
  (or interval or modulo) form, the result is also an error (or
  interval or modulo) form.</p>

  &lt;RET&gt; 3 I ^</kbd> computes the number 5. (This is entirely
  equivalent to <kbd>125 &lt;RET&gt; 1:3 ^</kbd>.)</p>

  "index-g_t_005c-667"></a>The <kbd>\</kbd>
  (<code>calc-idiv</code>) command divides two numbers on the stack
  to produce an integer result. It is equivalent to dividing with
  &lt;/&gt;, then rounding down with <kbd>F</kbd>
  (<code>calc-floor</code>), only a bit more convenient and
  efficient. Also, since it is an all-integer operation when the
  arguments are integers, it avoids problems that <kbd>/ F</kbd>
  would have with floating-point roundoff.</p>

  "index-g_t_0025-670"></a>The <kbd>%</kbd> (<code>calc-mod</code>)
  command performs a &ldquo;modulo&rdquo; (or
  &ldquo;remainder&rdquo;) operation. Mathematically,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a%b = a -
  (a\b)*b</span></samp>&rsquo;, and is defined for all real numbers
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; (except
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b=0</span></samp>&rsquo;). For
  positive &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  the result will always be between 0 (inclusive) and
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;
  (exclusive). Modulo does not work for HMS forms and error forms.
  If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; is a
  modulo form, its modulo is changed to &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, which must be positive real
  number.</p>

  "index-fdiv-673"></a>The <kbd>:</kbd> (<code>calc-fdiv</code>)
  [<code>fdiv</code>] command divides the two integers on the top
  of the stack to produce a fractional result. This is a convenient
  shorthand for enabling Fraction mode (with <kbd>m f</kbd>)
  temporarily and using &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;. Note that during numeric entry the
  <kbd>:</kbd> key is interpreted as a fraction separator, so to
  divide 8 by 6 you would have to type <kbd>8 &lt;RET&gt; 6
  &lt;RET&gt; :</kbd>. (Of course, in this case, it would be much
  easier simply to enter the fraction directly as <kbd>8:6
  &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>!)</p>

  absolute value of a number. The result of <code>abs</code> is
  always a nonnegative real number: With a complex argument, it

  it computes the Frobenius norm, i.e., the square root of the sum
  of the squares of the absolute values of the elements. The
  absolute value of an error form is defined by replacing the mean
  part with its absolute value and leaving the error part the same.
  The absolute value of a modulo form is undefined. The absolute
  value of an interval is defined in the obvious way.</p>

  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sign(a,x)</span></samp>&rsquo;

  id="index-xpon-709"></a>The <kbd>f M</kbd>
  (<code>calc-mant-part</code>) [<code>mant</code>] function
  extracts the &ldquo;mantissa&rdquo; part
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo; of its
  floating-point argument; <kbd>f X</kbd>
  (<code>calc-xpon-part</code>) [<code>xpon</code>] extracts the
  &ldquo;exponent&rdquo; part &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo;. The original number is equal to 
  <!-- @math{m \times 10^e}, -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m * 10^e</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  in the interval &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1.0 ..
  10.0)</span></samp>&rsquo; except that &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">m=e=0</span></samp>&rsquo; if the original number is zero.
  For integers and fractions, <code>mant</code> returns the number
  unchanged and <code>xpon</code> returns zero. The <kbd>v u</kbd>
  (<code>calc-unpack</code>) command can also be used to
  &ldquo;unpack&rdquo; a floating-point number; this produces an
  integer mantissa and exponent, with the constraint that the
  mantissa is not a multiple of ten (again except for the
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m=e=0</span></samp>&rsquo;
  case).</p>

  id="index-scf-712"></a>The <kbd>f S</kbd>
  (<code>calc-scale-float</code>) [<code>scf</code>] function
  scales a number by a given power of ten. Thus,
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">scf(mant(x), xpon(x)) =
  x</span></samp>&rsquo; for any real &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. The second argument must be an
  integer, but the first may actually be any numeric value. For
  example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">scf(5,-2) =
  0.05</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">1:20</span></samp>&rsquo; depending on the current
  Fraction mode.</p>

  (<code>calc-decrement</code>) [<code>decr</code>] and <kbd>f
  ]</kbd> (<code>calc-increment</code>) [<code>incr</code>]
  functions decrease or increase a number by one unit. For
  integers, the effect is obvious. For floating-point numbers, the
  change is by one unit in the last place. For example,
  incrementing &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">12.3456</span></samp>&rsquo; when the current precision is
  6 digits yields &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">12.3457</span></samp>&rsquo;. If the current precision had
  been 8 digits, the result would have been
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">12.345601</span></samp>&rsquo;.
  Incrementing &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">0.0</span></samp>&rsquo; produces <!-- @math{10^{-p}}, -->
   &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10^-p</span></samp>&rsquo;,
  where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  the current precision. These operations are defined only on
  integers and floats. With numeric prefix arguments, they change
  the number by &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; units.</p>

  <p>Note that incrementing followed by decrementing, or
  vice-versa, will almost but not quite always cancel out. Suppose
  the precision is 6 digits and the number
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">9.99999</span></samp>&rsquo; is
  on the stack. Incrementing will produce &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">10.0000</span></samp>&rsquo;; decrementing will produce
  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">9.9999</span></samp>&rsquo;. One
  digit has been dropped. This is an unavoidable consequence of the
  way floating-point numbers work.</p>

  <p>Incrementing a date/time form adjusts it by a certain number
  of seconds. Incrementing a pure date form adjusts it by a certain
  number of days.</p>
