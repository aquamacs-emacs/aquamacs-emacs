ring,&rdquo; from which it can later be &ldquo;yanked&rdquo; by a <kbd>C-y</kbd> command. 
Three common kill commands in normal Emacs are <kbd>C-k</kbd>, which kills
one line, <kbd>C-w</kbd>, which kills the region between mark and point, and
<kbd>M-w</kbd>, which puts the region into the kill ring without actually
deleting it.  All of these commands work in the Calculator, too,
although in the Calculator they operate on whole stack entries, so they
&ldquo;round up&rdquo; the specified region to encompass full lines.  (To copy
only parts of lines, the <kbd>M-C-w</kbd> command in the Calculator will copy
the region to the kill ring without any &ldquo;rounding up&rdquo;, just like the
<kbd>M-w</kbd> command in normal Emacs.)  Also, <kbd>M-k</kbd> has been provided
to complete the set; it puts the current line into the kill ring without
deleting anything.

   <p>The kill commands are unusual in that they pay attention to the location
of the cursor in the Calculator buffer.  If the cursor is on or below
the bottom line, the kill commands operate on the top of the stack. 
Otherwise, they operate on whatever stack element the cursor is on.  The
text is copied into the kill ring exactly as it appears on the screen,
including line numbers if they are enabled.

   <p>A numeric prefix argument to <kbd>C-k</kbd> or <kbd>M-k</kbd> affects the number
of lines killed.  A positive argument kills the current line and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n-1</span></samp>&rsquo;
lines below it.  A negative argument kills the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>&rsquo; lines above the
current line.  Again this mirrors the behavior of the standard Emacs
<kbd>C-k</kbd> command.  Although a whole line is always deleted, <kbd>C-k</kbd>
with no argument copies only the number itself into the kill ring, whereas
<kbd>C-k</kbd> with a prefix argument of 1 copies the number with its trailing
newline.
