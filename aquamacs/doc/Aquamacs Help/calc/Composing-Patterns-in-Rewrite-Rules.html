<h4 class="subsection">11.11.6 Composing Patterns in Rewrite Rules</h4>

<p class="noindent">There are three operators, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!!</span></samp>&rsquo;,
that combine rewrite patterns to make larger patterns.  The
combinations are &ldquo;and,&rdquo; &ldquo;or,&rdquo; and &ldquo;not,&rdquo; respectively, and
these operators are the pattern equivalents of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">||</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; (which operate on zero-or-nonzero logical values).

   <p>Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!!</span></samp>&rsquo; are left in symbolic
form by all regular Calc features; they have special meaning only in
the context of rewrite rule patterns.

   <p>The pattern &lsquo;<samp><var>p1</var><span class="samp"> &amp;&amp;&amp; </span><var>p2</var></samp>&rsquo; matches anything that
matches both <var>p1</var> and <var>p2</var>.  One especially useful case is
when one of <var>p1</var> or <var>p2</var> is a meta-variable.  For example,
here is a rule that operates on error forms:

<pre class="example">     f(x &amp;&amp;&amp; a +/- b, x)  :=  g(x)
</pre>
   <p>This does the same thing, but is arguably simpler than, the rule

<pre class="example">     f(a +/- b, a +/- b)  :=  g(a +/- b)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-ends-1931"></a>Here's another interesting example:

<pre class="example">     ends(cons(a, x) &amp;&amp;&amp; rcons(y, b))  :=  [a, b]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which effectively clips out the middle of a vector leaving just
the first and last elements.  This rule will change a one-element
vector &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a]</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a, a]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The similar rule

<pre class="example">     ends(cons(a, rcons(y, b)))  :=  [a, b]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would do the same thing except that it would fail to match a
one-element vector.

   <p>The pattern &lsquo;<samp><var>p1</var><span class="samp"> ||| </span><var>p2</var></samp>&rsquo; matches anything that
matches either <var>p1</var> or <var>p2</var>.  Calc first tries matching
against <var>p1</var>; if that fails, it goes on to try <var>p2</var>.

   <p><a name="index-curve-1932"></a>A simple example of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo; is

<pre class="example">     curve(inf ||| -inf)  :=  0
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which converts both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">curve(inf)</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">curve(-inf)</span></samp>&rsquo; to zero.

   <p>Here is a larger example:

<pre class="example">     log(a, b) ||| (ln(a) :: let(b := e))  :=  mylog(a, b)
</pre>
   <p>This matches both generalized and natural logarithms in a single rule. 
Note that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo; term must be enclosed in parentheses because
that operator has lower precedence than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>(In practice this rule would probably include a third alternative,
omitted here for brevity, to take care of <code>log10</code>.)

   <p>While Calc generally treats interior conditions exactly the same as
conditions on the outside of a rule, it does guarantee that if all the
variables in the condition are special names like <code>e</code>, or already
bound in the pattern to which the condition is attached (say, if
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; had appeared in this condition), then Calc will process this
condition right after matching the pattern to the left of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">::</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Thus, we know that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; will be bound to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo; only if the
<code>ln</code> branch of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo; was taken.

   <p>Note that this rule was careful to bind the same set of meta-variables
on both sides of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|||</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Calc does not check this, but if
you bind a certain meta-variable only in one branch and then use that
meta-variable elsewhere in the rule, results are unpredictable:

<pre class="example">     f(a,b) ||| g(b)  :=  h(a,b)
</pre>
   <p>Here if the pattern matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g(17)</span></samp>&rsquo;, Calc makes no promises about
the value that will be substituted for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; on the righthand side.

   <p>The pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!! </span><var>pat</var></samp>&rsquo; matches anything that does not
match <var>pat</var>.  Any meta-variables that are bound while matching
<var>pat</var> remain unbound outside of <var>pat</var>.

   <p>For example,

<pre class="example">     f(x &amp;&amp;&amp; !!! a +/- b, !!![])  :=  g(x)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">converts <code>f</code> whose first argument is anything <em>except</em> an
error form, and whose second argument is not the empty vector, into
a similar call to <code>g</code> (but without the second argument).

   <p>If we know that the second argument will be a vector (empty or not),
then an equivalent rule would be:

<pre class="example">     f(x, y)  :=  g(x)  :: typeof(x) != 7 :: vlen(y) &gt; 0
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where of course 7 is the <code>typeof</code> code for error forms. 
Another final condition, that works for any kind of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;,
would be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!istrue(y == [])</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (The <code>istrue</code> function
returns an explicit 0 if its argument was left in symbolic form;
plain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!(y == [])</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y != []</span></samp>&rsquo; would not work to replace
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!![]</span></samp>&rsquo; since these would be left unsimplified, and thus cause
the rule to fail, if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; was something like a variable name.)

   <p>It is possible for a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!!</span></samp>&rsquo; to refer to meta-variables bound
elsewhere in the pattern.  For example,

<pre class="example">     f(a, !!!a)  :=  g(a)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">matches any call to <code>f</code> with different arguments, changing
this to <code>g</code> with only the first argument.

   <p>If a function call is to be matched and one of the argument patterns
contains a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!!</span></samp>&rsquo; somewhere inside it, that argument will be
matched last.  Thus

<pre class="example">     f(!!!a, a)  :=  g(a)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will be careful to bind &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; to the second argument of <code>f</code>
before testing the first argument.  If Calc had tried to match the
first argument of <code>f</code> first, the results would have been
disastrous: since <code>a</code> was unbound so far, the pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;
would have matched anything at all, and the pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!!a</span></samp>&rsquo;
therefore would <em>not</em> have matched anything at all!
