<h4 class="subsection">7.4.6 Matrix and Scalar Modes</h4>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-Matrix-mode-432"></a><a name="index-Scalar-mode-433"></a>Calc sometimes makes assumptions during algebraic manipulation that
are awkward or incorrect when vectors and matrices are involved. 
Calc has two modes, <dfn>Matrix mode</dfn> and <dfn>Scalar mode</dfn>, which
modify its behavior around vectors in useful ways.

   <p><a name="index-m-v-434"></a><a name="index-calc_002dmatrix_002dmode-435"></a>Press <kbd>m v</kbd> (<code>calc-matrix-mode</code>) once to enter Matrix mode. 
In this mode, all objects are assumed to be matrices unless provably
otherwise.  One major effect is that Calc will no longer consider
multiplication to be commutative.  (Recall that in matrix arithmetic,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A*B</span></samp>&rsquo; is not the same as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B*A</span></samp>&rsquo;.)  This assumption affects
rewrite rules and algebraic simplification.  Another effect of this
mode is that calculations that would normally produce constants like
0 and 1 (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a - a</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a / a</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively) will now
produce function calls that represent &ldquo;generic&rdquo; zero or identity
matrices: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idn(0)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idn(1)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The <code>idn</code> function
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idn(</span><var>a</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; returns <var>a</var> times an <var>n</var>x<var>n</var>
identity matrix; if <var>n</var> is omitted, it doesn't know what
dimension to use and so the <code>idn</code> call remains in symbolic
form.  However, if this generic identity matrix is later combined
with a matrix whose size is known, it will be converted into
a true identity matrix of the appropriate size.  On the other hand,
if it is combined with a scalar (as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idn(1) + 2</span></samp>&rsquo;), Calc
will assume it really was a scalar after all and produce, e.g., 3.

   <p>Press <kbd>m v</kbd> a second time to get Scalar mode.  Here, objects are
assumed <em>not</em> to be vectors or matrices unless provably so. 
For example, normally adding a variable to a vector, as in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[x, y, z] + a</span></samp>&rsquo;, will leave the sum in symbolic form because
as far as Calc knows, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; could represent either a number or
another 3-vector.  In Scalar mode, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; is assumed to be a
non-vector, and the addition is evaluated to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[x+a, y+a, z+a]</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Press <kbd>m v</kbd> a third time to return to the normal mode of operation.

   <p>If you press <kbd>m v</kbd> with a numeric prefix argument <var>n</var>, you
get a special &ldquo;dimensioned&rdquo; Matrix mode in which matrices of
unknown size are assumed to be <var>n</var>x<var>n</var> square matrices. 
Then, the function call &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idn(1)</span></samp>&rsquo; will expand into an actual
matrix rather than representing a &ldquo;generic&rdquo; matrix.  Simply typing
<kbd>C-u m v</kbd> will get you a square Matrix mode, in which matrices of
unknown size are assumed to be square matrices of unspecified size.

   <p><a name="index-Declaring-scalar-variables-436"></a>Of course these modes are approximations to the true state of
affairs, which is probably that some quantities will be matrices
and others will be scalars.  One solution is to &ldquo;declare&rdquo;
certain variables or functions to be scalar-valued. 
See <a href="Declarations.html#Declarations">Declarations</a>, to see how to make declarations in Calc.

   <p>There is nothing stopping you from declaring a variable to be
scalar and then storing a matrix in it; however, if you do, the
results you get from Calc may not be valid.  Suppose you let Calc
get the result &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[x+a, y+a, z+a]</span></samp>&rsquo; shown above, and then stored
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1, 2, 3]</span></samp>&rsquo; in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The result would not be the same as
for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[x, y, z] + [1, 2, 3]</span></samp>&rsquo;, but that's because you have broken
your earlier promise to Calc that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; would be scalar.

   <p>Another way to mix scalars and matrices is to use selections
(see <a href="Selecting-Subformulas.html#Selecting-Subformulas">Selecting Subformulas</a>).  Use Matrix mode when operating on
your formula normally; then, to apply Scalar mode to a certain part
of the formula without affecting the rest just select that part,
change into Scalar mode and press <kbd>=</kbd> to resimplify the part
under this mode, then change back to Matrix mode before deselecting.
