<h3 class="section">15.7 X Cut and Paste</h3>

<p class="noindent">If you are using Emacs with the X window system, there is an easier
way to move small amounts of data into and out of the calculator:
Use the mouse-oriented cut and paste facilities of X.

   <p>The default bindings for a three-button mouse cause the left button
to move the Emacs cursor to the given place, the right button to
select the text between the cursor and the clicked location, and
the middle button to yank the selection into the buffer at the
clicked location.  So, if you have a Calc window and an editing
window on your Emacs screen, you can use left-click/right-click
to select a number, vector, or formula from one window, then
middle-click to paste that value into the other window.  When you
paste text into the Calc window, Calc interprets it as an algebraic
entry.  It doesn't matter where you click in the Calc window; the
new value is always pushed onto the top of the stack.

   <p>The <code>xterm</code> program that is typically used for general-purpose
shell windows in X interprets the mouse buttons in the same way. 
So you can use the mouse to move data between Calc and any other
Unix program.  One nice feature of <code>xterm</code> is that a double
left-click selects one word, and a triple left-click selects a
whole line.  So you can usually transfer a single number into Calc
just by double-clicking on it in the shell, then middle-clicking
in the Calc window.
