<h3 class="section">5.9 Date Forms</h3>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-Date-forms-271"></a>A <dfn>date form</dfn> represents a date and possibly an associated time. 
Simple date arithmetic is supported:  Adding a number to a date
produces a new date shifted by that many days; adding an HMS form to
a date shifts it by that many hours.  Subtracting two date forms
computes the number of days between them (represented as a simple
number).  Many other operations, such as multiplying two date forms,
are nonsensical and are not allowed by Calc.

   <p>Date forms are entered and displayed enclosed in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt; &gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; brackets. 
The default format is, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;Wed Jan 9, 1991&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; for dates,
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;3:32:20pm Wed Jan 9, 1991&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; for dates with times. 
Input is flexible; date forms can be entered in any of the usual
notations for dates and times.  See <a href="Date-Formats.html#Date-Formats">Date Formats</a>.

   <p>Date forms are stored internally as numbers, specifically the number
of days since midnight on the morning of January 1 of the year 1 AD. 
If the internal number is an integer, the form represents a date only;
if the internal number is a fraction or float, the form represents
a date and time.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;6:00am Wed Jan 9, 1991&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
is represented by the number 726842.25.  The standard precision of
12 decimal digits is enough to ensure that a (reasonable) date and
time can be stored without roundoff error.

   <p>If the current precision is greater than 12, date forms will keep
additional digits in the seconds position.  For example, if the
precision is 15, the seconds will keep three digits after the
decimal point.  Decreasing the precision below 12 may cause the
time part of a date form to become inaccurate.  This can also happen
if astronomically high years are used, though this will not be an
issue in everyday (or even everymillennium) use.  Note that date
forms without times are stored as exact integers, so roundoff is
never an issue for them.

   <p>You can use the <kbd>v p</kbd> (<code>calc-pack</code>) and <kbd>v u</kbd>
(<code>calc-unpack</code>) commands to get at the numerical representation
of a date form.  See <a href="Packing-and-Unpacking.html#Packing-and-Unpacking">Packing and Unpacking</a>.

   <p>Date forms can go arbitrarily far into the future or past.  Negative
year numbers represent years BC.  Calc uses a combination of the
Gregorian and Julian calendars, following the history of Great
Britain and the British colonies.  This is the same calendar that
is used by the <code>cal</code> program in most Unix implementations.

   <p><a name="index-Julian-calendar-272"></a><a name="index-Gregorian-calendar-273"></a>Some historical background:  The Julian calendar was created by
Julius Caesar in the year 46 BC as an attempt to fix the gradual
drift caused by the lack of leap years in the calendar used
until that time.  The Julian calendar introduced an extra day in
all years divisible by four.  After some initial confusion, the
calendar was adopted around the year we call 8 AD.  Some centuries
later it became apparent that the Julian year of 365.25 days was
itself not quite right.  In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII introduced the
Gregorian calendar, which added the new rule that years divisible
by 100, but not by 400, were not to be considered leap years
despite being divisible by four.  Many countries delayed adoption
of the Gregorian calendar because of religious differences;
in Britain it was put off until the year 1752, by which time
the Julian calendar had fallen eleven days behind the true
seasons.  So the switch to the Gregorian calendar in early
September 1752 introduced a discontinuity:  The day after
Sep 2, 1752 is Sep 14, 1752.  Calc follows this convention. 
To take another example, Russia waited until 1918 before
adopting the new calendar, and thus needed to remove thirteen
days (between Feb 1, 1918 and Feb 14, 1918).  This means that
Calc's reckoning will be inconsistent with Russian history between
1752 and 1918, and similarly for various other countries.

   <p>Today's timekeepers introduce an occasional &ldquo;leap second&rdquo; as
well, but Calc does not take these minor effects into account. 
(If it did, it would have to report a non-integer number of days
between, say, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;12:00am Mon Jan 1, 1900&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;12:00am Sat Jan 1, 2000&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

   <p>Calc uses the Julian calendar for all dates before the year 1752,
including dates BC when the Julian calendar technically had not
yet been invented.  Thus the claim that day number <i>-10000</i> is
called &ldquo;August 16, 28 BC&rdquo; should be taken with a grain of salt.

   <p>Please note that there is no &ldquo;year 0&rdquo;; the day before
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;Sat Jan 1, +1&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;Fri Dec 31, -1&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  These are
days 0 and <i>-1</i> respectively in Calc's internal numbering scheme.

   <p><a name="index-Julian-day-counting-274"></a>Another day counting system in common use is, confusingly, also called
&ldquo;Julian.&rdquo;  The Julian day number is the numbers of days since
12:00 noon (GMT) on Jan 1, 4713 BC, which in Calc's scheme (in GMT)
is <i>-1721423.5</i> (recall that Calc starts at midnight instead
of noon).  Thus to convert a Calc date code obtained by unpacking a
date form into a Julian day number, simply add 1721423.5 after
compensating for the time zone difference.  The built-in <kbd>t J</kbd>
command performs this conversion for you.

   <p>The Julian day number is based on the Julian cycle, which was invented
in 1583 by Joseph Justus Scaliger.  Scaliger named it the Julian cycle
since it involves the Julian calendar, but some have suggested that
Scaliger named it in honor of his father, Julius Caesar Scaliger.  The
Julian cycle is based on three other cycles: the indiction cycle, the
Metonic cycle, and the solar cycle.  The indiction cycle is a 15 year
cycle originally used by the Romans for tax purposes but later used to
date medieval documents.  The Metonic cycle is a 19 year cycle; 19
years is close to being a common multiple of a solar year and a lunar
month, and so every 19 years the phases of the moon will occur on the
same days of the year.  The solar cycle is a 28 year cycle; the Julian
calendar repeats itself every 28 years.  The smallest time period
which contains multiples of all three cycles is the least common
multiple of 15 years, 19 years and 28 years, which (since they're
pairwise relatively prime) is
<!-- @math{15\times 19\times 28 = 7980} years. -->
15*19*28 = 7980 years. 
This is the length of a Julian cycle.  Working backwards, the previous
year in which all three cycles began was 4713 BC, and so Scalinger
chose that year as the beginning of a Julian cycle.  Since at the time
there were no historical records from before 4713 BC, using this year
as a starting point had the advantage of avoiding negative year
numbers.  In 1849, the astronomer John Herschel (son of William
Herschel) suggested using the number of days since the beginning of
the Julian cycle as an astronomical dating system; this idea was taken
up by other astronomers.  (At the time, noon was the start of the
astronomical day.  Herschel originally suggested counting the days
since Jan 1, 4713 BC at noon Alexandria time; this was later amended to
noon GMT.)  Julian day numbering is largely used in astronomy.

   <p><a name="index-Unix-time-format-275"></a>The Unix operating system measures time as an integer number of
seconds since midnight, Jan 1, 1970.  To convert a Calc date
value into a Unix time stamp, first subtract 719164 (the code
for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;Jan 1, 1970&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;), then multiply by 86400 (the number of
seconds in a day) and press <kbd>R</kbd> to round to the nearest
integer.  If you have a date form, you can simply subtract the
day &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;Jan 1, 1970&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of unpacking and subtracting
719164.  Likewise, divide by 86400 and add &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;Jan 1, 1970&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
to convert from Unix time to a Calc date form.  (Note that
Unix normally maintains the time in the GMT time zone; you may
need to subtract five hours to get New York time, or eight hours
for California time.  The same is usually true of Julian day
counts.)  The built-in <kbd>t U</kbd> command performs these
conversions.
