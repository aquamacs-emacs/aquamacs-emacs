<h4 class="subsection">11.5.3 Customizing the Integrator</h4>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-IntegRules-1741"></a>Calc has two built-in rewrite rules called <code>IntegRules</code> and
<code>IntegAfterRules</code> which you can edit to define new integration
methods.  See <a href="Rewrite-Rules.html#Rewrite-Rules">Rewrite Rules</a>.  At each step of the integration process,
Calc wraps the current integrand in a call to the fictitious function
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">integtry(</span><var>expr</var><span class="samp">,</span><var>var</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>expr</var> is the
integrand and <var>var</var> is the integration variable.  If your rules
rewrite this to be a plain formula (not a call to <code>integtry</code>), then
Calc will use this formula as the integral of <var>expr</var>.  For example,
the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">integtry(mysin(x),x) := -mycos(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; would define a rule to
integrate a function <code>mysin</code> that acts like the sine function. 
Then, putting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4 mysin(2y+1)</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack and typing <kbd>a i y</kbd>
will produce the integral &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-2 mycos(2y+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Note that Calc has
automatically made various transformations on the integral to allow it
to use your rule; integral tables generally give rules for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mysin(a x + b)</span></samp>&rsquo;, but you don't need to use this much generality
in your <code>IntegRules</code>.

   <p><a name="index-Exponential-integral-Ei_0028x_0029-1742"></a><a name="index-Ei-1743"></a>As a more serious example, the expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(x)/x</span></samp>&rsquo; cannot be
integrated in terms of the standard functions, so the &ldquo;exponential
integral&rdquo; function
<!-- @math{{\rm Ei}(x)} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ei(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
was invented to describe it. 
We can get Calc to do this integral in terms of a made-up <code>Ei</code>
function by adding the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[integtry(exp(x)/x, x) := Ei(x)]</span></samp>&rsquo;
to <code>IntegRules</code>.  Now entering &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(2x)/x</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack
and typing <kbd>a i x</kbd> yields &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ei(2 x)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This new rule will
work with Calc's various built-in integration methods (such as
integration by substitution) to solve a variety of other problems
involving <code>Ei</code>:  For example, now Calc will also be able to
integrate &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(exp(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln(ln(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; (to get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ei(exp(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x ln(ln(x)) - Ei(ln(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively).

   <p>Your rule may do further integration by calling <code>integ</code>.  For
example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">integtry(twice(u),x) := twice(integ(u))</span></samp>&rsquo; allows Calc
to integrate &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">twice(sin(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; to get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">twice(-cos(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Note that <code>integ</code> was called with only one argument.  This notation
is allowed only within <code>IntegRules</code>; it means &ldquo;integrate this
with respect to the same integration variable.&rdquo;  If Calc is unable
to integrate <code>u</code>, the integration that invoked <code>IntegRules</code>
also fails.  Thus integrating &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">twice(f(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; fails, returning the
unevaluated integral &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">integ(twice(f(x)), x)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It is still valid
to call <code>integ</code> with two or more arguments, however; in this case,
if <code>u</code> is not integrable, <code>twice</code> itself will still be
integrated:  If the above rule is changed to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">... := twice(integ(u,x))</span></samp>&rsquo;,
then integrating &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">twice(f(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; will yield &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">twice(integ(f(x),x))</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If a rule instead produces the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">integsubst(</span><var>sexpr</var><span class="samp">,
</span><var>svar</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, either replacing the top-level <code>integtry</code> call or
nested anywhere inside the expression, then Calc will apply the
substitution &lsquo;<samp><var>u</var><span class="samp"> = </span><var>sexpr</var><span class="samp">(</span><var>svar</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; to try to
integrate the original <var>expr</var>.  For example, the rule
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(a) := integsubst(sqrt(x),x)</span></samp>&rsquo; says that if Calc ever finds
a square root in the integrand, it should attempt the substitution
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u = sqrt(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (This particular rule is unnecessary because
Calc always tries &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; substitutions where <var>sexpr</var> actually
appears in the integrand.)  The variable <var>svar</var> may be the same
as the <var>var</var> that appeared in the call to <code>integtry</code>, but
it need not be.

   <p>When integrating according to an <code>integsubst</code>, Calc uses the
equation solver to find the inverse of <var>sexpr</var> (if the integrand
refers to <var>var</var> anywhere except in subexpressions that exactly
match <var>sexpr</var>).  It uses the differentiator to find the derivative
of <var>sexpr</var> and/or its inverse (it has two methods that use one
derivative or the other).  You can also specify these items by adding
extra arguments to the <code>integsubst</code> your rules construct; the
general form is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">integsubst(</span><var>sexpr</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>svar</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>sinv</var><span class="samp">,
</span><var>sprime</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>sinv</var> is the inverse of <var>sexpr</var> (still
written as a function of <var>svar</var>), and <var>sprime</var> is the
derivative of <var>sexpr</var> with respect to <var>svar</var>.  If you don't
specify these things, and Calc is not able to work them out on its
own with the information it knows, then your substitution rule will
work only in very specific, simple cases.

   <p>Calc applies <code>IntegRules</code> as if by <kbd>C-u 1 a r IntegRules</kbd>;
in other words, Calc stops rewriting as soon as any rule in your rule
set succeeds.  (If it weren't for this, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">integsubst(sqrt(x),x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
example above would keep on adding layers of <code>integsubst</code> calls
forever!)

   <p><a name="index-IntegSimpRules-1744"></a>Another set of rules, stored in <code>IntegSimpRules</code>, are applied
every time the integrator uses <kbd>a s</kbd> to simplify an intermediate
result.  For example, putting the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">twice(x) := 2 x</span></samp>&rsquo; into
<code>IntegSimpRules</code> would tell Calc to convert the <code>twice</code>
function into a form it knows whenever integration is attempted.

   <p>One more way to influence the integrator is to define a function with
the <kbd>Z F</kbd> command (see <a href="Algebraic-Definitions.html#Algebraic-Definitions">Algebraic Definitions</a>).  Calc's
integrator automatically expands such functions according to their
defining formulas, even if you originally asked for the function to
be left unevaluated for symbolic arguments.  (Certain other Calc
systems, such as the differentiator and the equation solver, also
do this.)

   <p><a name="index-IntegAfterRules-1745"></a>Sometimes Calc is able to find a solution to your integral, but it
expresses the result in a way that is unnecessarily complicated.  If
this happens, you can either use <code>integsubst</code> as described
above to try to hint at a more direct path to the desired result, or
you can use <code>IntegAfterRules</code>.  This is an extra rule set that
runs after the main integrator returns its result; basically, Calc does
an <kbd>a r IntegAfterRules</kbd> on the result before showing it to you. 
(It also does an <kbd>a s</kbd>, without <code>IntegSimpRules</code>, after that
to further simplify the result.)  For example, Calc's integrator
sometimes produces expressions of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln(1+x) - ln(1-x)</span></samp>&rsquo;;
the default <code>IntegAfterRules</code> rewrite this into the more readable
form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 arctanh(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Note that, unlike <code>IntegRules</code>,
<code>IntegSimpRules</code> and <code>IntegAfterRules</code> are applied any number
of times until no further changes are possible.  Rewriting by
<code>IntegAfterRules</code> occurs only after the main integrator has
finished, not at every step as for <code>IntegRules</code> and
<code>IntegSimpRules</code>.
