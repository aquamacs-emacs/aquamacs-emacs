<h4 class="subsection">11.8.5 Curve Fitting Details</h4>

<p class="noindent">Calc's internal least-squares fitter can only handle multilinear
models.  More precisely, it can handle any model of the form
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a f(x,y,z) + b g(x,y,z) + c h(x,y,z)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a,b,c</span></samp>&rsquo;
are the parameters and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x,y,z</span></samp>&rsquo; are the independent variables
(of course there can be any number of each, not just three).

   <p>In a simple multilinear or polynomial fit, it is easy to see how
to convert the model into this form.  For example, if the model
is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b x + c x^2</span></samp>&rsquo;, then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(x) = 1</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g(x) = x</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h(x) = x^2</span></samp>&rsquo; are suitable functions.

   <p>For most other models, Calc uses a variety of algebraic manipulations
to try to put the problem into the form

<pre class="smallexample">     Y(x,y,z) = A(a,b,c) F(x,y,z) + B(a,b,c) G(x,y,z) + C(a,b,c) H(x,y,z)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Y,A,B,C,F,G,H</span></samp>&rsquo; are arbitrary functions.  It computes
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Y</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">H</span></samp>&rsquo; for all the data points,
does a standard linear fit to find the values of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;, then uses the equation solver to solve for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a,b,c</span></samp>&rsquo;
in terms of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A,B,C</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>A remarkable number of models can be cast into this general form. 
We'll look at two examples here to see how it works.  The power-law
model &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y = a x^b</span></samp>&rsquo; with two independent variables and two parameters
can be rewritten as follows:

<pre class="example">     y = a x^b
     y = a exp(b ln(x))
     y = exp(ln(a) + b ln(x))
     ln(y) = ln(a) + b ln(x)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which matches the desired form with
<!-- @math{Y = \ln(y)}, -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Y = ln(y)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
<!-- @math{A = \ln(a)}, -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A = ln(a)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F = 1</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B = b</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
<!-- @math{G = \ln(x)}. -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">G = ln(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Calc thus computes the logarithms of your &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; values,
does a linear fit for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;, then solves to get
<!-- @math{a = \exp(A)} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a = exp(A)</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b = B</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Another interesting example is the &ldquo;quadratic&rdquo; model, which can
be handled by expanding according to the distributive law.

<pre class="example">     y = a + b*(x - c)^2
     y = a + b c^2 - 2 b c x + b x^2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which matches with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Y = y</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A = a + b c^2</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F = 1</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B = -2 b c</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">G = x</span></samp>&rsquo; (the <i>-2</i> factor could just as easily
have been put into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;), &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C = b</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">H = x^2</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The Gaussian model looks quite complicated, but a closer examination
shows that it's actually similar to the quadratic model but with an
exponential that can be brought to the top and moved into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Y</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The logistic models cannot be put into general linear form.  For these
models, and the Hubbert linearization, Calc computes a rough
approximation for the parameters, then uses the Levenberg-Marquardt
iterative method to refine the approximations.

   <p>Another model that cannot be put into general linear
form is a Gaussian with a constant background added on, i.e.,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo; + the regular Gaussian formula.  If you have a model like
this, your best bet is to replace enough of your parameters with
constants to make the model linearizable, then adjust the constants
manually by doing a series of fits.  You can compare the fits by
graphing them, by examining the goodness-of-fit measures returned by
<kbd>I a F</kbd>, or by some other method suitable to your application. 
Note that some models can be linearized in several ways.  The
Gaussian-plus-<var>d</var> model can be linearized by setting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;
(the background) to a constant, or by setting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; (the standard
deviation) and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; (the mean) to constants.

   <p>To fit a model with constants substituted for some parameters, just
store suitable values in those parameter variables, then omit them
from the list of parameters when you answer the variables prompt.

   <p>A last desperate step would be to use the general-purpose
<code>minimize</code> function rather than <code>fit</code>.  After all, both
functions solve the problem of minimizing an expression (the
<!-- @math{\chi^2} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">chi^2</span></samp>&rsquo;
sum) by adjusting certain parameters in the expression.  The <kbd>a F</kbd>
command is able to use a vastly more efficient algorithm due to its
special knowledge about linear chi-square sums, but the <kbd>a N</kbd>
command can do the same thing by brute force.

   <p>A compromise would be to pick out a few parameters without which the
fit is linearizable, and use <code>minimize</code> on a call to <code>fit</code>
which efficiently takes care of the rest of the parameters.  The thing
to be minimized would be the value of
<!-- @math{\chi^2} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">chi^2</span></samp>&rsquo;
returned as the fifth result of the <code>xfit</code> function:

<pre class="smallexample">     minimize(xfit(gaus(a,b,c,d,x), x, [a,b,c], data)_5, d, guess)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <code>gaus</code> represents the Gaussian model with background,
<code>data</code> represents the data matrix, and <code>guess</code> represents
the initial guess for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo; that <code>minimize</code> requires. 
This operation will only be, shall we say, extraordinarily slow
rather than astronomically slow (as would be the case if <code>minimize</code>
were used by itself to solve the problem).

   <p>The <kbd>I a F</kbd> [<code>xfit</code>] command is somewhat trickier when
nonlinear models are used.  The second item in the result is the
vector of &ldquo;raw&rdquo; parameters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The
covariance matrix is written in terms of those raw parameters. 
The fifth item is a vector of <dfn>filter</dfn> expressions.  This
is the empty vector &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo; if the raw parameters were the same
as the requested parameters, i.e., if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A = a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B = b</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and so on (which is always true if the model is already linear
in the parameters as written, e.g., for polynomial fits).  If the
parameters had to be rearranged, the fifth item is instead a vector
of one formula per parameter in the original model.  The raw
parameters are expressed in these &ldquo;filter&rdquo; formulas as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitdummy(1)</span></samp>&rsquo; for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitdummy(2)</span></samp>&rsquo; for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and so on.

   <p>When Calc needs to modify the model to return the result, it replaces
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitdummy(1)</span></samp>&rsquo; in all the filters with the first item in the raw
parameters list, and so on for the other raw parameters, then
evaluates the resulting filter formulas to get the actual parameter
values to be substituted into the original model.  In the case of
<kbd>H a F</kbd> and <kbd>I a F</kbd> where the parameters must be error forms,
Calc uses the square roots of the diagonal entries of the covariance
matrix as error values for the raw parameters, then lets Calc's
standard error-form arithmetic take it from there.

   <p>If you use <kbd>I a F</kbd> with a nonlinear model, be sure to remember
that the covariance matrix is in terms of the raw parameters,
<em>not</em> the actual requested parameters.  It's up to you to
figure out how to interpret the covariances in the presence of
nontrivial filter functions.

   <p>Things are also complicated when the input contains error forms. 
Suppose there are three independent and dependent variables, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo;, one or more of which are error forms in the
data.  Calc combines all the error values by taking the square root
of the sum of the squares of the errors.  It then changes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; to be plain numbers, and makes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo; into an error
form with this combined error.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Y(x,y,z)</span></samp>&rsquo; part of the
linearized model is evaluated, and the result should be an error
form.  The error part of that result is used for
<!-- @math{\sigma_i} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sigma_i</span></samp>&rsquo;
for the data point.  If for some reason &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Y(x,y,z)</span></samp>&rsquo; does not return
an error form, the combined error from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo; is used directly for
<!-- @math{\sigma_i}. -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sigma_i</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Finally, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo; is also stripped of its error
for use in computing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F(x,y,z)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">G(x,y,z)</span></samp>&rsquo; and so on;
the righthand side of the linearized model is computed in regular
arithmetic with no error forms.

   <p>(While these rules may seem complicated, they are designed to do
the most reasonable thing in the typical case that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Y(x,y,z)</span></samp>&rsquo;
depends only on the dependent variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo;, and in fact is
often simply equal to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For common cases like polynomials
and multilinear models, the combined error is simply used as the
<!-- @math{\sigma} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sigma</span></samp>&rsquo;
for the data point with no further ado.)

   <p><a name="index-FitRules-1811"></a>It may be the case that the model you wish to use is linearizable,
but Calc's built-in rules are unable to figure it out.  Calc uses
its algebraic rewrite mechanism to linearize a model.  The rewrite
rules are kept in the variable <code>FitRules</code>.  You can edit this
variable using the <kbd>s e FitRules</kbd> command; in fact, there is
a special <kbd>s F</kbd> command just for editing <code>FitRules</code>. 
See <a href="Operations-on-Variables.html#Operations-on-Variables">Operations on Variables</a>.

   <p>See <a href="Rewrite-Rules.html#Rewrite-Rules">Rewrite Rules</a>, for a discussion of rewrite rules.

   <p><a name="index-fitvar-1812"></a><a name="index-fitparam-1813"></a><a name="index-fitmodel-1814"></a><a name="index-fitsystem-1815"></a><a name="index-fitdummy-1816"></a>Calc uses <code>FitRules</code> as follows.  First, it converts the model
to an equation if necessary and encloses the model equation in a
call to the function <code>fitmodel</code> (which is not actually a defined
function in Calc; it is only used as a placeholder by the rewrite rules). 
Parameter variables are renamed to function calls &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitparam(1)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitparam(2)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on, and independent variables are renamed
to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitvar(1)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitvar(2)</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc.  The dependent variable
is the highest-numbered <code>fitvar</code>.  For example, the power law
model &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x^b</span></samp>&rsquo; is converted to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y = a x^b</span></samp>&rsquo;, then to

<pre class="smallexample">     fitmodel(fitvar(2) = fitparam(1) fitvar(1)^fitparam(2))
</pre>
   <p>Calc then applies the rewrites as if by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-u 0 a r FitRules</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(The zero prefix means that rewriting should continue until no further
changes are possible.)

   <p>When rewriting is complete, the <code>fitmodel</code> call should have
been replaced by a <code>fitsystem</code> call that looks like this:

<pre class="example">     fitsystem(<var>Y</var>, <var>FGH</var>, <var>abc</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>Y</var> is a formula that describes the function &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Y(x,y,z)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
<var>FGH</var> is the vector of formulas &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[F(x,y,z), G(x,y,z), H(x,y,z)]</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and <var>abc</var> is the vector of parameter filters which refer to the
raw parameters as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitdummy(1)</span></samp>&rsquo; for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitdummy(2)</span></samp>&rsquo;
for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc.  While the number of raw parameters (the length of
the <var>FGH</var> vector) is usually the same as the number of original
parameters (the length of the <var>abc</var> vector), this is not required.

   <p>The power law model eventually boils down to

<pre class="smallexample">     fitsystem(ln(fitvar(2)),
               [1, ln(fitvar(1))],
               [exp(fitdummy(1)), fitdummy(2)])
</pre>
   <p>The actual implementation of <code>FitRules</code> is complicated; it
proceeds in four phases.  First, common rearrangements are done
to try to bring linear terms together and to isolate functions like
<code>exp</code> and <code>ln</code> either all the way &ldquo;out&rdquo; (so that they
can be put into <var>Y</var>) or all the way &ldquo;in&rdquo; (so that they can
be put into <var>abc</var> or <var>FGH</var>).  In particular, all
non-constant powers are converted to logs-and-exponentials form,
and the distributive law is used to expand products of sums. 
Quotients are rewritten to use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitinv</span></samp>&rsquo; function, where
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitinv(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; represents &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/x</span></samp>&rsquo; while the <code>FitRules</code>
are operating.  (The use of <code>fitinv</code> makes recognition of
linear-looking forms easier.)  If you modify <code>FitRules</code>, you
will probably only need to modify the rules for this phase.

   <p>Phase two, whose rules can actually also apply during phases one
and three, first rewrites <code>fitmodel</code> to a two-argument
form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitmodel(</span><var>Y</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>model</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>Y</var> is
initially zero and <var>model</var> has been changed from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a=b</span></samp>&rsquo;
to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a-b</span></samp>&rsquo; form.  It then tries to peel off invertible functions
from the outside of <var>model</var> and put them into <var>Y</var> instead,
calling the equation solver to invert the functions.  Finally, when
this is no longer possible, the <code>fitmodel</code> is changed to a
four-argument <code>fitsystem</code>, where the fourth argument is
<var>model</var> and the <var>FGH</var> and <var>abc</var> vectors are initially
empty.  (The last vector is really <var>ABC</var>, corresponding to
raw parameters, for now.)

   <p>Phase three converts a sum of items in the <var>model</var> to a sum
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitpart(</span><var>a</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>b</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>c</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; terms which represent
terms &lsquo;<samp><var>a</var><span class="samp">*</span><var>b</var><span class="samp">*</span><var>c</var></samp>&rsquo; of the sum, where <var>a</var>
is all factors that do not involve any variables, <var>b</var> is all
factors that involve only parameters, and <var>c</var> is the factors
that involve only independent variables.  (If this decomposition
is not possible, the rule set will not complete and Calc will
complain that the model is too complex.)  Then <code>fitpart</code>s
with equal <var>b</var> or <var>c</var> components are merged back together
using the distributive law in order to minimize the number of
raw parameters needed.

   <p>Phase four moves the <code>fitpart</code> terms into the <var>FGH</var> and
<var>ABC</var> vectors.  Also, some of the algebraic expansions that
were done in phase 1 are undone now to make the formulas more
computationally efficient.  Finally, it calls the solver one more
time to convert the <var>ABC</var> vector to an <var>abc</var> vector, and
removes the fourth <var>model</var> argument (which by now will be zero)
to obtain the three-argument <code>fitsystem</code> that the linear
least-squares solver wants to see.

   <p><a name="index-hasfitparams-1817"></a><a name="index-hasfitvars-1818"></a>Two functions which are useful in connection with <code>FitRules</code>
are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hasfitparams(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hasfitvars(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, which check
whether &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; refers to any parameters or independent variables,
respectively.  Specifically, these functions return &ldquo;true&rdquo; if the
argument contains any <code>fitparam</code> (or <code>fitvar</code>) function
calls, and &ldquo;false&rdquo; otherwise.  (Recall that &ldquo;true&rdquo; means a
nonzero number, and &ldquo;false&rdquo; means zero.  The actual nonzero number
returned is the largest <var>n</var> from all the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitparam(</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;s
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fitvar(</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;s, respectively, that appear in the formula.)

   <p>The <code>fit</code> function in algebraic notation normally takes four
arguments, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fit(</span><var>model</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>vars</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>params</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>data</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
where <var>model</var> is the model formula as it would be typed after
<kbd>a F '</kbd>, <var>vars</var> is the independent variable or a vector of
independent variables, <var>params</var> likewise gives the parameter(s),
and <var>data</var> is the data matrix.  Note that the length of <var>vars</var>
must be equal to the number of rows in <var>data</var> if <var>model</var> is
an equation, or one less than the number of rows if <var>model</var> is
a plain formula.  (Actually, a name for the dependent variable is
allowed but will be ignored in the plain-formula case.)

   <p>If <var>params</var> is omitted, the parameters are all variables in
<var>model</var> except those that appear in <var>vars</var>.  If <var>vars</var>
is also omitted, Calc sorts all the variables that appear in
<var>model</var> alphabetically and uses the higher ones for <var>vars</var>
and the lower ones for <var>params</var>.

   <p>Alternatively, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fit(</span><var>modelvec</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>data</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; is allowed
where <var>modelvec</var> is a 2- or 3-vector describing the model
and variables, as discussed previously.

   <p>If Calc is unable to do the fit, the <code>fit</code> function is left
in symbolic form, ordinarily with an explanatory message.  The
message will be &ldquo;Model expression is too complex&rdquo; if the
linearizer was unable to put the model into the required form.

   <p>The <code>efit</code> (corresponding to <kbd>H a F</kbd>) and <code>xfit</code>
(for <kbd>I a F</kbd>) functions are completely analogous.
