<p class="noindent">He got an infinite loop.  First, Calc did as expected and rewrote
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;x</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(2, 3, x)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Then it looked for ways to
apply the rule again, and found that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(2, 3, x)</span></samp>&rsquo; looks like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b x</span></samp>&rsquo; with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b = 1</span></samp>&rsquo;, so it rewrote to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(0, 1, f(2, 3, x))</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It then wrapped another &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(0, 1, ...)</span></samp>&rsquo;
around that, and so on, ad infinitum.  Joe should have used <kbd>M-1 a r</kbd>
to make sure the rule applied only once.

   <p>(Actually, even the first step didn't work as he expected.  What Calc
really gives for <kbd>M-1 a r</kbd> in this situation is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(3 x, 1, 2)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
treating 2 as the &ldquo;variable,&rdquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3 x</span></samp>&rsquo; as a constant being added
to it.  While this may seem odd, it's just as valid a solution as the
&ldquo;obvious&rdquo; one.  One way to fix this would be to add the condition
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:: variable(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; to the rule, to make sure the thing that matches
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is indeed a variable, or to change &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">quote(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
on the lefthand side, so that the rule matches the actual variable
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; rather than letting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; stand for something else.)
