<h4 class="subsection">3.3.1 Vector Analysis</h4>

<p class="noindent">If you add two vectors, the result is a vector of the sums of the
elements, taken pairwise.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  [1, 2, 3]     2:  [1, 2, 3]     1:  [8, 8, 3]
         .             1:  [7, 6, 0]         .
                           .
     
         [1,2,3]  s 1      [7 6 0]  s 2      +
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that we can separate the vector elements with either commas or
spaces.  This is true whether we are using incomplete vectors or
algebraic entry.  The <kbd>s 1</kbd> and <kbd>s 2</kbd> commands save these
vectors so we can easily reuse them later.

   <p>If you multiply two vectors, the result is the sum of the products
of the elements taken pairwise.  This is called the <dfn>dot product</dfn>
of the vectors.

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  [1, 2, 3]     1:  19
     1:  [7, 6, 0]         .
         .
     
         r 1 r 2           *
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Dot-product-33"></a>The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their
lengths times the cosine of the angle between them.  (Here the vector
is interpreted as a line from the origin &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(0,0,0)</span></samp>&rsquo; to the
specified point in three-dimensional space.)  The <kbd>A</kbd>
(absolute value) command can be used to compute the length of a
vector.

<pre class="smallexample">     3:  19            3:  19          1:  0.550782    1:  56.579
     2:  [1, 2, 3]     2:  3.741657        .               .
     1:  [7, 6, 0]     1:  9.219544
         .                 .
     
         M-&lt;RET&gt;             M-2 A          * /             I C
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">First we recall the arguments to the dot product command, then
we compute the absolute values of the top two stack entries to
obtain the lengths of the vectors, then we divide the dot product
by the product of the lengths to get the cosine of the angle. 
The inverse cosine finds that the angle between the vectors
is about 56 degrees.

   <p><a name="index-Cross-product-34"></a><a name="index-Perpendicular-vectors-35"></a>The <dfn>cross product</dfn> of two vectors is a vector whose length
is the product of the lengths of the inputs times the sine of the
angle between them, and whose direction is perpendicular to both
input vectors.  Unlike the dot product, the cross product is
defined only for three-dimensional vectors.  Let's double-check
our computation of the angle using the cross product.

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  [1, 2, 3]  3:  [-18, 21, -8]  1:  [-0.52, 0.61, -0.23]  1:  56.579
     1:  [7, 6, 0]  2:  [1, 2, 3]          .                         .
         .          1:  [7, 6, 0]
                        .
     
         r 1 r 2        V C  s 3  M-&lt;RET&gt;    M-2 A * /                 A I S
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">First we recall the original vectors and compute their cross product,
which we also store for later reference.  Now we divide the vector
by the product of the lengths of the original vectors.  The length of
this vector should be the sine of the angle; sure enough, it is!

<!-- [fix-ref General Mode Commands] -->
   <p>Vector-related commands generally begin with the <kbd>v</kbd> prefix key. 
Some are uppercase letters and some are lowercase.  To make it easier
to type these commands, the shift-<kbd>V</kbd> prefix key acts the same as
the <kbd>v</kbd> key.  (See <a href="General-Mode-Commands.html#General-Mode-Commands">General Mode Commands</a>, for a way to make all
prefix keys have this property.)

   <p>If we take the dot product of two perpendicular vectors we expect
to get zero, since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero.  Let's check
that the cross product is indeed perpendicular to both inputs:

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  [1, 2, 3]      1:  0          2:  [7, 6, 0]      1:  0
     1:  [-18, 21, -8]      .          1:  [-18, 21, -8]      .
         .                                 .
     
         r 1 r 3            *          &lt;DEL&gt; r 2 r 3            *
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Normalizing-a-vector-36"></a><a name="index-Unit-vectors-37"></a>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong>  Given a vector on the top of the
stack, what keystrokes would you use to <dfn>normalize</dfn> the
vector, i.e., to reduce its length to one without changing its
direction?  See <a href="Vector-Answer-1.html#Vector-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)

   <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong>  Suppose a certain particle can be
at any of several positions along a ruler.  You have a list of
those positions in the form of a vector, and another list of the
probabilities for the particle to be at the corresponding positions. 
Find the average position of the particle.
