<h4 class="subsection">11.3.2 Algebraic Simplifications</h4>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-Algebraic-simplifications-1692"></a>The <kbd>a s</kbd> command makes simplifications that may be too slow to
do all the time, or that may not be desirable all of the time. 
If you find these simplifications are worthwhile, you can type
<kbd>m A</kbd> to have Calc apply them automatically.

   <p>This section describes all simplifications that are performed by
the <kbd>a s</kbd> command.  Note that these occur in addition to the
default simplifications; even if the default simplifications have
been turned off by an <kbd>m O</kbd> command, <kbd>a s</kbd> will turn them
back on temporarily while it simplifies the formula.

   <p>There is a variable, <code>AlgSimpRules</code>, in which you can put rewrites
to be applied by <kbd>a s</kbd>.  Its use is analogous to <code>EvalRules</code>,
but without the special restrictions.  Basically, the simplifier does
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a&nbsp;r<!-- /@w --> AlgSimpRules</span></samp>&rsquo; with an infinite repeat count on the whole
expression being simplified, then it traverses the expression applying
the built-in rules described below.  If the result is different from
the original expression, the process repeats with the default
simplifications (including <code>EvalRules</code>), then <code>AlgSimpRules</code>,
then the built-in simplifications, and so on.

   <p>Sums are simplified in two ways.  Constant terms are commuted to the
end of the sum, so that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + 2 + b</span></samp>&rsquo; changes to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b + 2</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The only exception is that a constant will not be commuted away
from the first position of a difference, i.e., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 - x</span></samp>&rsquo; is not
commuted to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x + 2</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Also, terms of sums are combined by the distributive law, as in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + y + 2 x</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y + 3 x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This always occurs for
adjacent terms, but <kbd>a s</kbd> compares all pairs of terms including
non-adjacent ones.

   <p>Products are sorted into a canonical order using the commutative
law.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b c a</span></samp>&rsquo; is commuted to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a b c</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
This allows easier comparison of products; for example, the default
simplifications will not change &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x y + y x</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x y</span></samp>&rsquo;,
but <kbd>a s</kbd> will; it first rewrites the sum to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x y + x y</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and then the default simplifications are able to recognize a sum
of identical terms.

   <p>The canonical ordering used to sort terms of products has the
property that real-valued numbers, interval forms and infinities
come first, and are sorted into increasing order.  The <kbd>V S</kbd>
command uses the same ordering when sorting a vector.

   <p>Sorting of terms of products is inhibited when Matrix mode is
turned on; in this case, Calc will never exchange the order of
two terms unless it knows at least one of the terms is a scalar.

   <p>Products of powers are distributed by comparing all pairs of
terms, using the same method that the default simplifications
use for adjacent terms of products.

   <p>Even though sums are not sorted, the commutative law is still
taken into account when terms of a product are being compared. 
Thus &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x + y) (y + x)</span></samp>&rsquo; will be simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x + y)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
A subtle point is that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x - y) (y - x)</span></samp>&rsquo; will <em>not</em>
be simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-(x - y)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;; Calc does not notice that
one term can be written as a constant times the other, even if
that constant is <i>-1</i>.

   <p>A fraction times any expression, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a:b) x</span></samp>&rsquo;, is changed to
a quotient involving integers:  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x / b</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is not
done for floating-point numbers like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0.5</span></samp>&rsquo;, however.  This
is one reason why you may find it convenient to turn Fraction mode
on while doing algebra; see <a href="Fraction-Mode.html#Fraction-Mode">Fraction Mode</a>.

   <p>Quotients are simplified by comparing all terms in the numerator
with all terms in the denominator for possible cancellation using
the distributive law.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x^2 b / c x^3 d</span></samp>&rsquo; will
cancel &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo; from the top and bottom to get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a b / c x d</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(The terms in the denominator will then be rearranged to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c d x</span></samp>&rsquo;
as described above.)  If there is any common integer or fractional
factor in the numerator and denominator, it is cancelled out;
for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(4 x + 6) / 8 x</span></samp>&rsquo; simplifies to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(2 x + 3) / 4 x</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Non-constant common factors are not found even by <kbd>a s</kbd>.  To
cancel the factor &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a x + a) / a^2</span></samp>&rsquo; you could first
use <kbd>j M</kbd> on the product &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x</span></samp>&rsquo; to Merge the numerator to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a (1+x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, which can then be simplified successfully.

   <p>Integer powers of the variable <code>i</code> are simplified according
to the identity &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i^2 = -1</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you store a new value other
than the complex number &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(0,1)</span></samp>&rsquo; in <code>i</code>, this simplification
will no longer occur.  This is done by <kbd>a s</kbd> instead of by default
in case someone (unwisely) uses the name <code>i</code> for a variable
unrelated to complex numbers; it would be unfortunate if Calc
quietly and automatically changed this formula for reasons the
user might not have been thinking of.

   <p>Square roots of integer or rational arguments are simplified in
several ways.  (Note that these will be left unevaluated only in
Symbolic mode.)  First, square integer or rational factors are
pulled out so that &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt><span class="samp">(8)</span></samp>&rsquo; is rewritten as
<!-- @math{2\,@tfn{sqrt}(2)}. -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 sqrt(2)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Conceptually speaking this implies factoring the argument into primes
and moving pairs of primes out of the square root, but for reasons of
efficiency Calc only looks for primes up to 29.

   <p>Square roots in the denominator of a quotient are moved to the
numerator:  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / </span><tt>sqrt</tt><span class="samp">(3)</span></samp>&rsquo; changes to &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt><span class="samp">(3) / 3</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The same effect occurs for the square root of a fraction:
&lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt><span class="samp">(2:3)</span></samp>&rsquo; changes to &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt><span class="samp">(6) / 3</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The <code>%</code> (modulo) operator is simplified in several ways
when the modulus &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo; is a positive real number.  First, if
the argument is of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + n</span></samp>&rsquo; for some real number
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; is itself reduced modulo &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For
example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x - 23) % 10</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x + 7) % 10</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If the argument is multiplied by a constant, and this constant
has a common integer divisor with the modulus, then this factor is
cancelled out.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">12 x % 15</span></samp>&rsquo; is changed to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3 (4 x % 5)</span></samp>&rsquo; by factoring out 3.  Also, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(12 x + 1) % 15</span></samp>&rsquo;
is changed to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3 ((4 x + 1:3) % 5)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  While these forms may
not seem &ldquo;simpler,&rdquo; they allow Calc to discover useful information
about modulo forms in the presence of declarations.

   <p>If the modulus is 1, then Calc can use <code>int</code> declarations to
evaluate the expression.  For example, the idiom &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x % 2</span></samp>&rsquo; is
often used to check whether a number is odd or even.  As described
above, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2&nbsp;n&nbsp;%&nbsp;2</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(2 n + 1) % 2</span></samp>&rsquo; are simplified to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 (n % 1)</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 ((n + 1:2) % 1)</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively; Calc
can simplify these to 0 and 1 (respectively) if <code>n</code> has been
declared to be an integer.

   <p>Trigonometric functions are simplified in several ways.  Whenever a
products of two trigonometric functions can be replaced by a single
function, the replacement is made; for example,
&lsquo;<samp><tt>tan</tt><span class="samp">(x) </span><tt>cos</tt><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to &lsquo;<samp><tt>sin</tt><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Reciprocals of trigonometric functions are replaced by their reciprocal
function; for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/</span><tt>sec</tt><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to
&lsquo;<samp><tt>cos</tt><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The corresponding simplifications for the
hyperbolic functions are also handled.

   <p>Trigonometric functions of their inverse functions are
simplified. The expression &lsquo;<samp><tt>sin</tt><span class="samp">(</span><tt>arcsin</tt><span class="samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; is
simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, and similarly for <code>cos</code> and <code>tan</code>. 
Trigonometric functions of inverses of different trigonometric
functions can also be simplified, as in &lsquo;<samp><tt>sin</tt><span class="samp">(</span><tt>arccos</tt><span class="samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;
to &lsquo;<samp><tt>sqrt</tt><span class="samp">(1 - x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If the argument to <code>sin</code> is negative-looking, it is simplified to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span><tt>sin</tt><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and similarly for <code>cos</code> and <code>tan</code>. 
Finally, certain special values of the argument are recognized;
see <a href="Trigonometric-and-Hyperbolic-Functions.html#Trigonometric-and-Hyperbolic-Functions">Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions</a>.

   <p>Hyperbolic functions of their inverses and of negative-looking
arguments are also handled, as are exponentials of inverse
hyperbolic functions.

   <p>No simplifications for inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic
functions are known, except for negative arguments of <code>arcsin</code>,
<code>arctan</code>, <code>arcsinh</code>, and <code>arctanh</code>.  Note that
&lsquo;<samp><tt>arcsin</tt><span class="samp">(</span><tt>sin</tt><span class="samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; can <em>not</em> safely change to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, since this only correct within an integer multiple of
<!-- @math{2 \pi} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 pi</span></samp>&rsquo;
radians or 360 degrees.  However, &lsquo;<samp><tt>arcsinh</tt><span class="samp">(</span><tt>sinh</tt><span class="samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo; is
simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is known to be real.

   <p>Several simplifications that apply to logarithms and exponentials
are that &lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt><span class="samp">(</span><tt>ln</tt><span class="samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;,
<!-- @tfn{e}@math{^{\ln(x)}}, -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e^</span><tt>ln</tt><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and
<!-- @math{10^{{\rm log10}(x)}} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10^</span><tt>log10</tt><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
all reduce to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Also, &lsquo;<samp><tt>ln</tt><span class="samp">(</span><tt>exp</tt><span class="samp">(x))</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc., can
reduce to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is provably real.  The form
&lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt><span class="samp">(x)^y</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to &lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt><span class="samp">(x y)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;
is a suitable multiple of
<!-- @math{\pi i} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pi i</span></samp>&rsquo;
(as described above for the trigonometric functions), then
&lsquo;<samp><tt>exp</tt><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e^x</span></samp>&rsquo; will be expanded.  Finally,
&lsquo;<samp><tt>ln</tt><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to a form involving <code>pi</code> and
<code>i</code> where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is provably negative, positive imaginary, or
negative imaginary.

   <p>The error functions <code>erf</code> and <code>erfc</code> are simplified when
their arguments are negative-looking or are calls to the <code>conj</code>
function.

   <p>Equations and inequalities are simplified by cancelling factors
of products, quotients, or sums on both sides.  Inequalities
change sign if a negative multiplicative factor is cancelled. 
Non-constant multiplicative factors as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a b = a c</span></samp>&rsquo; are
cancelled from equations only if they are provably nonzero (generally
because they were declared so; see <a href="Declarations.html#Declarations">Declarations</a>).  Factors
are cancelled from inequalities only if they are nonzero and their
sign is known.

   <p>Simplification also replaces an equation or inequality with
1 or 0 (&ldquo;true&rdquo; or &ldquo;false&rdquo;) if it can through the use of
declarations.  If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is declared to be an integer greater
than 5, then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x &lt; 3</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x = 3</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x = 7.5</span></samp>&rsquo; are
all simplified to 0, but &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x &gt; 3</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to 1. 
By a similar analysis, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">abs(x) &gt;= 0</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to 1,
as is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2 &gt;= 0</span></samp>&rsquo; if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is known to be real.
