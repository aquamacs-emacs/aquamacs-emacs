<h4 class="subsection">8.5.3 Business Days</h4>

<p class="noindent">Often time is measured in &ldquo;business days&rdquo; or &ldquo;working days,&rdquo;
where weekends and holidays are skipped.  Calc's normal date
arithmetic functions use calendar days, so that subtracting two
consecutive Mondays will yield a difference of 7 days.  By contrast,
subtracting two consecutive Mondays would yield 5 business days
(assuming two-day weekends and the absence of holidays).

   <p><a name="index-t-_002b-840"></a><a name="index-t-_002d-841"></a><a name="index-badd-842"></a><a name="index-bsub-843"></a><a name="index-calc_002dbusiness_002ddays_002dplus-844"></a><a name="index-calc_002dbusiness_002ddays_002dminus-845"></a>The <kbd>t +</kbd> (<code>calc-business-days-plus</code>) [<code>badd</code>]
and <kbd>t -</kbd> (<code>calc-business-days-minus</code>) [<code>bsub</code>]
commands perform arithmetic using business days.  For <kbd>t +</kbd>,
one argument must be a date form and the other must be a real
number (positive or negative).  If the number is not an integer,
then a certain amount of time is added as well as a number of
days; for example, adding 0.5 business days to a time in Friday
evening will produce a time in Monday morning.  It is also
possible to add an HMS form; adding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">12@ 0' 0"</span></samp>&rsquo; also adds
half a business day.  For <kbd>t -</kbd>, the arguments are either a
date form and a number or HMS form, or two date forms, in which
case the result is the number of business days between the two
dates.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bHolidays_007d-variable-846"></a><a name="index-Holidays-847"></a>By default, Calc considers any day that is not a Saturday or
Sunday to be a business day.  You can define any number of
additional holidays by editing the variable <code>Holidays</code>. 
(There is an <kbd>s&nbsp;H</kbd><!-- /@w --> convenience command for editing this
variable.)  Initially, <code>Holidays</code> contains the vector
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[sat, sun]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Entries in the <code>Holidays</code> vector may
be any of the following kinds of objects:

     <ul>
<li>Date forms (pure dates, not date/time forms).  These specify
particular days which are to be treated as holidays.

     <li>Intervals of date forms.  These specify a range of days, all of
which are holidays (e.g., Christmas week).  See <a href="Interval-Forms.html#Interval-Forms">Interval Forms</a>.

     <li>Nested vectors of date forms.  Each date form in the vector is
considered to be a holiday.

     <li>Any Calc formula which evaluates to one of the above three things. 
If the formula involves the variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;, it stands for a
yearly repeating holiday; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; will take on various year
numbers like 1992.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">date(y, 12, 25)</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies
Christmas day, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">newweek(date(y, 11, 7), 4) + 21</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies
Thanksgiving (which is held on the fourth Thursday of November). 
If the formula involves the variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo;, that variable
takes on month numbers from 1 to 12:  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">date(y, m, 15)</span></samp>&rsquo; is
a holiday that takes place on the 15th of every month.

     <li>A weekday name, such as <code>sat</code> or <code>sun</code>.  This is really
a variable whose name is a three-letter, lower-case day name.

     <li>An interval of year numbers (integers).  This specifies the span of
years over which this holiday list is to be considered valid.  Any
business-day arithmetic that goes outside this range will result
in an error message.  Use this if you are including an explicit
list of holidays, rather than a formula to generate them, and you
want to make sure you don't accidentally go beyond the last point
where the holidays you entered are complete.  If there is no
limiting interval in the <code>Holidays</code> vector, the default
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1 .. 2737]</span></samp>&rsquo; is used.  (This is the absolute range of years
for which Calc's business-day algorithms will operate.)

     <li>An interval of HMS forms.  This specifies the span of hours that
are to be considered one business day.  For example, if this
range is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[9@ 0' 0" .. 17@ 0' 0"]</span></samp>&rsquo; (i.e., 9am to 5pm), then
the business day is only eight hours long, so that <kbd>1.5 t +</kbd>
on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;4:00pm Fri Dec 13, 1991&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; will add one business day and
four business hours to produce &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;12:00pm Tue Dec 17, 1991&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Likewise, <kbd>t -</kbd> will now express differences in time as
fractions of an eight-hour day.  Times before 9am will be treated
as 9am by business date arithmetic, and times at or after 5pm will
be treated as 4:59:59pm.  If there is no HMS interval in <code>Holidays</code>,
the full 24-hour day &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0 0' 0" .. 24 0' 0"]</span></samp>&rsquo; is assumed. 
(Regardless of the type of bounds you specify, the interval is
treated as inclusive on the low end and exclusive on the high end,
so that the work day goes from 9am up to, but not including, 5pm.) 
</ul>

   <p>If the <code>Holidays</code> vector is empty, then <kbd>t +</kbd> and
<kbd>t -</kbd> will act just like <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> because there will
then be no difference between business days and calendar days.

   <p>Calc expands the intervals and formulas you give into a complete
list of holidays for internal use.  This is done mainly to make
sure it can detect multiple holidays.  (For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;Jan 1, 1989&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; is both New Year's Day and a Sunday, but
Calc's algorithms take care to count it only once when figuring
the number of holidays between two dates.)

   <p>Since the complete list of holidays for all the years from 1 to
2737 would be huge, Calc actually computes only the part of the
list between the smallest and largest years that have been involved
in business-day calculations so far.  Normally, you won't have to
worry about this.  Keep in mind, however, that if you do one
calculation for 1992, and another for 1792, even if both involve
only a small range of years, Calc will still work out all the
holidays that fall in that 200-year span.

   <p>If you add a (positive) number of days to a date form that falls on a
weekend or holiday, the date form is treated as if it were the most
recent business day.  (Thus adding one business day to a Friday,
Saturday, or Sunday will all yield the following Monday.)  If you
subtract a number of days from a weekend or holiday, the date is
effectively on the following business day.  (So subtracting one business
day from Saturday, Sunday, or Monday yields the preceding Friday.)  The
difference between two dates one or both of which fall on holidays
equals the number of actual business days between them.  These
conventions are consistent in the sense that, if you add <var>n</var>
business days to any date, the difference between the result and the
original date will come out to <var>n</var> business days.  (It can't be
completely consistent though; a subtraction followed by an addition
might come out a bit differently, since <kbd>t +</kbd> is incapable of
producing a date that falls on a weekend or holiday.)

   <p><a name="index-holiday-848"></a>There is a <code>holiday</code> function, not on any keys, that takes
any date form and returns 1 if that date falls on a weekend or
holiday, as defined in <code>Holidays</code>, or 0 if the date is a
business day.
