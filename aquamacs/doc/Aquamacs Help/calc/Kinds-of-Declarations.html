<h4 class="subsection">7.6.2 Kinds of Declarations</h4>

<p class="noindent">The type-specifier part of a declaration (that is, the second prompt
in the <kbd>s d</kbd> command) can be a type symbol, an interval, or a
vector consisting of zero or more type symbols followed by zero or
more intervals or numbers that represent the set of possible values
for the variable.

<pre class="smallexample">     [ [ a, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ]
       [ b, [1 .. 5]        ]
       [ c, [int, 1 .. 5]   ] ]
</pre>
   <p>Here <code>a</code> is declared to contain one of the five integers shown;
<code>b</code> is any number in the interval from 1 to 5 (any real number
since we haven't specified), and <code>c</code> is any integer in that
interval.  Thus the declarations for <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> are
nearly equivalent (see below).

   <p>The type-specifier can be the empty vector &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo; to say that
nothing is known about a given variable's value.  This is the same
as not declaring the variable at all except that it overrides any
<code>All</code> declaration which would otherwise apply.

   <p>The initial value of <code>Decls</code> is the empty vector &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If <code>Decls</code> has no stored value or if the value stored in it
is not valid, it is ignored and there are no declarations as far
as Calc is concerned.  (The <kbd>s d</kbd> command will replace such a
malformed value with a fresh empty matrix, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo;, before recording
the new declaration.)  Unrecognized type symbols are ignored.

   <p>The following type symbols describe what sorts of numbers will be
stored in a variable:

     <dl>
<dt><code>int</code><dd>Integers. 
<br><dt><code>numint</code><dd>Numerical integers.  (Integers or integer-valued floats.) 
<br><dt><code>frac</code><dd>Fractions.  (Rational numbers which are not integers.) 
<br><dt><code>rat</code><dd>Rational numbers.  (Either integers or fractions.) 
<br><dt><code>float</code><dd>Floating-point numbers. 
<br><dt><code>real</code><dd>Real numbers.  (Integers, fractions, or floats.  Actually,
intervals and error forms with real components also count as
reals here.) 
<br><dt><code>pos</code><dd>Positive real numbers.  (Strictly greater than zero.) 
<br><dt><code>nonneg</code><dd>Nonnegative real numbers.  (Greater than or equal to zero.) 
<br><dt><code>number</code><dd>Numbers.  (Real or complex.) 
</dl>

   <p>Calc uses this information to determine when certain simplifications
of formulas are safe.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x^y)^z</span></samp>&rsquo; cannot be
simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^(y z)</span></samp>&rsquo; in general; for example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">((-3)^2)^1:2</span></samp>&rsquo; is 3, but &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(-3)^(2*1:2) = (-3)^1</span></samp>&rsquo; is <i>-3</i>. 
However, this simplification <em>is</em> safe if <code>z</code> is known
to be an integer, or if <code>x</code> is known to be a nonnegative
real number.  If you have given declarations that allow Calc to
deduce either of these facts, Calc will perform this simplification
of the formula.

   <p>Calc can apply a certain amount of logic when using declarations. 
For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x^y)^(2n+1)</span></samp>&rsquo; will be simplified if <code>n</code>
has been declared <code>int</code>; Calc knows that an integer times an
integer, plus an integer, must always be an integer.  (In fact,
Calc would simplify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(-x)^(2n+1)</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-(x^(2n+1))</span></samp>&rsquo; since
it is able to determine that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2n+1</span></samp>&rsquo; must be an odd integer.)

   <p>Similarly, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(abs(x)^y)^z</span></samp>&rsquo; will be simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">abs(x)^(y z)</span></samp>&rsquo;
because Calc knows that the <code>abs</code> function always returns a
nonnegative real.  If you had a <code>myabs</code> function that also had
this property, you could get Calc to recognize it by adding the row
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[myabs(), nonneg]</span></samp>&rsquo; to the <code>Decls</code> matrix.

   <p>One instance of this simplification is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo; (since the
<code>sqrt</code> function is effectively a one-half power).  Normally
Calc leaves this formula alone.  After the command
<kbd>s d x &lt;RET&gt; real &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, however, it can simplify the formula to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">abs(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  And after <kbd>s d x &lt;RET&gt; nonneg &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, Calc can
simplify this formula all the way to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If there are any intervals or real numbers in the type specifier,
they comprise the set of possible values that the variable or
function being declared can have.  In particular, the type symbol
<code>real</code> is effectively the same as the range &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[-inf .. inf]</span></samp>&rsquo;
(note that infinity is included in the range of possible values);
<code>pos</code> is the same as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(0 .. inf]</span></samp>&rsquo;, and <code>nonneg</code> is
the same as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0 .. inf]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Saying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[real, [-5 .. 5]]</span></samp>&rsquo; is
redundant because the fact that the variable is real can be
deduced just from the interval, but &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[int, [-5 .. 5]]</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[rat, [-5 .. 5]]</span></samp>&rsquo; are useful combinations.

   <p>Note that the vector of intervals or numbers is in the same format
used by Calc's set-manipulation commands.  See <a href="Set-Operations.html#Set-Operations">Set Operations</a>.

   <p>The type specifier &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1, 2, 3]</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[numint, 1, 2, 3]</span></samp>&rsquo;, <em>not</em> to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[int, 1, 2, 3]</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
In other words, the range of possible values means only that
the variable's value must be numerically equal to a number in
that range, but not that it must be equal in type as well. 
Calc's set operations act the same way; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">in(2, [1., 2., 3.])</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">in(1.5, [1:2, 3:2, 5:2])</span></samp>&rsquo; both report &ldquo;true.&rdquo;

   <p>If you use a conflicting combination of type specifiers, the
results are unpredictable.  An example is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[pos, [0 .. 5]]</span></samp>&rsquo;,
where the interval does not lie in the range described by the
type symbol.

   <p>&ldquo;Real&rdquo; declarations mostly affect simplifications involving powers
like the one described above.  Another case where they are used
is in the <kbd>a P</kbd> command which returns a list of all roots of a
polynomial; if the variable has been declared real, only the real
roots (if any) will be included in the list.

   <p>&ldquo;Integer&rdquo; declarations are used for simplifications which are valid
only when certain values are integers (such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x^y)^z</span></samp>&rsquo;
shown above).

   <p>Another command that makes use of declarations is <kbd>a s</kbd>, when
simplifying equations and inequalities.  It will cancel <code>x</code>
from both sides of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x = b x</span></samp>&rsquo; only if it is sure <code>x</code>
is non-zero, say, because it has a <code>pos</code> declaration. 
To declare specifically that <code>x</code> is real and non-zero,
use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[-inf .. 0), (0 .. inf]]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (There is no way in the
current notation to say that <code>x</code> is nonzero but not necessarily
real.)  The <kbd>a e</kbd> command does &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; simplifications,
including cancelling &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; from the equation when &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is
not known to be nonzero.

   <p>Another set of type symbols distinguish between scalars and vectors.

     <dl>
<dt><code>scalar</code><dd>The value is not a vector. 
<br><dt><code>vector</code><dd>The value is a vector. 
<br><dt><code>matrix</code><dd>The value is a matrix (a rectangular vector of vectors). 
<br><dt><code>sqmatrix</code><dd>The value is a square matrix. 
</dl>

   <p>These type symbols can be combined with the other type symbols
described above; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[int, matrix]</span></samp>&rsquo; describes an object which
is a matrix of integers.

   <p>Scalar/vector declarations are used to determine whether certain
algebraic operations are safe.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a, b, c] + x</span></samp>&rsquo;
is normally not simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a + x, b + x, c + x]</span></samp>&rsquo;, but
it will be if <code>x</code> has been declared <code>scalar</code>.  On the
other hand, multiplication is usually assumed to be commutative,
but the terms in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x y</span></samp>&rsquo; will never be exchanged if both <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code> are known to be vectors or matrices.  (Calc currently
never distinguishes between <code>vector</code> and <code>matrix</code>
declarations.)

   <p>See <a href="Matrix-Mode.html#Matrix-Mode">Matrix Mode</a>, for a discussion of Matrix mode and
Scalar mode, which are similar to declaring &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[All, matrix]</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[All, scalar]</span></samp>&rsquo; but much more convenient.

   <p>One more type symbol that is recognized is used with the <kbd>H a d</kbd>
command for taking total derivatives of a formula.  See <a href="Calculus.html#Calculus">Calculus</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>const</code><dd>The value is a constant with respect to other variables. 
</dl>

   <p>Calc does not check the declarations for a variable when you store
a value in it.  However, storing <i>-3.5</i> in a variable that has
been declared <code>pos</code>, <code>int</code>, or <code>matrix</code> may have
unexpected effects; Calc may evaluate &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3.5</span></samp>&rsquo;
if it substitutes the value first, or to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-3.5</span></samp>&rsquo; if <code>x</code>
was declared <code>pos</code> and the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo; is
simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; before the value is substituted.  Before
using a variable for a new purpose, it is best to use <kbd>s d</kbd>
or <kbd>s D</kbd> to check to make sure you don't still have an old
declaration for the variable that will conflict with its new meaning.
