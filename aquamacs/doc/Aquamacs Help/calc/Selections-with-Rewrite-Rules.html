<h4 class="subsection">11.11.9 Selections with Rewrite Rules</h4>

<p class="noindent">If a sub-formula of the current formula is selected (as by <kbd>j s</kbd>;
see <a href="Selecting-Subformulas.html#Selecting-Subformulas">Selecting Subformulas</a>), the <kbd>a r</kbd> (<code>calc-rewrite</code>)
command applies only to that sub-formula.  Together with a negative
prefix argument, you can use this fact to apply a rewrite to one
specific part of a formula without affecting any other parts.

   <p><a name="index-j-r-1937"></a><a name="index-calc_002drewrite_002dselection-1938"></a>The <kbd>j r</kbd> (<code>calc-rewrite-selection</code>) command allows more
sophisticated operations on selections.  This command prompts for
the rules in the same way as <kbd>a r</kbd>, but it then applies those
rules to the whole formula in question even though a sub-formula
of it has been selected.  However, the selected sub-formula will
first have been surrounded by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select( )</span></samp>&rsquo; function call. 
(Calc's evaluator does not understand the function name <code>select</code>;
this is only a tag used by the <kbd>j r</kbd> command.)

   <p>For example, suppose the formula on the stack is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 (a + b)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;
and the sub-formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b</span></samp>&rsquo; is selected.  This formula will
be rewritten to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 select(a + b)^2</span></samp>&rsquo; and then the rewrite
rules will be applied in the usual way.  The rewrite rules can
include references to <code>select</code> to tell where in the pattern
the selected sub-formula should appear.

   <p>If there is still exactly one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select( )</span></samp>&rsquo; function call in
the formula after rewriting is done, it indicates which part of
the formula should be selected afterwards.  Otherwise, the
formula will be unselected.

   <p>You can make <kbd>j r</kbd> act much like <kbd>a r</kbd> by enclosing both parts
of the rewrite rule with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select()</span></samp>&rsquo;.  However, <kbd>j r</kbd>
allows you to use the current selection in more flexible ways. 
Suppose you wished to make a rule which removed the exponent from
the selected term; the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select(a)^x := select(a)</span></samp>&rsquo; would
work.  In the above example, it would rewrite &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 select(a + b)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;
to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 select(a + b)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This would then be returned to the
stack as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 (a + b)</span></samp>&rsquo; with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b</span></samp>&rsquo; selected.

   <p>The <kbd>j r</kbd> command uses one iteration by default, unlike
<kbd>a r</kbd> which defaults to 100 iterations.  A numeric prefix
argument affects <kbd>j r</kbd> in the same way as <kbd>a r</kbd>. 
See <a href="Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules.html#Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules">Nested Formulas with Rewrite Rules</a>.

   <p>As with other selection commands, <kbd>j r</kbd> operates on the stack
entry that contains the cursor.  (If the cursor is on the top-of-stack
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; marker, it works as if the cursor were on the formula
at stack level 1.)

   <p>If you don't specify a set of rules, the rules are taken from the
top of the stack, just as with <kbd>a r</kbd>.  In this case, the
cursor must indicate stack entry 2 or above as the formula to be
rewritten (otherwise the same formula would be used as both the
target and the rewrite rules).

   <p>If the indicated formula has no selection, the cursor position within
the formula temporarily selects a sub-formula for the purposes of this
command.  If the cursor is not on any sub-formula (e.g., it is in
the line-number area to the left of the formula), the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select( )</span></samp>&rsquo;
markers are ignored by the rewrite mechanism and the rules are allowed
to apply anywhere in the formula.

   <p>As a special feature, the normal <kbd>a r</kbd> command also ignores
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select( )</span></samp>&rsquo; calls in rewrite rules.  For example, if you used the
above rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select(a)^x := select(a)</span></samp>&rsquo; with <kbd>a r</kbd>, it would apply
the rule as if it were &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a^x := a</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Thus, you can write general
purpose rules with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">select( )</span></samp>&rsquo; hints inside them so that they
will &ldquo;do the right thing&rdquo; in both <kbd>a r</kbd> and <kbd>j r</kbd>,
both with and without selections.
