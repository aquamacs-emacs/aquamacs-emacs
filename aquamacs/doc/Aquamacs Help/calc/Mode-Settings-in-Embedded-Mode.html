<h3 class="section">17.4 Mode Settings in Embedded Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-m-e-2240"></a><a name="index-calc_002dembedded_002dpreserve_002dmodes-2241"></a>The mode settings can be changed while Calc is in embedded mode, but
by default they will revert to their original values when embedded mode
is ended. However, the modes saved when the mode-recording mode is
<code>Save</code> (see below) and the modes in effect when the <kbd>m e</kbd>
(<code>calc-embedded-preserve-modes</code>) command is given
will be preserved when embedded mode is ended.

   <p>Embedded mode has a rather complicated mechanism for handling mode
settings in Embedded formulas.  It is possible to put annotations
in the file that specify mode settings either global to the entire
file or local to a particular formula or formulas.  In the latter
case, different modes can be specified for use when a formula
is the enabled Embedded mode formula.

   <p>When you give any mode-setting command, like <kbd>m f</kbd> (for Fraction
mode) or <kbd>d s</kbd> (for scientific notation), Embedded mode adds
a line like the following one to the file just before the opening
delimiter of the formula.

<pre class="example">     % [calc-mode: fractions: t]
     % [calc-mode: float-format: (sci 0)]
</pre>
   <p>When Calc interprets an embedded formula, it scans the text before
the formula for mode-setting annotations like these and sets the
Calc buffer to match these modes.  Modes not explicitly described
in the file are not changed.  Calc scans all the way to the top of
the file, or up to a line of the form

<pre class="example">     % [calc-defaults]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which you can insert at strategic places in the file if this backward
scan is getting too slow, or just to provide a barrier between one
&ldquo;zone&rdquo; of mode settings and another.

   <p>If the file contains several annotations for the same mode, the
closest one before the formula is used.  Annotations after the
formula are never used (except for global annotations, described
below).

   <p>The scan does not look for the leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">% </span></samp>&rsquo;, only for the
square brackets and the text they enclose.  In fact, the leading
characters are different for different major modes.  You can edit the
mode annotations to a style that works better in context if you wish. 
See <a href="Customizing-Embedded-Mode.html#Customizing-Embedded-Mode">Customizing Embedded Mode</a>, to see how to change the style
that Calc uses when it generates the annotations.  You can write
mode annotations into the file yourself if you know the syntax;
the easiest way to find the syntax for a given mode is to let
Calc write the annotation for it once and see what it does.

   <p>If you give a mode-changing command for a mode that already has
a suitable annotation just above the current formula, Calc will
modify that annotation rather than generating a new, conflicting
one.

   <p>Mode annotations have three parts, separated by colons.  (Spaces
after the colons are optional.)  The first identifies the kind
of mode setting, the second is a name for the mode itself, and
the third is the value in the form of a Lisp symbol, number,
or list.  Annotations with unrecognizable text in the first or
second parts are ignored.  The third part is not checked to make
sure the value is of a valid type or range; if you write an
annotation by hand, be sure to give a proper value or results
will be unpredictable.  Mode-setting annotations are case-sensitive.

   <p>While Embedded mode is enabled, the word <code>Local</code> appears in
the mode line.  This is to show that mode setting commands generate
annotations that are &ldquo;local&rdquo; to the current formula or set of
formulas.  The <kbd>m R</kbd> (<code>calc-mode-record-mode</code>) command
causes Calc to generate different kinds of annotations.  Pressing
<kbd>m R</kbd> repeatedly cycles through the possible modes.

   <p><code>LocEdit</code> and <code>LocPerm</code> modes generate annotations
that look like this, respectively:

<pre class="example">     % [calc-edit-mode: float-format: (sci 0)]
     % [calc-perm-mode: float-format: (sci 5)]
</pre>
   <p>The first kind of annotation will be used only while a formula
is enabled in Embedded mode.  The second kind will be used only
when the formula is <em>not</em> enabled.  (Whether the formula
is &ldquo;active&rdquo; or not, i.e., whether Calc has seen this formula
yet, is not relevant here.)

   <p><code>Global</code> mode generates an annotation like this at the end
of the file:

<pre class="example">     % [calc-global-mode: fractions t]
</pre>
   <p>Global mode annotations affect all formulas throughout the file,
and may appear anywhere in the file.  This allows you to tuck your
mode annotations somewhere out of the way, say, on a new page of
the file, as long as those mode settings are suitable for all
formulas in the file.

   <p>Enabling a formula with <kbd>C-x * e</kbd> causes a fresh scan for local
mode annotations; you will have to use this after adding annotations
above a formula by hand to get the formula to notice them.  Updating
a formula with <kbd>C-x * u</kbd> will also re-scan the local modes, but
global modes are only re-scanned by <kbd>C-x * a</kbd>.

   <p>Another way that modes can get out of date is if you add a local
mode annotation to a formula that has another formula after it. 
In this example, we have used the <kbd>d s</kbd> command while the
first of the two embedded formulas is active.  But the second
formula has not changed its style to match, even though by the
rules of reading annotations the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(sci 0)</span></samp>&rsquo; applies to it, too.

<pre class="example">     % [calc-mode: float-format: (sci 0)]
     1.23e2
     
     456.
</pre>
   <p>We would have to go down to the other formula and press <kbd>C-x * u</kbd>
on it in order to get it to notice the new annotation.

   <p>Two more mode-recording modes selectable by <kbd>m R</kbd> are available
which are also available outside of Embedded mode. 
(see <a href="General-Mode-Commands.html#General-Mode-Commands">General Mode Commands</a>.) They are <code>Save</code>,  in which mode
settings are recorded permanently in your Calc init file (the file given
by the variable <code>calc-settings-file</code>, typically <samp><span class="file">~/.calc.el</span></samp>)
rather than by annotating the current document, and no-recording
mode (where there is no symbol like <code>Save</code> or <code>Local</code> in
the mode line), in which mode-changing commands do not leave any
annotations at all.

   <p>When Embedded mode is not enabled, mode-recording modes except
for <code>Save</code> have no effect.
