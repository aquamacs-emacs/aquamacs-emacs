<h3 class="section">3.6 Programming Tutorial</h3>

<p class="noindent">The Calculator is written entirely in Emacs Lisp, a highly extensible
language.  If you know Lisp, you can program the Calculator to do
anything you like.  Rewrite rules also work as a powerful programming
system.  But Lisp and rewrite rules take a while to master, and often
all you want to do is define a new function or repeat a command a few
times.  Calc has features that allow you to do these things easily.

   <p>One very limited form of programming is defining your own functions. 
Calc's <kbd>Z F</kbd> command allows you to define a function name and
key sequence to correspond to any formula.  Programming commands use
the shift-<kbd>Z</kbd> prefix; the user commands they create use the lower
case <kbd>z</kbd> prefix.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  1 + x + x^2 / 2 + x^3 / 6         1:  1 + x + x^2 / 2 + x^3 / 6
         .                                     .
     
         ' 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! &lt;RET&gt;         Z F e myexp &lt;RET&gt; &lt;RET&gt; &lt;RET&gt; y
</pre>
   <p>This polynomial is a Taylor series approximation to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The <kbd>Z F</kbd> command asks a number of questions.  The above answers
say that the key sequence for our function should be <kbd>z e</kbd>; the
<kbd>M-x</kbd> equivalent should be <code>calc-myexp</code>; the name of the
function in algebraic formulas should also be <code>myexp</code>; the
default argument list &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x)</span></samp>&rsquo; is acceptable; and finally <kbd>y</kbd>
answers the question &ldquo;leave it in symbolic form for non-constant
arguments?&rdquo;

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  1.3495     2:  1.3495     3:  1.3495
         .          1:  1.34986    2:  1.34986
                        .          1:  myexp(a + 1)
                                       .
     
         .3 z e         .3 E           ' a+1 &lt;RET&gt; z e
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">First we call our new <code>exp</code> approximation with 0.3 as an
argument, and compare it with the true <code>exp</code> function.  Then
we note that, as requested, if we try to give <kbd>z e</kbd> an
argument that isn't a plain number, it leaves the <code>myexp</code>
function call in symbolic form.  If we had answered <kbd>n</kbd> to the
final question, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myexp(a + 1)</span></samp>&rsquo; would have evaluated by plugging
in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + 1</span></samp>&rsquo; for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; in the defining formula.

   <p><a name="index-Sine-integral-Si_0028x_0029-71"></a><a name="index-Si-72"></a>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong>  The &ldquo;sine integral&rdquo; function
<!-- @math{{\rm Si}(x)} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Si(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
is defined as the integral of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(t)/t</span></samp>&rsquo; for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t = 0</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; in radians.  (It was invented because this
integral has no solution in terms of basic functions; if you give it
to Calc's <kbd>a i</kbd> command, it will ponder it for a long time and then
give up.)  We can use the numerical integration command, however,
which in algebraic notation is written like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ninteg(f(t), t, 0, x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
with any integrand &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(t)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Define a <kbd>z s</kbd> command and
<code>Si</code> function that implement this.  You will need to edit the
default argument list a bit.  As a test, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Si(1)</span></samp>&rsquo; should return
0.946083. (If you don't get this answer, you might want to check that
Calc is in Radians mode.  Also, <code>ninteg</code> will run a lot faster if
you reduce the precision to, say, six digits beforehand.) 
See <a href="Programming-Answer-1.html#Programming-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)

   <p>The simplest way to do real &ldquo;programming&rdquo; of Emacs is to define a
<dfn>keyboard macro</dfn>.  A keyboard macro is simply a sequence of
keystrokes which Emacs has stored away and can play back on demand. 
For example, if you find yourself typing <kbd>H a S x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> often,
you may wish to program a keyboard macro to type this for you.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  y = sqrt(x)          1:  x = y^2
         .                        .
     
         ' y=sqrt(x) &lt;RET&gt;       C-x ( H a S x &lt;RET&gt; C-x )
     
     1:  y = cos(x)           1:  x = s1 arccos(y) + 2 pi n1
         .                        .
     
         ' y=cos(x) &lt;RET&gt;           X
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When you type <kbd>C-x (</kbd>, Emacs begins recording.  But it is also
still ready to execute your keystrokes, so you're really &ldquo;training&rdquo;
Emacs by walking it through the procedure once.  When you type
<kbd>C-x&nbsp;)</kbd><!-- /@w -->, the macro is recorded.  You can now type <kbd>X</kbd> to
re-execute the same keystrokes.

   <p>You can give a name to your macro by typing <kbd>Z K</kbd>.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  .              1:  y = x^4         1:  x = s2 sqrt(s1 sqrt(y))
                            .                   .
     
       Z K x &lt;RET&gt;            ' y=x^4 &lt;RET&gt;         z x
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Notice that we use shift-<kbd>Z</kbd> to define the command, and lower-case
<kbd>z</kbd> to call it up.

   <p>Keyboard macros can call other macros.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  abs(x)        1:  x = s1 y                1:  2 / x    1:  x = 2 / y
         .                 .                           .            .
     
      ' abs(x) &lt;RET&gt;   C-x ( ' y &lt;RET&gt; a = z x C-x )    ' 2/x &lt;RET&gt;       X
</pre>
   <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong>  Define a keyboard macro to negate
the item in level 3 of the stack, without disturbing the rest of
the stack.  See <a href="Programming-Answer-2.html#Programming-Answer-2">2</a>. (&bull;)

   <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong>  Define keyboard macros to compute
the following functions:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Compute
<!-- @math{\displaystyle{\sin x \over x}}, -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x) / x</span></samp>&rsquo;,
where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is the number on the top of the stack.

     <li>Compute the base-&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; logarithm, just like the <kbd>B</kbd> key except
the arguments are taken in the opposite order.

     <li>Produce a vector of integers from 1 to the integer on the top of
the stack.
        </ol>
See <a href="Programming-Answer-3.html#Programming-Answer-3">3</a>. (&bull;)

   <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 4.</strong>  Define a keyboard macro to compute
the average (mean) value of a list of numbers. 
See <a href="Programming-Answer-4.html#Programming-Answer-4">4</a>. (&bull;)

   <p>In many programs, some of the steps must execute several times. 
Calc has <dfn>looping</dfn> commands that allow this.  Loops are useful
inside keyboard macros, but actually work at any time.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  x^6          2:  x^6        1: 360 x^2
         .            1:  4             .
                          .
     
       ' x^6 &lt;RET&gt;          4         Z &lt; a d x &lt;RET&gt; Z &gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here we have computed the fourth derivative of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^6</span></samp>&rsquo; by
enclosing a derivative command in a &ldquo;repeat loop&rdquo; structure. 
This structure pops a repeat count from the stack, then
executes the body of the loop that many times.

   <p>If you make a mistake while entering the body of the loop,
type <kbd>Z&nbsp;C-g</kbd><!-- /@w --> to cancel the loop command.

   <p><a name="index-Fibonacci-numbers-73"></a>Here's another example:

<pre class="smallexample">     3:  1               2:  10946
     2:  1               1:  17711
     1:  20                  .
         .
     
     1 &lt;RET&gt; &lt;RET&gt; 20       Z &lt; &lt;TAB&gt; C-j + Z &gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The numbers in levels 2 and 1 should be the 21st and 22nd Fibonacci
numbers, respectively.  (To see what's going on, try a few repetitions
of the loop body by hand; <kbd>C-j</kbd>, also on the Line-Feed or &lt;LFD&gt;
key if you have one, makes a copy of the number in level 2.)

   <p><a name="index-Golden-ratio-74"></a><a name="index-Phi_002c-golden-ratio-75"></a>A fascinating property of the Fibonacci numbers is that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;th
Fibonacci number can be found directly by computing
<!-- @math{\phi^n / \sqrt{5}} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phi^n / sqrt(5)</span></samp>&rsquo;
and then rounding to the nearest integer, where
<!-- @math{\phi} (``phi''), -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phi</span></samp>&rsquo;,
the &ldquo;golden ratio,&rdquo; is
<!-- @math{(1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2}. -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(1 + sqrt(5)) / 2</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(For convenience, this constant is available from the <code>phi</code>
variable, or the <kbd>I H P</kbd> command.)

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  1.61803         1:  24476.0000409    1:  10945.9999817    1:  10946
         .                   .                    .                    .
     
         I H P               21 ^                 5 Q /                R
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Continued-fractions-76"></a>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 5.</strong>  The <dfn>continued fraction</dfn>
representation of
<!-- @math{\phi} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phi</span></samp>&rsquo;
is
<!-- @math{1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/( \ldots )))}. -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/( ... )))</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
We can compute an approximate value by carrying this however far
and then replacing the innermost
<!-- @math{1/( \ldots )} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/( ... )</span></samp>&rsquo;
by 1.  Approximate
<!-- @math{\phi} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phi</span></samp>&rsquo;
using a twenty-term continued fraction. 
See <a href="Programming-Answer-5.html#Programming-Answer-5">5</a>. (&bull;)

   <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 6.</strong>  Linear recurrences like the one for
Fibonacci numbers can be expressed in terms of matrices.  Given a
vector &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a,&nbsp;b]</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> determine a matrix which, when multiplied by this
vector, produces the vector &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[b, c]</span></samp>&rsquo;, where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; are three successive Fibonacci numbers.  Now write a program
that, given an integer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, computes the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;th Fibonacci number
using matrix arithmetic.  See <a href="Programming-Answer-6.html#Programming-Answer-6">6</a>. (&bull;)

   <p><a name="index-Harmonic-numbers-77"></a>A more sophisticated kind of loop is the <dfn>for</dfn> loop.  Suppose
we wish to compute the 20th &ldquo;harmonic&rdquo; number, which is equal to
the sum of the reciprocals of the integers from 1 to 20.

<pre class="smallexample">     3:  0               1:  3.597739
     2:  1                   .
     1:  20
         .
     
     0 &lt;RET&gt; 1 &lt;RET&gt; 20         Z ( &amp; + 1 Z )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop pops two numbers, the lower and upper limits, then
repeats the body of the loop as an internal counter increases from
the lower limit to the upper one.  Just before executing the loop
body, it pushes the current loop counter.  When the loop body
finishes, it pops the &ldquo;step,&rdquo; i.e., the amount by which to
increment the loop counter.  As you can see, our loop always
uses a step of one.

   <p>This harmonic number function uses the stack to hold the running
total as well as for the various loop housekeeping functions.  If
you find this disorienting, you can sum in a variable instead:

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  0         2:  1                  .            1:  3.597739
         .         1:  20                                  .
                       .
     
         0 t 7       1 &lt;RET&gt; 20      Z ( &amp; s + 7 1 Z )       r 7
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <kbd>s +</kbd> command adds the top-of-stack into the value in a
variable (and removes that value from the stack).

   <p>It's worth noting that many jobs that call for a &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop can
also be done more easily by Calc's high-level operations.  Two
other ways to compute harmonic numbers are to use vector mapping
and reduction (<kbd>v x 20</kbd>, then <kbd>V&nbsp;M&nbsp;&amp;</kbd><!-- /@w -->, then <kbd>V R +</kbd>),
or to use the summation command <kbd>a +</kbd>.  Both of these are
probably easier than using loops.  However, there are some
situations where loops really are the way to go:

   <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 7.</strong>  Use a &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop to find the first
harmonic number which is greater than 4.0. 
See <a href="Programming-Answer-7.html#Programming-Answer-7">7</a>. (&bull;)

   <p>Of course, if we're going to be using variables in our programs,
we have to worry about the programs clobbering values that the
caller was keeping in those same variables.  This is easy to
fix, though:

<pre class="smallexample">         .        1:  0.6667       1:  0.6667     3:  0.6667
                      .                .          2:  3.597739
                                                  1:  0.6667
                                                      .
     
        Z `    p 4 &lt;RET&gt; 2 &lt;RET&gt; 3 /   s 7 s s a &lt;RET&gt;    Z '  r 7 s r a &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">When we type <kbd>Z `</kbd> (that's a back-quote character), Calc saves
its mode settings and the contents of the ten &ldquo;quick variables&rdquo;
for later reference.  When we type <kbd>Z '</kbd> (that's an apostrophe
now), Calc restores those saved values.  Thus the <kbd>p 4</kbd> and
<kbd>s 7</kbd> commands have no effect outside this sequence.  Wrapping
this around the body of a keyboard macro ensures that it doesn't
interfere with what the user of the macro was doing.  Notice that
the contents of the stack, and the values of named variables,
survive past the <kbd>Z '</kbd> command.

   <p><a name="index-Bernoulli-numbers_002c-approximate-78"></a>The <dfn>Bernoulli numbers</dfn> are a sequence with the interesting
property that all of the odd Bernoulli numbers are zero, and the
even ones, while difficult to compute, can be roughly approximated
by the formula
<!-- @math{\displaystyle{2 n! \over (2 \pi)^n}}. -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 n! / (2 pi)^n</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Let's write a keyboard macro to compute (approximate) Bernoulli numbers. 
(Calc has a command, <kbd>k b</kbd>, to compute exact Bernoulli numbers, but
this command is very slow for large &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; since the higher Bernoulli
numbers are very large fractions.)

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  10               1:  0.0756823
         .                    .
     
         10     C-x ( &lt;RET&gt; 2 % Z [ &lt;DEL&gt; 0 Z : ' 2 $! / (2 pi)^$ &lt;RET&gt; = Z ] C-x )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can read <kbd>Z [</kbd> as &ldquo;then,&rdquo; <kbd>Z :</kbd> as &ldquo;else,&rdquo; and
<kbd>Z ]</kbd> as &ldquo;end-if.&rdquo;  There is no need for an explicit &ldquo;if&rdquo;
command.  For the purposes of <kbd>Z&nbsp;[</kbd><!-- /@w -->, the condition is &ldquo;true&rdquo;
if the value it pops from the stack is a nonzero number, or &ldquo;false&rdquo;
if it pops zero or something that is not a number (like a formula). 
Here we take our integer argument modulo 2; this will be nonzero
if we're asking for an odd Bernoulli number.

   <p>The actual tenth Bernoulli number is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5/66</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<pre class="smallexample">     3:  0.0756823    1:  0          1:  0.25305    1:  0          1:  1.16659
     2:  5:66             .              .              .              .
     1:  0.0757575
         .
     
     10 k b &lt;RET&gt; c f   M-0 &lt;DEL&gt; 11 X   &lt;DEL&gt; 12 X       &lt;DEL&gt; 13 X       &lt;DEL&gt; 14 X
</pre>
   <p>Just to exercise loops a bit more, let's compute a table of even
Bernoulli numbers.

<pre class="smallexample">     3:  []             1:  [0.10132, 0.03079, 0.02340, 0.033197, ...]
     2:  2                  .
     1:  30
         .
     
      [ ] 2 &lt;RET&gt; 30          Z ( X | 2 Z )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The vertical-bar <kbd>|</kbd> is the vector-concatenation command.  When
we execute it, the list we are building will be in stack level 2
(initially this is an empty list), and the next Bernoulli number
will be in level 1.  The effect is to append the Bernoulli number
onto the end of the list.  (To create a table of exact fractional
Bernoulli numbers, just replace <kbd>X</kbd> with <kbd>k b</kbd> in the above

   <p>With loops and conditionals, you can program essentially anything
in Calc.  One other command that makes looping easier is <kbd>Z /</kbd>,
which takes a condition from the stack and breaks out of the enclosing
loop if the condition is true (non-zero).  You can use this to make
&ldquo;while&rdquo; and &ldquo;until&rdquo; style loops.

   <p>If you make a mistake when entering a keyboard macro, you can edit
it using <kbd>Z E</kbd>.  First, you must attach it to a key with <kbd>Z K</kbd>. 
One technique is to enter a throwaway dummy definition for the macro,
then enter the real one in the edit command.

While this sum is not guaranteed to converge, in practice it is safe. 
An interesting mathematical constant is Euler's gamma, which is equal

   <p><a name="index-Recursion-83"></a>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 11.</strong>  The <dfn>Stirling numbers of the
first kind</dfn> are defined by the recurrences,

</pre>
   <p>This can be implemented using a <dfn>recursive</dfn> program in Calc; the
program must invoke itself in order to calculate the two righthand
terms in the general formula.  Since it always invokes itself with
&ldquo;simpler&rdquo; arguments, it's easy to see that it must eventually finish
the computation.  Recursion is a little difficult with Emacs keyboard
macros since the macro is executed before its definition is complete. 
So here's the recommended strategy:  Create a &ldquo;dummy macro&rdquo; and assign
it to a key with, e.g., <kbd>Z K s</kbd>.  Now enter the true definition,
using the <kbd>z s</kbd> command to call itself recursively, then assign it
to the same key with <kbd>Z K s</kbd>.  Now the <kbd>z s</kbd> command will run
the complete recursive program.  (Another way is to use <kbd>Z&nbsp;E</kbd><!-- /@w -->
or <kbd>C-x * m</kbd> (<code>read-kbd-macro</code>) to read the whole macro at once,
thus avoiding the &ldquo;training&rdquo; phase.)  The task:  Write a program
that computes Stirling numbers of the first kind, given &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack.  Test it with <em>small</em> inputs like

   <p>The programming commands we've seen in this part of the tutorial
are low-level, general-purpose operations.  Often you will find
that a higher-level function, such as vector mapping or rewrite
rules, will do the job much more easily than a detailed, step-by-step
program can:
