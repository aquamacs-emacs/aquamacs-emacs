<h4 class="subsection">8.6.3 Present Value</h4>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-b-P-876"></a><a name="index-calc_002dfin_002dpv-877"></a><a name="index-pv-878"></a>The <kbd>b P</kbd> (<code>calc-fin-pv</code>) [<code>pv</code>] command computes
the present value of an investment.  Like <code>fv</code>, it takes
three arguments:  <code>pv(</code><var>rate</var><code>, </code><var>n</var><code>, </code><var>payment</var><code>)</code>. 
It computes the present value of a series of regular payments. 
Suppose you have the chance to make an investment that will
pay $2000 per year over the next four years; as you receive
these payments you can put them in the bank at 9% interest. 
You want to know whether it is better to make the investment, or
to keep the money in the bank where it earns 9% interest right
from the start.  The calculation <code>pv(9%, 4, 2000)</code> gives the
result 6479.44.  If your initial investment must be less than this,
say, $6000, then the investment is worthwhile.  But if you had to
put up $7000, then it would be better just to leave it in the bank.

   <p>Here is the interpretation of the result of <code>pv</code>:  You are
trying to compare the return from the investment you are
considering, which is <code>fv(9%, 4, 2000) = 9146.26</code>, with
the return from leaving the money in the bank, which is
<code>fvl(9%, 4, </code><var>x</var><code>)</code> where <var>x</var> is the amount of money
you would have to put up in advance.  The <code>pv</code> function
finds the break-even point, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x = 6479.44</span></samp>&rsquo;, at which
<code>fvl(9%, 4, 6479.44)</code> is also equal to 9146.26.  This is
the largest amount you should be willing to invest.

   <p><a name="index-I-b-P-879"></a><a name="index-pvb-880"></a>The <kbd>I b P</kbd> [<code>pvb</code>] command solves the same problem,
but with payments occurring at the beginning of each interval. 
It has the same relationship to <code>fvb</code> as <code>pv</code> has
to <code>fv</code>.  For example <code>pvb(9%, 4, 2000) = 7062.59</code>,
a larger number than <code>pv</code> produced because we get to start
earning interest on the return from our investment sooner.

   <p><a name="index-H-b-P-881"></a><a name="index-pvl-882"></a>The <kbd>H b P</kbd> [<code>pvl</code>] command computes the present value of
an investment that will pay off in one lump sum at the end of the
period.  For example, if we get our $8000 all at the end of the
four years, <code>pvl(9%, 4, 8000) = 5667.40</code>.  This is much
less than <code>pv</code> reported, because we don't earn any interest
on the return from this investment.  Note that <code>pvl</code> and
<code>fvl</code> are simple inverses:  <code>fvl(9%, 4, 5667.40) = 8000</code>.

   <p>You can give an optional fourth lump-sum argument to <code>pv</code>
and <code>pvb</code>; this is handled in exactly the same way as the
fourth argument for <code>fv</code> and <code>fvb</code>.

   <p><a name="index-b-N-883"></a><a name="index-calc_002dfin_002dnpv-884"></a><a name="index-npv-885"></a>The <kbd>b N</kbd> (<code>calc-fin-npv</code>) [<code>npv</code>] command computes
the net present value of a series of irregular investments. 
The first argument is the interest rate.  The second argument is
a vector which represents the expected return from the investment
at the end of each interval.  For example, if the rate represents
a yearly interest rate, then the vector elements are the return
from the first year, second year, and so on.

   <p>Thus, <code>npv(9%, [2000,2000,2000,2000]) = pv(9%, 4, 2000) = 6479.44</code>. 
Obviously this function is more interesting when the payments are
not all the same!

   <p>The <code>npv</code> function can actually have two or more arguments. 
Multiple arguments are interpreted in the same way as for the
vector statistical functions like <code>vsum</code>. 
See <a href="Single_002dVariable-Statistics.html#Single_002dVariable-Statistics">Single-Variable Statistics</a>.  Basically, if there are several
payment arguments, each either a vector or a plain number, all these
values are collected left-to-right into the complete list of payments. 
A numeric prefix argument on the <kbd>b N</kbd> command says how many
payment values or vectors to take from the stack.

   <p><a name="index-I-b-N-886"></a><a name="index-npvb-887"></a>The <kbd>I b N</kbd> [<code>npvb</code>] command computes the net present
value where payments occur at the beginning of each interval
rather than at the end.
