<h4 class="subsection">3.7.33 Types Tutorial Exercise 1</h4>

<p class="noindent">If the number is the square root of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pi</span></samp>&rsquo; times a rational number,
then its square, divided by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pi</span></samp>&rsquo;, should be a rational number.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  1.26508260337    1:  0.509433962268   1:  2486645810:4881193627
         .                    .                    .
     
                              2 ^ P /              c F
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Technically speaking this is a rational number, but not one that is
likely to have arisen in the original problem.  More likely, it just
happens to be the fraction which most closely represents some
irrational number to within 12 digits.

   <p>But perhaps our result was not quite exact.  Let's reduce the
precision slightly and try again:

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  0.509433962268     1:  27:53
         .                      .
     
         U p 10 &lt;RET&gt;             c F
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Aha!  It's unlikely that an irrational number would equal a fraction
this simple to within ten digits, so our original number was probably
<!-- @math{\sqrt{27 \pi / 53}}. -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(27 pi / 53)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Notice that we didn't need to re-round the number when we reduced the
precision.  Remember, arithmetic operations always round their inputs
to the current precision before they begin.
