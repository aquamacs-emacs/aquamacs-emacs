<h4 class="subsection">11.11.7 Nested Formulas with Rewrite Rules</h4>

<p class="noindent">When <kbd>a r</kbd> (<code>calc-rewrite</code>) is used, it takes an expression from
the top of the stack and attempts to match any of the specified rules
to any part of the expression, starting with the whole expression
and then, if that fails, trying deeper and deeper sub-expressions. 
For each part of the expression, the rules are tried in the order
they appear in the rules vector.  The first rule to match the first
sub-expression wins; it replaces the matched sub-expression according
to the <var>new</var> part of the rule.

   <p>Often, the rule set will match and change the formula several times. 
The top-level formula is first matched and substituted repeatedly until
it no longer matches the pattern; then, sub-formulas are tried, and
so on.  Once every part of the formula has gotten its chance, the
rewrite mechanism starts over again with the top-level formula
(in case a substitution of one of its arguments has caused it again
to match).  This continues until no further matches can be made
anywhere in the formula.

   <p>It is possible for a rule set to get into an infinite loop.  The
most obvious case, replacing a formula with itself, is not a problem
because a rule is not considered to &ldquo;succeed&rdquo; unless the righthand
side actually comes out to something different than the original
formula or sub-formula that was matched.  But if you accidentally
had both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln(a b) := ln(a) + ln(b)</span></samp>&rsquo; and the reverse
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln(a) + ln(b) := ln(a b)</span></samp>&rsquo; in your rule set, Calc would
run forever switching a formula back and forth between the two
forms.

   <p>To avoid disaster, Calc normally stops after 100 changes have been
made to the formula.  This will be enough for most multiple rewrites,
but it will keep an endless loop of rewrites from locking up the
computer forever.  (On most systems, you can also type <kbd>C-g</kbd> to
halt any Emacs command prematurely.)

   <p>To change this limit, give a positive numeric prefix argument. 
In particular, <kbd>M-1 a r</kbd> applies only one rewrite at a time,
useful when you are first testing your rule (or just if repeated
rewriting is not what is called for by your application).

   <p><a name="index-iterations-1933"></a>You can also put a &ldquo;function call&rdquo; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">iterations(</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;
in place of a rule anywhere in your rules vector (but usually at
the top).  Then, <var>n</var> will be used instead of 100 as the default
number of iterations for this rule set.  You can use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">iterations(inf)</span></samp>&rsquo; if you want no iteration limit by default. 
A prefix argument will override the <code>iterations</code> limit in the
rule set.

<pre class="example">     [ iterations(1),
       f(x) := f(x+1) ]
</pre>
   <p>More precisely, the limit controls the number of &ldquo;iterations,&rdquo;
where each iteration is a successful matching of a rule pattern whose
righthand side, after substituting meta-variables and applying the
default simplifications, is different from the original sub-formula
that was matched.

   <p>A prefix argument of zero sets the limit to infinity.  Use with caution!

   <p>Given a negative numeric prefix argument, <kbd>a r</kbd> will match and
substitute the top-level expression up to that many times, but
will not attempt to match the rules to any sub-expressions.

   <p>In a formula, <code>rewrite(</code><var>expr</var><code>, </code><var>rules</var><code>, </code><var>n</var><code>)</code>
does a rewriting operation.  Here <var>expr</var> is the expression
being rewritten, <var>rules</var> is the rule, vector of rules, or
variable containing the rules, and <var>n</var> is the optional
iteration limit, which may be a positive integer, a negative
integer, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If <var>n</var> is omitted
the <code>iterations</code> value from the rule set is used; if both
are omitted, 100 is used.
