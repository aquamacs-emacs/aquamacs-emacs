<h5 class="subsubsection">7.8.11.1 Syntax Table Basics</h5>

<p class="noindent"><dfn>Parsing</dfn> is the process of converting a raw string of characters,
such as you would type in during algebraic entry, into a Calc formula. 
Calc's parser works in two stages.  First, the input is broken down
into <dfn>tokens</dfn>, such as words, numbers, and punctuation symbols
like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+/-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Space between tokens is
ignored (except when it serves to separate adjacent words).  Next,
the parser matches this string of tokens against various built-in
syntactic patterns, such as &ldquo;an expression followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;
followed by another expression&rdquo; or &ldquo;a name followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo;,
zero or more expressions separated by commas, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;.&rdquo;

   <p>A <dfn>syntax table</dfn> is a list of user-defined <dfn>syntax rules</dfn>,
which allow you to specify new patterns to define your own
favorite input notations.  Calc's parser always checks the syntax
table for the current language mode, then the table for the Normal
language mode, before it uses its built-in rules to parse an
algebraic formula you have entered.  Each syntax rule should go on
its own line; it consists of a <dfn>pattern</dfn>, a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol,
and a Calc formula with an optional <dfn>condition</dfn>.  (Syntax rules
resemble algebraic rewrite rules, but the notation for patterns is
completely different.)

   <p>A syntax pattern is a list of tokens, separated by spaces. 
Except for a few special symbols, tokens in syntax patterns are
matched literally, from left to right.  For example, the rule,

<pre class="example">     foo ( ) := 2+3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would cause Calc to parse the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4+foo()*5</span></samp>&rsquo; as if it
were &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4+(2+3)*5</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Notice that the parentheses were written
as two separate tokens in the rule.  As a result, the rule works
for both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo()</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;)</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  If we had written
the rule as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo () := 2+3</span></samp>&rsquo;, then Calc would treat &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">()</span></samp>&rsquo;
as a single, indivisible token, so that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo(&nbsp;)</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> would
not be recognized by the rule.  (It would be parsed as a regular
zero-argument function call instead.)  In fact, this rule would
also make trouble for the rest of Calc's parser:  An unrelated
formula like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar()</span></samp>&rsquo; would now be tokenized into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar ()</span></samp>&rsquo;
instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar ( )</span></samp>&rsquo;, so that the standard parser for function
calls would no longer recognize it!

   <p>While it is possible to make a token with a mixture of letters
and punctuation symbols, this is not recommended.  It is better to
break it into several tokens, as we did with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo()</span></samp>&rsquo; above.

   <p>The symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; in a syntax pattern matches any Calc expression. 
On the righthand side, the things that matched the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;s can
be referred to as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#1</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#2</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on (where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#1</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches the leftmost &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; in the pattern).  For example, these
rules match a user-defined function, prefix operator, infix operator,
and postfix operator, respectively:

<pre class="example">     foo ( # ) := myfunc(#1)
     foo # := myprefix(#1)
     # foo # := myinfix(#1,#2)
     # foo := mypostfix(#1)
</pre>
   <p>Thus &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo(3)</span></samp>&rsquo; will parse as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myfunc(3)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2+3 foo</span></samp>&rsquo;
will parse as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mypostfix(2+3)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>It is important to write the first two rules in the order shown,
because Calc tries rules in order from first to last.  If the
pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo #</span></samp>&rsquo; came first, it would match anything that could
match the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo ( # )</span></samp>&rsquo; rule, since an expression in parentheses
is itself a valid expression.  Thus the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo&nbsp;(&nbsp;#&nbsp;)</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> rule would
never get to match anything.  Likewise, the last two rules must be
written in the order shown or else &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3 foo 4</span></samp>&rsquo; will be parsed as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mypostfix(3) * 4</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (Of course, the best way to avoid these
ambiguities is not to use the same symbol in more than one way at
the same time!  In case you're not convinced, try the following
exercise:  How will the above rules parse the input &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo(3,4)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
if at all?  Work it out for yourself, then try it in Calc and see.)

   <p>Calc is quite flexible about what sorts of patterns are allowed. 
The only rule is that every pattern must begin with a literal
token (like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; in the first two patterns above), or with
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by a literal token (as in the last two
patterns).  After that, any mixture is allowed, although putting
two &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;s in a row will not be very useful since two
expressions with nothing between them will be parsed as one
expression that uses implicit multiplication.

   <p>As a more practical example, Maple uses the notation
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(a(i), i=1..10)</span></samp>&rsquo; for sums, which Calc's Maple mode doesn't
recognize at present.  To handle this syntax, we simply add the
rule,

<pre class="example">     sum ( # , # = # .. # ) := sum(#1,#2,#3,#4)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to the Maple mode syntax table.  As another example, C mode can't
read assignment operators like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">++</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*=</span></samp>&rsquo;.  We can
define these operators quite easily:

<pre class="example">     # *= # := muleq(#1,#2)
     # ++ := postinc(#1)
     ++ # := preinc(#1)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To complete the job, we would use corresponding composition functions
and <kbd>Z C</kbd> to cause these functions to display in their respective
Maple and C notations.  (Note that the C example ignores issues of
operator precedence, which are discussed in the next section.)

   <p>You can enclose any token in quotes to prevent its usual
interpretation in syntax patterns:

<pre class="example">     # ":=" # := becomes(#1,#2)
</pre>
   <p>Quotes also allow you to include spaces in a token, although once
again it is generally better to use two tokens than one token with
an embedded space.  To include an actual quotation mark in a quoted
token, precede it with a backslash.  (This also works to include
backslashes in tokens.)

<pre class="example">     # "bad token" # "/\"\\" # := silly(#1,#2,#3)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will parse &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3 bad token 4 /"\ 5</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">silly(3,4,5)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The token <kbd>#</kbd> has a predefined meaning in Calc's formula parser;
it is not valid to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"#"</span></samp>&rsquo; in a syntax rule.  However, longer
tokens that include the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; character are allowed.  Also, while
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"$"</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"\""</span></samp>&rsquo; are allowed as tokens, their presence in
the syntax table will prevent those characters from working in their
usual ways (referring to stack entries and quoting strings,
respectively).

   <p>Finally, the notation &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo; anywhere in a syntax table causes
the rest of the line to be ignored as a comment.
