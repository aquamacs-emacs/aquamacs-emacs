<h4 class="subsection">3.7.57 Rewrites Tutorial Exercise 6</h4>

<p class="noindent">Here is a rule set that will do the job:

<pre class="smallexample">     [ a*(b + c) := a*b + a*c,
       opt(a) O(x^n) + opt(b) O(x^m) := O(x^n) :: n &lt;= m
          :: constant(a) :: constant(b),
       opt(a) O(x^n) + opt(b) x^m := O(x^n) :: n &lt;= m
          :: constant(a) :: constant(b),
       a O(x^n) := O(x^n) :: constant(a),
       x^opt(m) O(x^n) := O(x^(n+m)),
       O(x^n) O(x^m) := O(x^(n+m)) ]
</pre>
   <p>If we really want the <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>*</kbd> keys to operate naturally
on power series, we should put these rules in <code>EvalRules</code>.  For
testing purposes, it is better to put them in a different variable,
say, <code>O</code>, first.

   <p>The first rule just expands products of sums so that the rest of the
rules can assume they have an expanded-out polynomial to work with. 
Note that this rule does not mention &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O</span></samp>&rsquo; at all, so it will
apply to any product-of-sum it encounters&mdash;this rule may surprise
you if you put it into <code>EvalRules</code>!

   <p>In the second rule, the sum of two O's is changed to the smaller O. 
The optional constant coefficients are there mostly so that
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O(x^2) - O(x^3)</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O(x^3) - O(x^2)</span></samp>&rsquo; are handled
as well as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O(x^2) + O(x^3)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The third rule absorbs higher powers of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; into O's.

   <p>The fourth rule says that a constant times a negligible quantity
is still negligible.  (This rule will also match &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O(x^3) / 4</span></samp>&rsquo;,
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a = 1/4</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

   <p>The fifth rule rewrites, for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2 O(x^3)</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O(x^5)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(It is easy to see that if one of these forms is negligible, the other
is, too.)  Notice the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^opt(m)</span></samp>&rsquo; to pick up terms like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x&nbsp;O(x^3)</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  Optional powers will match &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^1</span></samp>&rsquo;
but not 1 as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^0</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This turns out to be exactly what we want here.

   <p>The sixth rule is the corresponding rule for products of two O's.

   <p>Another way to solve this problem would be to create a new &ldquo;data type&rdquo;
that represents truncated power series.  We might represent these as
function calls &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">series(</span><var>coefs</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>x</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; where <var>coefs</var> is
a vector of coefficients for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^0</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^1</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so
on.  Rules would exist for sums and products of such <code>series</code>
objects, and as an optional convenience could also know how to combine a
<code>series</code> object with a normal polynomial.  (With this, and with a
rule that rewrites &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O(x^n)</span></samp>&rsquo; to the equivalent <code>series</code> form,
you could still enter power series in exactly the same notation as
before.)  Operations on such objects would probably be more efficient,
although the objects would be a bit harder to read.

<!-- [fix-ref Compositions] -->
   <p>Some other symbolic math programs provide a power series data type
similar to this.  Mathematica, for example, has an object that looks
like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PowerSeries[</span><var>x</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>x0</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>coefs</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>nmin</var><span class="samp">,
</span><var>nmax</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>den</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>x0</var> is the point about which the
power series is taken (we've been assuming this was always zero),
and <var>nmin</var>, <var>nmax</var>, and <var>den</var> allow pseudo-power-series
with fractional or negative powers.  Also, the <code>PowerSeries</code>
objects have a special display format that makes them look like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x^2 + O(x^4)</span></samp>&rsquo; when they are printed out.  (See <a href="Compositions.html#Compositions">Compositions</a>,
for a way to do this in Calc, although for something as involved as
this it would probably be better to write the formatting routine
in Lisp.)
