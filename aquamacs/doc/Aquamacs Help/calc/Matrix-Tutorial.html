<h4 class="subsection">3.3.2 Matrices</h4>

<p class="noindent">A <dfn>matrix</dfn> is just a vector of vectors, all the same length. 
This means you can enter a matrix using nested brackets.  You can
also use the semicolon character to enter a matrix.  We'll show
both methods here:

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]             1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]                 [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]
         .                             .
     
       [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]             ' [1 2 3; 4 5 6] &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">We'll be using this matrix again, so type <kbd>s 4</kbd> to save it now.

   <p>Note that semicolons work with incomplete vectors, but they work
better in algebraic entry.  That's why we use the apostrophe in
the second example.

   <p>When two matrices are multiplied, the lefthand matrix must have
the same number of columns as the righthand matrix has rows. 
Row &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;, column &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">j</span></samp>&rsquo; of the result is effectively the
dot product of row &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; of the left matrix by column &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">j</span></samp>&rsquo;
of the right matrix.

   <p>If we try to duplicate this matrix and multiply it by itself,
the dimensions are wrong and the multiplication cannot take place:

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]   * [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]     [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]
         .
     
         &lt;RET&gt; *
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Though rather hard to read, this is a formula which shows the product
of two matrices.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; function, having invalid arguments, has
been left in symbolic form.

   <p>We can multiply the matrices if we <dfn>transpose</dfn> one of them first.

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]       1:  [ [ 14, 32 ]      1:  [ [ 17, 22, 27 ]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]           [ 32, 77 ] ]          [ 22, 29, 36 ]
     1:  [ [ 1, 4 ]              .                       [ 27, 36, 45 ] ]
           [ 2, 5 ]                                    .
           [ 3, 6 ] ]
         .
     
         U v t                   *                     U &lt;TAB&gt; *
</pre>
   <p>Matrix multiplication is not commutative; indeed, switching the
order of the operands can even change the dimensions of the result
matrix, as happened here!

   <p>If you multiply a plain vector by a matrix, it is treated as a
single row or column depending on which side of the matrix it is
on.  The result is a plain vector which should also be interpreted
as a row or column as appropriate.

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]      1:  [14, 32]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]        .
     1:  [1, 2, 3]
         .
     
         r 4 r 1                *
</pre>
   <p>Multiplying in the other order wouldn't work because the number of
rows in the matrix is different from the number of elements in the
vector.

   <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong>  Use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to sum along the rows
of the above
<!-- @math{2\times3} -->
2x3
matrix to get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[6, 15]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Now use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; to sum along the columns
to get &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[5, 7, 9]</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
See <a href="Matrix-Answer-1.html#Matrix-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)

   <p><a name="index-Identity-matrix-38"></a>An <dfn>identity matrix</dfn> is a square matrix with ones along the
diagonal and zeros elsewhere.  It has the property that multiplication
by an identity matrix, on the left or on the right, always produces
the original matrix.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]      2:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]      1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]          [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]          [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]
         .                  1:  [ [ 1, 0, 0 ]          .
                                  [ 0, 1, 0 ]
                                  [ 0, 0, 1 ] ]
                                .
     
         r 4                    v i 3 &lt;RET&gt;              *
</pre>
   <p>If a matrix is square, it is often possible to find its <dfn>inverse</dfn>,
that is, a matrix which, when multiplied by the original matrix, yields
an identity matrix.  The <kbd>&amp;</kbd> (reciprocal) key also computes the
inverse of a matrix.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]      1:  [ [   -2.4,     1.2,   -0.2 ]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ]            [    2.8,    -1.4,    0.4 ]
           [ 7, 6, 0 ] ]          [ -0.73333, 0.53333, -0.2 ] ]
         .                      .
     
         r 4 r 2 |  s 5         &amp;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The vertical bar <kbd>|</kbd> <dfn>concatenates</dfn> numbers, vectors, and
matrices together.  Here we have used it to add a new row onto
our matrix to make it square.

   <p>We can multiply these two matrices in either order to get an identity.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  [ [ 1., 0., 0. ]      1:  [ [ 1., 0., 0. ]
           [ 0., 1., 0. ]            [ 0., 1., 0. ]
           [ 0., 0., 1. ] ]          [ 0., 0., 1. ] ]
         .                         .
     
         M-&lt;RET&gt;  *                  U &lt;TAB&gt; *
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Systems-of-linear-equations-39"></a><a name="index-Linear-equations_002c-systems-of-40"></a>Matrix inverses are related to systems of linear equations in algebra. 
Suppose we had the following set of equations:

<pre class="example">         a + 2b + 3c = 6
        4a + 5b + 6c = 2
        7a + 6b      = 3
</pre>
<p class="noindent">This can be cast into the matrix equation,

<pre class="example">        [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]     [ [ a ]     [ [ 6 ]
          [ 4, 5, 6 ]   *   [ b ]   =   [ 2 ]
          [ 7, 6, 0 ] ]     [ c ] ]     [ 3 ] ]
</pre>
   <p>We can solve this system of equations by multiplying both sides by the
inverse of the matrix.  Calc can do this all in one step:

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  [6, 2, 3]          1:  [-12.6, 15.2, -3.93333]
     1:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]          .
           [ 4, 5, 6 ]
           [ 7, 6, 0 ] ]
         .
     
         [6,2,3] r 5            /
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The result is the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a, b, c]</span></samp>&rsquo; vector that solves the equations. 
(Dividing by a square matrix is equivalent to multiplying by its
inverse.)

   <p>Let's verify this solution:

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  [ [ 1, 2, 3 ]                1:  [6., 2., 3.]
           [ 4, 5, 6 ]                    .
           [ 7, 6, 0 ] ]
     1:  [-12.6, 15.2, -3.93333]
         .
     
         r 5  &lt;TAB&gt;                         *
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that we had to be careful about the order in which we multiplied
the matrix and vector.  If we multiplied in the other order, Calc would
assume the vector was a row vector in order to make the dimensions
come out right, and the answer would be incorrect.  If you
don't feel safe letting Calc take either interpretation of your
vectors, use explicit
<!-- @math{N\times1} -->
Nx1
or
<!-- @math{1\times N} -->
1xN
matrices instead.  In this case, you would enter the original column
vector as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[6], [2], [3]]</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[6; 2; 3]</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong>  Algebraic entry allows you to make
vectors and matrices that include variables.  Solve the following
system of equations to get expressions for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;
in terms of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<pre class="example">        x + a y = 6
        x + b y = 10
</pre>
<p class="noindent">See <a href="Matrix-Answer-2.html#Matrix-Answer-2">2</a>. (&bull;)

   <p><a name="index-Least_002dsquares-for-over_002ddetermined-systems-41"></a><a name="index-Over_002ddetermined-systems-of-equations-42"></a>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong>  A system of equations is &ldquo;over-determined&rdquo;
if it has more equations than variables.  It is often the case that
there are no values for the variables that will satisfy all the
equations at once, but it is still useful to find a set of values
which &ldquo;nearly&rdquo; satisfy all the equations.  In terms of matrix equations,
you can't solve &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A X = B</span></samp>&rsquo; directly because the matrix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;
is not square for an over-determined system.  Matrix inversion works
only for square matrices.  One common trick is to multiply both sides
on the left by the transpose of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">trn(A)*A*X = trn(A)*B</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Now
<!-- @math{A^T A} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">trn(A)*A</span></samp>&rsquo;
is a square matrix so a solution is possible.  It turns out that the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>&rsquo; vector you compute in this way will be a &ldquo;least-squares&rdquo;
solution, which can be regarded as the &ldquo;closest&rdquo; solution to the set
of equations.  Use Calc to solve the following over-determined
system:

<pre class="example">         a + 2b + 3c = 6
        4a + 5b + 6c = 2
        7a + 6b      = 3
        2a + 4b + 6c = 11
