<h3 class="section">14.5 Graphical Devices</h3>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-g-D-2159"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002ddevice-2160"></a>The <kbd>g D</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-device</code>) command sets the device name
(or &ldquo;terminal name&rdquo; in GNUPLOT lingo) to be used by <kbd>g p</kbd> commands
on this graph.  It does not affect the permanent default device name. 
If you enter a blank name, the device name reverts to the default. 
Enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; to see a list of supported devices.

   <p>With a positive numeric prefix argument, <kbd>g D</kbd> instead sets
the default device name, used by all plots in the future which do
not override it with a plain <kbd>g D</kbd> command.  If you enter a
blank line this command shows you the current default.  The special
name <code>default</code> signifies that Calc should choose <code>x11</code> if
the X window system is in use (as indicated by the presence of a
<code>DISPLAY</code> environment variable), <code>windows</code> on MS-Windows, or
otherwise <code>dumb</code> under GNUPLOT 3.0 and later, or
<code>postscript</code> under GNUPLOT 2.0.  This is the initial default
value.

   <p>The <code>dumb</code> device is an interface to &ldquo;dumb terminals,&rdquo; i.e.,
terminals with no special graphics facilities.  It writes a crude
picture of the graph composed of characters like <code>-</code> and <code>|</code>
to a buffer called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo;, which Calc then displays. 
The graph is made the same size as the Emacs screen, which on most
dumb terminals will be
<!-- @math{80\times24} -->
80x24
characters.  The graph is displayed in
an Emacs &ldquo;recursive edit&rdquo;; type <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to exit
the recursive edit and return to Calc.  Note that the <code>dumb</code>
device is present only in GNUPLOT 3.0 and later versions.

   <p>The word <code>dumb</code> may be followed by two numbers separated by
spaces.  These are the desired width and height of the graph in
characters.  Also, the device name <code>big</code> is like <code>dumb</code>
but creates a graph four times the width and height of the Emacs
screen.  You will then have to scroll around to view the entire
graph.  In the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, &lt;SPC&gt;, &lt;DEL&gt;,
<kbd>&lt;</kbd>, and <kbd>&gt;</kbd> are defined to scroll by one screenful in each
of the four directions.

   <p>With a negative numeric prefix argument, <kbd>g D</kbd> sets or displays
the device name used by <kbd>g P</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-print</code>).  This
is initially <code>postscript</code>.  If you don't have a PostScript
printer, you may decide once again to use <code>dumb</code> to create a
plot on any text-only printer.

   <p><a name="index-g-O-2161"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002doutput-2162"></a>The <kbd>g O</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-output</code>) command sets the name of the
output file used by GNUPLOT.  For some devices, notably <code>x11</code> and
<code>windows</code>, there is no output file and this information is not
used.  Many other &ldquo;devices&rdquo; are really file formats like
<code>postscript</code>; in these cases the output in the desired format
goes into the file you name with <kbd>g O</kbd>.  Type <kbd>g O stdout
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to set GNUPLOT to write to its standard output stream,
i.e., to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is the default setting.

   <p>Another special output name is <code>tty</code>, which means that GNUPLOT
is going to write graphics commands directly to its standard output,
which you wish Emacs to pass through to your terminal.  Tektronix
graphics terminals, among other devices, operate this way.  Calc does
this by telling GNUPLOT to write to a temporary file, then running a
sub-shell executing the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cat tempfile &gt;/dev/tty</span></samp>&rsquo;.  On
typical Unix systems, this will copy the temporary file directly to
the terminal, bypassing Emacs entirely.  You will have to type <kbd>C-l</kbd>
to Emacs afterwards to refresh the screen.

   <p>Once again, <kbd>g O</kbd> with a positive or negative prefix argument
sets the default or printer output file names, respectively.  In each
case you can specify <code>auto</code>, which causes Calc to invent a temporary
file name for each <kbd>g p</kbd> (or <kbd>g P</kbd>) command.  This temporary file
will be deleted once it has been displayed or printed.  If the output file
name is not <code>auto</code>, the file is not automatically deleted.

   <p>The default and printer devices and output files can be saved
permanently by the <kbd>m m</kbd> (<code>calc-save-modes</code>) command.  The
default number of data points (see <kbd>g N</kbd>) and the X geometry
(see <kbd>g X</kbd>) are also saved.  Other graph information is <em>not</em>
saved; you can save a graph's configuration simply by saving the contents
of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer.

   <p><a name="index-calc_002dgnuplot_002dplot_002dcommand-2163"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgnuplot_002ddefault_002ddevice-2164"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgnuplot_002ddefault_002doutput-2165"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgnuplot_002dprint_002dcommand-2166"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgnuplot_002dprint_002ddevice-2167"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgnuplot_002dprint_002doutput-2168"></a>You may wish to configure the default and
printer devices and output files for the whole system.  The relevant
Lisp variables are <code>calc-gnuplot-default-device</code> and <code>-output</code>,
and <code>calc-gnuplot-print-device</code> and <code>-output</code>.  The output
file names must be either strings as described above, or Lisp
expressions which are evaluated on the fly to get the output file names.

   <p>Other important Lisp variables are <code>calc-gnuplot-plot-command</code> and
<code>calc-gnuplot-print-command</code>, which give the system commands to
display or print the output of GNUPLOT, respectively.  These may be
<code>nil</code> if no command is necessary, or strings which can include
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; to signify the name of the file to be displayed or printed. 
Or, these variables may contain Lisp expressions which are evaluated
to display or print the output.  These variables are customizable
(see <a href="Customizing-Calc.html#Customizing-Calc">Customizing Calc</a>).

   <p><a name="index-g-x-2169"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002ddisplay-2170"></a>The <kbd>g x</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-display</code>) command lets you specify
on which X window system display your graphs should be drawn.  Enter
a blank line to see the current display name.  This command has no
effect unless the current device is <code>x11</code>.

   <p><a name="index-g-X-2171"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002dgeometry-2172"></a>The <kbd>g X</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-geometry</code>) command is a similar
command for specifying the position and size of the X window. 
The normal value is <code>default</code>, which generally means your
window manager will let you place the window interactively. 
Entering &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">800x500+0+0</span></samp>&rsquo; would create an 800-by-500 pixel
window in the upper-left corner of the screen.  This command has no
effect if the current device is <code>windows</code>.

   <p>The buffer called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; holds a transcript of the
session with GNUPLOT.  This shows the commands Calc has &ldquo;typed&rdquo; to
GNUPLOT and the responses it has received.  Calc tries to notice when an
error message has appeared here and display the buffer for you when
this happens.  You can check this buffer yourself if you suspect
something has gone wrong<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p><a name="index-g-C-2173"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002dcommand-2174"></a>The <kbd>g C</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-command</code>) command prompts you to
enter any line of text, then simply sends that line to the current
GNUPLOT process.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer looks deceptively
like a Shell buffer but you can't type commands in it yourself. 
Instead, you must use <kbd>g C</kbd> for this purpose.

   <p><a name="index-g-v-2175"></a><a name="index-g-V-2176"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002dview_002dcommands-2177"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002dview_002dtrail-2178"></a>The <kbd>g v</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-view-commands</code>) and <kbd>g V</kbd>
(<code>calc-graph-view-trail</code>) commands display the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffers, respectively, in another window. 
This happens automatically when Calc thinks there is something you
will want to see in either of these buffers.  If you type <kbd>g v</kbd>
or <kbd>g V</kbd> when the relevant buffer is already displayed, the
buffer is hidden again.  (Note that on MS-Windows, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot
Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer will usually show nothing of interest, because
GNUPLOT's responses are not communicated back to Calc.)

   <p>One reason to use <kbd>g v</kbd> is to add your own commands to the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer.  Press <kbd>g v</kbd>, then use
<kbd>C-x o</kbd> to switch into that window.  For example, GNUPLOT has
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set label</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set arrow</span></samp>&rsquo; commands that allow you to
annotate your plots.  Since Calc doesn't understand these commands,
you have to add them to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer
yourself, then use <kbd>g&nbsp;p</kbd><!-- /@w --> to replot using these new commands.  Note
that your commands must appear <em>before</em> the <code>plot</code> command. 
To get help on any GNUPLOT feature, type, e.g., <kbd>g C help set label</kbd>. 
You may have to type <kbd>g C &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> a few times to clear the
&ldquo;press return for more&rdquo; or &ldquo;subtopic of <small class="dots">...</small>&rdquo; requests. 
Note that Calc always sends commands (like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set nolabel</span></samp>&rsquo;) to
reset all plotting parameters to the defaults before each plot, so
to delete a label all you need to do is delete the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set label</span></samp>&rsquo;
line you added (or comment it out with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;) and then replot
with <kbd>g p</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-g-q-2179"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002dquit-2180"></a>You can use <kbd>g q</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-quit</code>) to kill the GNUPLOT
process that is running.  The next graphing command you give will
start a fresh GNUPLOT process.  The word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Graph</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in
the Calc window's mode line whenever a GNUPLOT process is currently
running.  The GNUPLOT process is automatically killed when you
exit Emacs if you haven't killed it manually by then.

   <p><a name="index-g-K-2181"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002dkill-2182"></a>The <kbd>g K</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-kill</code>) command is like <kbd>g q</kbd>
except that it also views the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Trail*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer so that
you can see the process being killed.  This is better if you are
killing GNUPLOT because you think it has gotten stuck.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> 
On MS-Windows, due to the peculiarities of how the Windows version of
GNUPLOT (called <samp><span class="command">wgnuplot</span></samp>) works, the GNUPLOT responses are
not communicated back to Calc.  Instead, you need to look them up in
the GNUPLOT command window that is displayed as in normal interactive
usage of GNUPLOT.
