<h4 class="subsection">18.5.1 Defining New Functions</h4>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-defmath-2317"></a>The <code>defmath</code> function (actually a Lisp macro) is like <code>defun</code>
except that code in the body of the definition can make use of the full
range of Calculator data types.  The prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">calcFunc-</span></samp>&rsquo; is added
to the specified name to get the actual Lisp function name.  As a simple
example,

<pre class="example">     (defmath myfact (n)
       (if (&gt; n 0)
           (* n (myfact (1- n)))
         1))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This actually expands to the code,

<pre class="example">     (defun calcFunc-myfact (n)
       (if (math-posp n)
           (math-mul n (calcFunc-myfact (math-add n -1)))
         1))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This function can be used in algebraic expressions, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myfact(5)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myfact</span></samp>&rsquo; function as it is defined above has the bug that an
expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myfact(a+b)</span></samp>&rsquo; will be simplified to 1 because the
formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a+b</span></samp>&rsquo; is not considered to be <code>posp</code>.  A robust
factorial function would be written along the following lines:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defmath myfact (n)
       (if (&gt; n 0)
           (* n (myfact (1- n)))
         (if (= n 0)
             1
           nil)))    ; this could be simplified as: (and (= n 0) 1)
</pre>
   <p>If a function returns <code>nil</code>, it is left unsimplified by the Calculator
(except that its arguments will be simplified).  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myfact(a+1+2)</span></samp>&rsquo;
will be simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myfact(a+3)</span></samp>&rsquo; but no further.  Beware that every
time the Calculator reexamines this formula it will attempt to resimplify
it, so your function ought to detect the returning-<code>nil</code> case as
efficiently as possible.

   <p>The following standard Lisp functions are treated by <code>defmath</code>:
<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>^</code> or
<code>expt</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>,
<code>/=</code>, <code>1+</code>, <code>1-</code>, <code>logand</code>, <code>logior</code>, <code>logxor</code>,
<code>logandc2</code>, <code>lognot</code>.  Also, <code>~=</code> is an abbreviation for
<code>math-nearly-equal</code>, which is useful in implementing Taylor series.

   <p>For other functions <var>func</var>, if a function by the name
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">calcFunc-</span><var>func</var></samp>&rsquo; exists it is used, otherwise if a function by the
name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">math-</span><var>func</var></samp>&rsquo; exists it is used, otherwise if <var>func</var> itself
is defined as a function it is used, otherwise &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">calcFunc-</span><var>func</var></samp>&rsquo; is
used on the assumption that this is a to-be-defined math function.  Also, if
the function name is quoted as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">('integerp a)</span></samp>&rsquo; the function name is
always used exactly as written (but not quoted).

   <p>Variable names have &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">var-</span></samp>&rsquo; prepended to them unless they appear in
the function's argument list or in an enclosing <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>,
<code>for</code>, or <code>foreach</code> form,
or their names already contain a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; character.  Thus a reference to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; is the same as a reference to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">var-foo</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>A few other Lisp extensions are available in <code>defmath</code> definitions:

     <ul>
<li>The <code>elt</code> function accepts any number of index variables. 
Note that Calc vectors are stored as Lisp lists whose first
element is the symbol <code>vec</code>; thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(elt v 2)</span></samp>&rsquo; yields
the second element of vector <code>v</code>, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(elt m i j)</span></samp>&rsquo;
yields one element of a Calc matrix.

     <li>The <code>setq</code> function has been extended to act like the Common
Lisp <code>setf</code> function.  (The name <code>setf</code> is recognized as
a synonym of <code>setq</code>.)  Specifically, the first argument of
<code>setq</code> can be an <code>nth</code>, <code>elt</code>, <code>car</code>, or <code>cdr</code> form,
in which case the effect is to store into the specified
element of a list.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(setq (elt m i j) x)</span></samp>&rsquo; stores &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;
into one element of a matrix.

     <li>A <code>for</code> looping construct is available.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(for ((i 0 10)) body)</span></samp>&rsquo; executes <code>body</code> once for each
binding of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; from zero to 10.  This is like a <code>let</code>
form in that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; is temporarily bound to the loop count
without disturbing its value outside the <code>for</code> construct. 
Nested loops, as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(for ((i 0 10) (j 0 (1- i) 2)) body)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
are also available.  For each value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo; from zero to 10,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">j</span></samp>&rsquo; counts from 0 to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i-1</span></samp>&rsquo; in steps of two.  Note that
<code>for</code> has the same general outline as <code>let*</code>, except
that each element of the header is a list of three or four
things, not just two.

     <li>The <code>foreach</code> construct loops over elements of a list. 
For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(foreach ((x (cdr v))) body)</span></samp>&rsquo; executes
<code>body</code> with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; bound to each element of Calc vector
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">v</span></samp>&rsquo; in turn.  The purpose of <code>cdr</code> here is to skip over
the initial <code>vec</code> symbol in the vector.

     <li>The <code>break</code> function breaks out of the innermost enclosing
<code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, or <code>foreach</code> loop.  If given a
value, as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(break x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, this value is returned by the
loop.  (Lisp loops otherwise always return <code>nil</code>.)

     <li>The <code>return</code> function prematurely returns from the enclosing
function.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(return (+ x y))</span></samp>&rsquo; returns &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x+y</span></samp>&rsquo;
as the value of a function.  You can use <code>return</code> anywhere
inside the body of the function. 
</ul>

   <p>Non-integer numbers (and extremely large integers) cannot be included
directly into a <code>defmath</code> definition.  This is because the Lisp
reader will fail to parse them long before <code>defmath</code> ever gets control. 
Instead, use the notation, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:"3.1415"</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In fact, any algebraic
formula can go between the quotes.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     (defmath sqexp (x)     ; sqexp(x) == sqrt(exp(x)) == exp(x*0.5)
       (and (numberp x)
            (exp :"x * 0.5")))
</pre>
   <p>expands to

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun calcFunc-sqexp (x)
       (and (math-numberp x)
            (calcFunc-exp (math-mul x '(float 5 -1)))))
</pre>
   <p>Note the use of <code>numberp</code> as a guard to ensure that the argument is
a number first, returning <code>nil</code> if not.  The exponential function
could itself have been included in the expression, if we had preferred:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:"exp(x * 0.5)"</span></samp>&rsquo;.  As another example, the multiplication-and-recursion
step of <code>myfact</code> could have been written

<pre class="example">     :"n * myfact(n-1)"
</pre>
   <p>A good place to put your <code>defmath</code> commands is your Calc init file
(the file given by <code>calc-settings-file</code>, typically
<samp><span class="file">~/.calc.el</span></samp>), which will not be loaded until Calc starts. 
If a file named <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> exists in your home directory, Emacs reads
and executes the Lisp forms in this file as it starts up.  While it may
seem reasonable to put your favorite <code>defmath</code> commands there,
this has the unfortunate side-effect that parts of the Calculator must be
loaded in to process the <code>defmath</code> commands whether or not you will
actually use the Calculator!  If you want to put the <code>defmath</code>
commands there (for example, if you redefine <code>calc-settings-file</code>
to be <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>), a better effect can be had by writing

<pre class="example">     (put 'calc-define 'thing '(progn
      (defmath ... )
      (defmath ... )
     ))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-calc_002ddefine-2318"></a>The <code>put</code> function adds a <dfn>property</dfn> to a symbol.  Each Lisp
symbol has a list of properties associated with it.  Here we add a
property with a name of <code>thing</code> and a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(progn ...)</span></samp>&rsquo; form as
its value.  When Calc starts up, and at the start of every Calc command,
the property list for the symbol <code>calc-define</code> is checked and the
values of any properties found are evaluated as Lisp forms.  The
properties are removed as they are evaluated.  The property names
(like <code>thing</code>) are not used; you should choose something like the
name of your project so as not to conflict with other properties.

   <p>The net effect is that you can put the above code in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
file and it will not be executed until Calc is loaded.  Or, you can put
that same code in another file which you load by hand either before or
after Calc itself is loaded.

   <p>The properties of <code>calc-define</code> are evaluated in the same order
that they were added.  They can assume that the Calc modules <samp><span class="file">calc.el</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">calc-ext.el</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">calc-macs.el</span></samp> have been fully loaded, and
that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Calculator*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer will be the current buffer.

   <p>If your <code>calc-define</code> property only defines algebraic functions,
you can be sure that it will have been evaluated before Calc tries to
call your function, even if the file defining the property is loaded
after Calc is loaded.  But if the property defines commands or key
sequences, it may not be evaluated soon enough.  (Suppose it defines the
new command <code>tweak-calc</code>; the user can load your file, then type
<kbd>M-x tweak-calc</kbd> before Calc has had chance to do anything.)  To
protect against this situation, you can put

<pre class="example">     (run-hooks 'calc-check-defines)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-calc_002dcheck_002ddefines-2319"></a>at the end of your file.  The <code>calc-check-defines</code> function is what
looks for and evaluates properties on <code>calc-define</code>; <code>run-hooks</code>
has the advantage that it is quietly ignored if <code>calc-check-defines</code>
is not yet defined because Calc has not yet been loaded.

   <p>Examples of things that ought to be enclosed in a <code>calc-define</code>
property are <code>defmath</code> calls, <code>define-key</code> calls that modify
the Calc key map, and any calls that redefine things defined inside Calc. 
Ordinary <code>defun</code>s need not be enclosed with <code>calc-define</code>.
