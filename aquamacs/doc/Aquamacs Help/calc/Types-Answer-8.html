<h4 class="subsection">3.7.40 Types Tutorial Exercise 8</h4>

<p class="noindent">The first answer is pretty simple:  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / (0 .. 10) = (0.1 .. inf)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Since a number in the interval &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(0 .. 10)</span></samp>&rsquo; can get arbitrarily
close to zero, its reciprocal can get arbitrarily large, so the answer
is an interval that effectively means, &ldquo;any number greater than 0.1&rdquo;
but with no upper bound.

   <p>The second answer, similarly, is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / (-10 .. 0) = (-inf .. -0.1)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Calc normally treats division by zero as an error, so that the formula
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1&nbsp;/&nbsp;0</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> is left unsimplified.  Our third problem,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1&nbsp;/&nbsp;[0&nbsp;..&nbsp;10]</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->, also (potentially) divides by zero because zero
is now a member of the interval.  So Calc leaves this one unevaluated, too.

   <p>If you turn on Infinite mode by pressing <kbd>m i</kbd>, you will
instead get the answer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0.1 .. inf]</span></samp>&rsquo;, which includes infinity
as a possible value.

   <p>The fourth calculation, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / (-10 .. 10)</span></samp>&rsquo;, has the same problem. 
Zero is buried inside the interval, but it's still a possible value. 
It's not hard to see that the actual result of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / (-10 .. 10)</span></samp>&rsquo;
will be either greater than <i>0.1</i>, or less than <i>-0.1</i>.  Thus
the interval goes from minus infinity to plus infinity, with a &ldquo;hole&rdquo;
in it from <i>-0.1</i> to <i>0.1</i>.  Calc doesn't have any way to
represent this, so it just reports &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[-inf .. inf]</span></samp>&rsquo; as the answer. 
It may be disappointing to hear &ldquo;the answer lies somewhere between
minus infinity and plus infinity, inclusive,&rdquo; but that's the best
that interval arithmetic can do in this case.
