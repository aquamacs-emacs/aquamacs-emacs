<h4 class="subsection">11.3.4 Simplification of Units</h4>

<p class="noindent">The simplifications described in this section are applied by the
<kbd>u s</kbd> (<code>calc-simplify-units</code>) command.  These are in addition
to the regular <kbd>a s</kbd> (but not <kbd>a e</kbd>) simplifications described
earlier.  See <a href="Basic-Operations-on-Units.html#Basic-Operations-on-Units">Basic Operations on Units</a>.

   <p>The variable <code>UnitSimpRules</code> contains rewrites to be applied by
the <kbd>u s</kbd> command.  These are applied in addition to <code>EvalRules</code>
and <code>AlgSimpRules</code>.

   <p>Scalar mode is automatically put into effect when simplifying units. 
See <a href="Matrix-Mode.html#Matrix-Mode">Matrix Mode</a>.

   <p>Sums &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b</span></samp>&rsquo; involving units are simplified by extracting the
units of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; as if by the <kbd>u x</kbd> command (call the result
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u_a</span></samp>&rsquo;), then simplifying the expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b / u_a</span></samp>&rsquo;
using <kbd>u b</kbd> and <kbd>u s</kbd>.  If the result has units then the sum
is inconsistent and is left alone.  Otherwise, it is rewritten
in terms of the units &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u_a</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If units auto-ranging mode is enabled, products or quotients in
which the first argument is a number which is out of range for the
leading unit are modified accordingly.

   <p>When cancelling and combining units in products and quotients,
Calc accounts for unit names that differ only in the prefix letter. 
For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 km m</span></samp>&rsquo; is simplified to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2000 m^2</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
However, compatible but different units like <code>ft</code> and <code>in</code>
are not combined in this way.

   <p>Quotients &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a / b</span></samp>&rsquo; are simplified in three additional ways.  First,
if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; is a number or a product beginning with a number, Calc
computes the reciprocal of this number and moves it to the numerator.

   <p>Second, for each pair of unit names from the numerator and denominator
of a quotient, if the units are compatible (e.g., they are both
units of area) then they are replaced by the ratio between those
units.  For example, in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3 s in N / kg cm</span></samp>&rsquo; the units
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">in / cm</span></samp>&rsquo; will be replaced by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2.54</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Third, if the units in the quotient exactly cancel out, so that
a <kbd>u b</kbd> command on the quotient would produce a dimensionless
number for an answer, then the quotient simplifies to that number.

   <p>For powers and square roots, the &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; simplifications
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a b)^c</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a^c b^c</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a/b)^c</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a^c / b^c</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a^b)^c</span></samp>&rsquo; to
<!-- @math{a^{b c}} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a^(b c)</span></samp>&rsquo;
are done if the powers are real numbers.  (These are safe in the context
of units because all numbers involved can reasonably be assumed to be
real.)

   <p>Also, if a unit name is raised to a fractional power, and the
base units in that unit name all occur to powers which are a
multiple of the denominator of the power, then the unit name
is expanded out into its base units, which can then be simplified
according to the previous paragraph.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">acre^1.5</span></samp>&rsquo;
is simplified by noting that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.5 = 3:2</span></samp>&rsquo;, that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">acre</span></samp>&rsquo;
is defined in terms of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m^2</span></samp>&rsquo;, and that the 2 in the power of
<code>m</code> is a multiple of 2 in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3:2</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Thus, <code>acre^1.5</code> is
replaced by approximately
<!-- @math{(4046 m^2)^{1.5}} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(4046 m^2)^1.5</span></samp>&rsquo;,
which is then changed to
<!-- @math{4046^{1.5} \, (m^2)^{1.5}}, -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4046^1.5 (m^2)^1.5</span></samp>&rsquo;,
then to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">257440 m^3</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The functions <code>float</code>, <code>frac</code>, <code>clean</code>, <code>abs</code>,
as well as <code>floor</code> and the other integer truncation functions,
applied to unit names or products or quotients involving units, are
simplified.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">round(1.6 in)</span></samp>&rsquo; is changed to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">round(1.6) round(in)</span></samp>&rsquo;; the lefthand term evaluates to 2,
and the righthand term simplifies to <code>in</code>.

   <p>The functions <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, and <code>tan</code> with arguments
that have angular units like <code>rad</code> or <code>arcmin</code> are
simplified by converting to base units (radians), then evaluating
with the angular mode temporarily set to radians.
