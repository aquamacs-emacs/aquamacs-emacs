<h3 class="section">11.9 Summations</h3>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-Summation-of-a-series-1824"></a><a name="index-a-_002b-1825"></a><a name="index-calc_002dsummation-1826"></a><a name="index-sum-1827"></a>The <kbd>a +</kbd> (<code>calc-summation</code>) [<code>sum</code>] command computes
the sum of a formula over a certain range of index values.  The formula
is taken from the top of the stack; the command prompts for the
name of the summation index variable, the lower limit of the
sum (any formula), and the upper limit of the sum.  If you
enter a blank line at any of these prompts, that prompt and
any later ones are answered by reading additional elements from
the stack.  Thus, <kbd>' k^2 &lt;RET&gt; ' k &lt;RET&gt; 1 &lt;RET&gt; 5 &lt;RET&gt; a + &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
produces the result 55.

   <p>The choice of index variable is arbitrary, but it's best not to
use a variable with a stored value.  In particular, while
<code>i</code> is often a favorite index variable, it should be avoided
in Calc because <code>i</code> has the imaginary constant &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(0, 1)</span></samp>&rsquo;
as a value.  If you pressed <kbd>=</kbd> on a sum over <code>i</code>, it would
be changed to a nonsensical sum over the &ldquo;variable&rdquo; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(0, 1)</span></samp>&rsquo;! 
If you really want to use <code>i</code> as an index variable, use
<kbd>s&nbsp;u&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><!-- /@w --> first to &ldquo;unstore&rdquo; this variable. 
(See <a href="Storing-Variables.html#Storing-Variables">Storing Variables</a>.)

   <p>A numeric prefix argument steps the index by that amount rather
than by one.  Thus <kbd>' a_k &lt;RET&gt; C-u -2 a + k &lt;RET&gt; 10 &lt;RET&gt; 0 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
yields &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a_10 + a_8 + a_6 + a_4 + a_2 + a_0</span></samp>&rsquo;.  A prefix
argument of plain <kbd>C-u</kbd> causes <kbd>a +</kbd> to prompt for the
step value, in which case you can enter any formula or enter
a blank line to take the step value from the stack.  With the
<kbd>C-u</kbd> prefix, <kbd>a +</kbd> can take up to five arguments from
the stack:  The formula, the variable, the lower limit, the
upper limit, and (at the top of the stack), the step value.

   <p>Calc knows how to do certain sums in closed form.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(6 k^2, k, 1, n) = 2&nbsp;n^3<!-- /@w --> + 3 n^2 + n</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In particular,
this is possible if the formula being summed is polynomial or
exponential in the index variable.  Sums of logarithms are
transformed into logarithms of products.  Sums of trigonometric
and hyperbolic functions are transformed to sums of exponentials
and then done in closed form.  Also, of course, sums in which the
lower and upper limits are both numbers can always be evaluated
just by grinding them out, although Calc will use closed forms
whenever it can for the sake of efficiency.

   <p>The notation for sums in algebraic formulas is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(</span><var>expr</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>var</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>low</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>high</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>step</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If <var>step</var> is omitted, it defaults to one.  If <var>high</var> is
omitted, <var>low</var> is actually the upper limit and the lower limit
is one.  If <var>low</var> is also omitted, the limits are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-inf</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively.

   <p>Infinite sums can sometimes be evaluated:  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(.5^k, k, 1, inf)</span></samp>&rsquo;
returns &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is done by evaluating the sum in closed
form (to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1. - 0.5^n</span></samp>&rsquo; in this case), then evaluating this
formula with <code>n</code> set to <code>inf</code>.  Calc's usual rules
for &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; arithmetic can find the answer from there.  If
infinite arithmetic yields a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nan</span></samp>&rsquo;, or if the sum cannot be
solved in closed form, Calc leaves the <code>sum</code> function in
symbolic form.  See <a href="Infinities.html#Infinities">Infinities</a>.

   <p>As a special feature, if the limits are infinite (or omitted, as
described above) but the formula includes vectors subscripted by
expressions that involve the iteration variable, Calc narrows
the limits to include only the range of integers which result in
valid subscripts for the vector.  For example, the sum
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(k [a,b,c,d,e,f,g]_(2k),k)</span></samp>&rsquo; evaluates to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b + 2 d + 3 f</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The limits of a sum do not need to be integers.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(a_k, k, 0, 2 n, n)</span></samp>&rsquo; produces &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a_0 + a_n + a_(2 n)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Calc computes the number of iterations using the formula
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 + (</span><var>high</var><span class="samp"> - </span><var>low</var><span class="samp">) / </span><var>step</var></samp>&rsquo;, which must,
after simplification as if by <kbd>a s</kbd>, evaluate to an integer.

   <p>If the number of iterations according to the above formula does
not come out to an integer, the sum is invalid and will be left
in symbolic form.  However, closed forms are still supplied, and
you are on your honor not to misuse the resulting formulas by
substituting mismatched bounds into them.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(k, k, 1, 10, 2)</span></samp>&rsquo; is invalid, but Calc will go ahead and
evaluate the closed form solution for the limits 1 and 10 to get
the rather dubious answer, 29.25.

   <p>If the lower limit is greater than the upper limit (assuming a
positive step size), the result is generally zero.  However,
Calc only guarantees a zero result when the upper limit is
exactly one step less than the lower limit, i.e., if the number
of iterations is <i>-1</i>.  Thus &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(f(k), k, n, n-1)</span></samp>&rsquo; is zero
but the sum from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n-2</span></samp>&rsquo; may report a nonzero value
if Calc used a closed form solution.

   <p>Calc's logical predicates like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a &lt; b</span></samp>&rsquo; return 1 for &ldquo;true&rdquo;
and 0 for &ldquo;false.&rdquo;  See <a href="Logical-Operations.html#Logical-Operations">Logical Operations</a>.  This can be
used to advantage for building conditional sums.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(prime(k)*k^2, k, 1, 20)</span></samp>&rsquo; is the sum of the squares of all
prime numbers from 1 to 20; the <code>prime</code> predicate returns 1 if
its argument is prime and 0 otherwise.  You can read this expression
as &ldquo;the sum of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k^2</span></samp>&rsquo;, where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo; is prime.&rdquo;  Indeed,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum(prime(k)*k^2, k)</span></samp>&rsquo; would represent the sum of <em>all</em> primes
squared, since the limits default to plus and minus infinity, but
there are no such sums that Calc's built-in rules can do in
closed form.

   <p>As another example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum((k != k_0) * f(k), k, 1, n)</span></samp>&rsquo; is the
sum of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f(k)</span></samp>&rsquo; for all &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo; from 1 to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, excluding
one value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k_0</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Slightly more tricky is the summand
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(k != k_0) / (k - k_0)</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is an attempt to describe
the sum of all &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/(k-k_0)</span></samp>&rsquo; except at &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k = k_0</span></samp>&rsquo;, where
this would be a division by zero.  But at &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k = k_0</span></samp>&rsquo;, this
formula works out to the indeterminate form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0 / 0</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
Calc will not assume is zero.  Better would be to use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(k != k_0) ? 1/(k-k_0) : 0</span></samp>&rsquo;; the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">? :</span></samp>&rsquo; operator does
an &ldquo;if-then-else&rdquo; test:  This expression says, &ldquo;if
<!-- @math{k \ne k_0}, -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k != k_0</span></samp>&rsquo;,
then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/(k-k_0)</span></samp>&rsquo;, else zero.&rdquo;  Now the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1/(k-k_0)</span></samp>&rsquo;
will not even be evaluated by Calc when &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k = k_0</span></samp>&rsquo;.

computes an alternating sum.  Successive terms of the sequence
are given alternating signs, with the first term (corresponding
to the lower index value) being positive.  Alternating sums
are converted to normal sums with an extra term of the form
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(-1)^(k-</span><var>low</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This formula is adjusted appropriately
if the step value is other than one.  For example, the Taylor
series for the sine function is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">asum(x^k / k!, k, 1, inf, 2)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(Calc cannot evaluate this infinite series, but it can approximate
it if you replace <code>inf</code> with any particular odd number.) 
Calc converts this series to a regular sum with a step of one,
namely &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sum((-1)^k x^(2k+1) / (2k+1)!, k, 0, inf)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

the analogous way to take a product of many terms.  Calc also knows
some closed forms for products, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prod(k, k, 1, n) = n!</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Conditional products can be written &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prod(k^prime(k), k, 1, n)</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prod(prime(k) ? k : 1, k, 1, n)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-a-T-1836"></a><a name="index-calc_002dtabulate-1837"></a><a name="index-table-1838"></a>The <kbd>a T</kbd> (<code>calc-tabulate</code>) [<code>table</code>] command
evaluates a formula at a series of iterated index values, just
like <code>sum</code> and <code>prod</code>, but its result is simply a
vector of the results.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">table(a_i, i, 1, 7, 2)</span></samp>&rsquo;
produces &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7]</span></samp>&rsquo;.
