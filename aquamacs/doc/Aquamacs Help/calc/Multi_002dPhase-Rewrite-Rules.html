<h4 class="subsection">11.11.8 Multi-Phase Rewrite Rules</h4>

<p class="noindent">It is possible to separate a rewrite rule set into several <dfn>phases</dfn>. 
During each phase, certain rules will be enabled while certain others
will be disabled.  A <dfn>phase schedule</dfn> controls the order in which
phases occur during the rewriting process.

   <p><a name="index-phase-1934"></a><a name="index-all-1935"></a>If a call to the marker function <code>phase</code> appears in the rules
vector in place of a rule, all rules following that point will be
members of the phase(s) identified in the arguments to <code>phase</code>. 
Phases are given integer numbers.  The markers &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phase()</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">phase(all)</span></samp>&rsquo; both mean the following rules belong to all phases;
this is the default at the start of the rule set.

   <p>If you do not explicitly schedule the phases, Calc sorts all phase
numbers that appear in the rule set and executes the phases in
ascending order.  For example, the rule set

<pre class="example">     [ f0(x) := g0(x),
       phase(1),
       f1(x) := g1(x),
       phase(2),
       f2(x) := g2(x),
       phase(3),
       f3(x) := g3(x),
       phase(1,2),
       f4(x) := g4(x) ]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">has three phases, 1 through 3.  Phase 1 consists of the <code>f0</code>,
<code>f1</code>, and <code>f4</code> rules (in that order).  Phase 2 consists of
<code>f0</code>, <code>f2</code>, and <code>f4</code>.  Phase 3 consists of <code>f0</code>
and <code>f3</code>.

   <p>When Calc rewrites a formula using this rule set, it first rewrites
the formula using only the phase 1 rules until no further changes are
possible.  Then it switches to the phase 2 rule set and continues
until no further changes occur, then finally rewrites with phase 3. 
When no more phase 3 rules apply, rewriting finishes.  (This is
assuming <kbd>a r</kbd> with a large enough prefix argument to allow the
rewriting to run to completion; the sequence just described stops
early if the number of iterations specified in the prefix argument,
100 by default, is reached.)

   <p>During each phase, Calc descends through the nested levels of the
formula as described previously.  (See <a href="Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules.html#Nested-Formulas-with-Rewrite-Rules">Nested Formulas with Rewrite Rules</a>.)  Rewriting starts at the top of the formula, then works its
way down to the parts, then goes back to the top and works down again. 
The phase 2 rules do not begin until no phase 1 rules apply anywhere
in the formula.

   <p><a name="index-schedule-1936"></a>A <code>schedule</code> marker appearing in the rule set (anywhere, but
conventionally at the top) changes the default schedule of phases. 
In the simplest case, <code>schedule</code> has a sequence of phase numbers
for arguments; each phase number is invoked in turn until the
arguments to <code>schedule</code> are exhausted.  Thus adding
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schedule(3,2,1)</span></samp>&rsquo; at the top of the above rule set would
reverse the order of the phases; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schedule(1,2,3)</span></samp>&rsquo; would have
no effect since this is the default schedule; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schedule(1,2,1,3)</span></samp>&rsquo;
would give phase 1 a second chance after phase 2 has completed, before
moving on to phase 3.

   <p>Any argument to <code>schedule</code> can instead be a vector of phase
numbers (or even of sub-vectors).  Then the sub-sequence of phases
described by the vector are tried repeatedly until no change occurs
in any phase in the sequence.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schedule([1, 2], 3)</span></samp>&rsquo;
tries phase 1, then phase 2, then, if either phase made any changes
to the formula, repeats these two phases until they can make no
further progress.  Finally, it goes on to phase 3 for finishing
touches.

   <p>Also, items in <code>schedule</code> can be variable names as well as
numbers.  A variable name is interpreted as the name of a function
to call on the whole formula.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schedule(1, simplify)</span></samp>&rsquo;
says to apply the phase-1 rules (presumably, all of them), then to
call <code>simplify</code> which is the function name equivalent of <kbd>a s</kbd>. 
Likewise, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">schedule([1, simplify])</span></samp>&rsquo; says to alternate between
phase 1 and <kbd>a s</kbd> until no further changes occur.

   <p>Phases can be used purely to improve efficiency; if it is known that
a certain group of rules will apply only at the beginning of rewriting,
and a certain other group will apply only at the end, then rewriting
will be faster if these groups are identified as separate phases. 
Once the phase 1 rules are done, Calc can put them aside and no longer
spend any time on them while it works on phase 2.

   <p>There are also some problems that can only be solved with several
rewrite phases.  For a real-world example of a multi-phase rule set,
examine the set <code>FitRules</code>, which is used by the curve-fitting
command to convert a model expression to linear form. 
See <a href="Curve-Fitting-Details.html#Curve-Fitting-Details">Curve Fitting Details</a>.  This set is divided into four phases. 
The first phase rewrites certain kinds of expressions to be more
easily linearizable, but less computationally efficient.  After the
linear components have been picked out, the final phase includes the
opposite rewrites to put each component back into an efficient form. 
If both sets of rules were included in one big phase, Calc could get
into an infinite loop going back and forth between the two forms.

   <p>Elsewhere in <code>FitRules</code>, the components are first isolated,
then recombined where possible to reduce the complexity of the linear
fit, then finally packaged one component at a time into vectors. 
If the packaging rules were allowed to begin before the recombining
rules were finished, some components might be put away into vectors
before they had a chance to recombine.  By putting these rules in
two separate phases, this problem is neatly avoided.
