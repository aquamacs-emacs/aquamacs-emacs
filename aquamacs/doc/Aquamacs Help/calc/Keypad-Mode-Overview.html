<h4 class="subsection">2.5.4 Keypad Mode (Overview)</h4>

<p class="noindent"><dfn>Keypad mode</dfn> is a mouse-based interface to the Calculator. 
It is designed for use with terminals that support a mouse.  If you
don't have a mouse, you will have to operate Keypad mode with your
arrow keys (which is probably more trouble than it's worth).

   <p>Type <kbd>C-x * k</kbd> to turn Keypad mode on or off.  Once again you
get two new windows, this time on the righthand side of the screen
instead of at the bottom.  The upper window is the familiar Calc
Stack; the lower window is a picture of a typical calculator keypad.

   <p>Keypad mode is much easier for beginners to learn, because there
is no need to memorize lots of obscure key sequences.  But not all
commands in regular Calc are available on the Keypad.  You can
always switch the cursor into the Calc stack window to use
standard Calc commands if you need.  Serious Calc users, though,
often find they prefer the standard interface over Keypad mode.

   <p>To operate the Calculator, just click on the &ldquo;buttons&rdquo; of the
keypad using your left mouse button.  To enter the two numbers
shown here you would click <kbd>1&nbsp;7&nbsp;.&nbsp;3&nbsp;ENTER&nbsp;5&nbsp;+/-&nbsp;ENTER</kbd><!-- /@w -->; to
add them together you would then click <kbd>+</kbd> (to get 12.3 on
the stack).

   <p>If you click the right mouse button, the top three rows of the
keypad change to show other sets of commands, such as advanced
math functions, vector operations, and operations on binary
numbers.

   <p>Because Keypad mode doesn't use the regular keyboard, Calc leaves
the cursor in your original editing buffer.  You can type in
this buffer in the usual way while also clicking on the Calculator
keypad.  One advantage of Keypad mode is that you don't need an
explicit command to switch between editing and calculating.

   <p>If you press <kbd>C-x * b</kbd> first, you get a full-screen Keypad mode
(<code>full-calc-keypad</code>) with three windows:  The keypad in the lower
left, the stack in the lower right, and the trail on top.
