<h3 class="section">14.2 Three-Dimensional Graphics</h3>

<p><a name="index-g-F-2098"></a><a name="index-calc_002dgraph_002dfast_002d3d-2099"></a>The <kbd>g F</kbd> (<code>calc-graph-fast-3d</code>) command makes a three-dimensional
graph.  It works only if you have GNUPLOT 3.0 or later; with GNUPLOT 2.0,
you will see a GNUPLOT error message if you try this command.

   <p>The <kbd>g F</kbd> command takes three values from the stack, called &ldquo;x&rdquo;,
&ldquo;y&rdquo;, and &ldquo;z&rdquo;, respectively.  As was the case for 2D graphs, there
are several options for these values.

   <p>In the first case, &ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo; are each vectors (not necessarily of
the same length); either or both may instead be interval forms.  The
&ldquo;z&rdquo; value must be a matrix with the same number of rows as elements
in &ldquo;x&rdquo;, and the same number of columns as elements in &ldquo;y&rdquo;.  The
result is a surface plot where
<!-- @math{z_{ij}} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z_ij</span></samp>&rsquo;
is the height of the point
at coordinate &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x_i, y_j)</span></samp>&rsquo; on the surface.  The 3D graph will
be displayed from a certain default viewpoint; you can change this
viewpoint by adding a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set view</span></samp>&rsquo; to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Gnuplot Commands*</span></samp>&rsquo;
buffer as described later.  See the GNUPLOT documentation for a
description of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set view</span></samp>&rsquo; command.

   <p>Each point in the matrix will be displayed as a dot in the graph,
and these points will be connected by a grid of lines (<dfn>isolines</dfn>).

   <p>In the second case, &ldquo;x&rdquo;, &ldquo;y&rdquo;, and &ldquo;z&rdquo; are all vectors of equal
length.  The resulting graph displays a 3D line instead of a surface,
where the coordinates of points along the line are successive triplets
of values from the input vectors.

   <p>In the third case, &ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo; are vectors or interval forms, and
&ldquo;z&rdquo; is any formula involving two variables (not counting variables
with assigned values).  These variables are sorted into alphabetical
order; the first takes on values from &ldquo;x&rdquo; and the second takes on
values from &ldquo;y&rdquo; to form a matrix of results that are graphed as a
3D surface.

   <p><a name="index-xyz-2100"></a>If the &ldquo;z&rdquo; formula evaluates to a call to the fictitious function
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xyz(</span><var>x</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>y</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>z</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the result is a
&ldquo;parametric surface.&rdquo;  In this case, the axes of the graph are
taken from the <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> values in these calls, and the
&ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo; values from the input vectors or intervals are used only
to specify the range of inputs to the formula.  For example, plotting
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0..360], [0..180], xyz(sin(x)*sin(y), cos(x)*sin(y), cos(y))</span></samp>&rsquo;
will draw a sphere.  (Since the default resolution for 3D plots is
5 steps in each of &ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo;, this will draw a very crude
sphere.  You could use the <kbd>g N</kbd> command, described below, to
increase this resolution, or specify the &ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo; values as
vectors with more than 5 elements.

   <p>It is also possible to have a function in a regular <kbd>g f</kbd> plot
evaluate to an <code>xyz</code> call.  Since <kbd>g f</kbd> plots a line, not
a surface, the result will be a 3D parametric line.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[0..720], xyz(sin(x), cos(x), x)]</span></samp>&rsquo; will plot two turns of a
helix (a three-dimensional spiral).

   <p>As for <kbd>g f</kbd>, each of &ldquo;x&rdquo;, &ldquo;y&rdquo;, and &ldquo;z&rdquo; may instead be
variables containing the relevant data.
