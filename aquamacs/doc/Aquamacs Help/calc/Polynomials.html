<h3 class="section">11.4 Polynomials</h3>

<p>A <dfn>polynomial</dfn> is a sum of terms which are coefficients times
various powers of a &ldquo;base&rdquo; variable.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x^2 + 3 x - 4</span></samp>&rsquo;
is a polynomial in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Some formulas can be considered
polynomials in several different variables:  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 + 2 x + 3 y + 4 x y^2</span></samp>&rsquo;
is a polynomial in both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Polynomial coefficients
are often numbers, but they may in general be any formulas not
involving the base variable.

   <p><a name="index-a-f-1698"></a><a name="index-calc_002dfactor-1699"></a><a name="index-factor-1700"></a>The <kbd>a f</kbd> (<code>calc-factor</code>) [<code>factor</code>] command factors a
polynomial into a product of terms.  For example, the polynomial
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^3 + 2 x^2 + x</span></samp>&rsquo; is factored into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x*(x+1)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;.  As another
example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a c + b d + b c + a d</span></samp>&rsquo; is factored into the product
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a + b) (c + d)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Calc currently has three algorithms for factoring.  Formulas which are
linear in several variables, such as the second example above, are
merged according to the distributive law.  Formulas which are
polynomials in a single variable, with constant integer or fractional
coefficients, are factored into irreducible linear and/or quadratic
terms.  The first example above factors into three linear terms
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x+1</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x+1</span></samp>&rsquo; again).  Finally, formulas
which do not fit the above criteria are handled by the algebraic
rewrite mechanism.

   <p>Calc's polynomial factorization algorithm works by using the general
root-finding command (<kbd>a&nbsp;P</kbd><!-- /@w -->) to solve for the roots of the
polynomial.  It then looks for roots which are rational numbers
or complex-conjugate pairs, and converts these into linear and
quadratic terms, respectively.  Because it uses floating-point
arithmetic, it may be unable to find terms that involve large
integers (whose number of digits approaches the current precision). 
Also, irreducible factors of degree higher than quadratic are not
found, and polynomials in more than one variable are not treated. 
(A more robust factorization algorithm may be included in a future
version of Calc.)

   <p><a name="index-FactorRules-1701"></a><a name="index-thecoefs-1702"></a><a name="index-thefactors-1703"></a>The rewrite-based factorization method uses rules stored in the variable
<code>FactorRules</code>.  See <a href="Rewrite-Rules.html#Rewrite-Rules">Rewrite Rules</a>, for a discussion of the
operation of rewrite rules.  The default <code>FactorRules</code> are able
to factor quadratic forms symbolically into two linear terms,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a x + b) (c x + d)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You can edit these rules to include other
cases if you wish.  To use the rules, Calc builds the formula
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thecoefs(x, [a, b, c, ...])</span></samp>&rsquo; where <code>x</code> is the polynomial
base variable and <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, etc., are polynomial coefficients
(which may be numbers or formulas).  The constant term is written first,
i.e., in the <code>a</code> position.  When the rules complete, they should have
changed the formula into the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">thefactors(x, [f1, f2, f3, ...])</span></samp>&rsquo;
where each <code>fi</code> should be a factored term, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x - ai</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Calc then multiplies these terms together to get the complete
factored form of the polynomial.  If the rules do not change the
<code>thecoefs</code> call to a <code>thefactors</code> call, <kbd>a f</kbd> leaves the
polynomial alone on the assumption that it is unfactorable.  (Note that
the function names <code>thecoefs</code> and <code>thefactors</code> are used only
as placeholders; there are no actual Calc functions by those names.)

   <p><a name="index-H-a-f-1704"></a><a name="index-factors-1705"></a>The <kbd>H a f</kbd> [<code>factors</code>] command also factors a polynomial,
but it returns a list of factors instead of an expression which is the
product of the factors.  Each factor is represented by a sub-vector
of the factor, and the power with which it appears.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^5 + x^4 - 33 x^3 + 63 x^2</span></samp>&rsquo; factors to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x + 7) x^2 (x - 3)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;
in <kbd>a f</kbd>, or to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ [x, 2], [x+7, 1], [x-3, 2] ]</span></samp>&rsquo; in <kbd>H a f</kbd>. 
If there is an overall numeric factor, it always comes first in the list. 
The functions <code>factor</code> and <code>factors</code> allow a second argument
when written in algebraic form; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">factor(x,v)</span></samp>&rsquo; factors &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; with
respect to the specific variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">v</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The default is to factor with
respect to all the variables that appear in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-a-c-1706"></a><a name="index-calc_002dcollect-1707"></a><a name="index-collect-1708"></a>The <kbd>a c</kbd> (<code>calc-collect</code>) [<code>collect</code>] command rearranges a
formula as a
polynomial in a given variable, ordered in decreasing powers of that
variable.  For example, given &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 + 2 x + 3 y + 4 x y^2</span></samp>&rsquo; on
the stack, <kbd>a c x</kbd> would produce &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(2 + 4 y^2) x + (1 + 3 y)</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and <kbd>a c y</kbd> would produce &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(4 x) y^2 + 3 y + (1 + 2 x)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The polynomial will be expanded out using the distributive law as
necessary:  Collecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x - 1)^3</span></samp>&rsquo; produces
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^3 - 3 x^2 + 3 x - 1</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Terms not involving &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; will
not be expanded.

   <p>The &ldquo;variable&rdquo; you specify at the prompt can actually be any
expression: <kbd>a c ln(x+1)</kbd> will collect together all terms multiplied
by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln(x+1)</span></samp>&rsquo; or integer powers thereof.  If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; also appears
in the formula in a context other than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln(x+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;, <kbd>a c</kbd> will
treat those occurrences as unrelated to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln(x+1)</span></samp>&rsquo;, i.e., as constants.

   <p><a name="index-a-x-1709"></a><a name="index-calc_002dexpand-1710"></a><a name="index-expand-1711"></a>The <kbd>a x</kbd> (<code>calc-expand</code>) [<code>expand</code>] command expands an
expression by applying the distributive law everywhere.  It applies to
products, quotients, and powers involving sums.  By default, it fully
distributes all parts of the expression.  With a numeric prefix argument,
the distributive law is applied only the specified number of times, then
the partially expanded expression is left on the stack.

   <p>The <kbd>a x</kbd> and <kbd>j D</kbd> commands are somewhat redundant.  Use
<kbd>a x</kbd> if you want to expand all products of sums in your formula. 
Use <kbd>j D</kbd> if you want to expand a particular specified term of
the formula.  There is an exactly analogous correspondence between
<kbd>a f</kbd> and <kbd>j M</kbd>.  (The <kbd>j D</kbd> and <kbd>j M</kbd> commands
also know many other kinds of expansions, such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(a + b) = exp(a) exp(b)</span></samp>&rsquo;, which <kbd>a x</kbd> and <kbd>a f</kbd>
do not do.)

   <p>Calc's automatic simplifications will sometimes reverse a partial
expansion.  For example, the first step in expanding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x+1)^3</span></samp>&rsquo; is
to write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x+1) (x+1)^2</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If <kbd>a x</kbd> stops there and tries
to put this formula onto the stack, though, Calc will automatically
simplify it back to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x+1)^3</span></samp>&rsquo; form.  The solution is to turn
simplification off first (see <a href="Simplification-Modes.html#Simplification-Modes">Simplification Modes</a>), or to run
<kbd>a x</kbd> without a numeric prefix argument so that it expands all
the way in one step.

   <p><a name="index-a-a-1712"></a><a name="index-calc_002dapart-1713"></a><a name="index-apart-1714"></a>The <kbd>a a</kbd> (<code>calc-apart</code>) [<code>apart</code>] command expands a
rational function by partial fractions.  A rational function is the
quotient of two polynomials; <code>apart</code> pulls this apart into a
sum of rational functions with simple denominators.  In algebraic
notation, the <code>apart</code> function allows a second argument that
specifies which variable to use as the &ldquo;base&rdquo;; by default, Calc
chooses the base variable automatically.

   <p><a name="index-a-n-1715"></a><a name="index-calc_002dnormalize_002drat-1716"></a><a name="index-nrat-1717"></a>The <kbd>a n</kbd> (<code>calc-normalize-rat</code>) [<code>nrat</code>] command
attempts to arrange a formula into a quotient of two polynomials. 
For example, given &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 + (a + b/c) / d</span></samp>&rsquo;, the result would be
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(b + a c + c d) / c d</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The quotient is reduced, so that
<kbd>a n</kbd> will simplify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x^2 + 2x + 1) / (x^2 - 1)</span></samp>&rsquo; by dividing
out the common factor &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + 1</span></samp>&rsquo;, yielding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x + 1) / (x - 1)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-a-_005c-1718"></a><a name="index-calc_002dpoly_002ddiv-1719"></a><a name="index-pdiv-1720"></a>The <kbd>a \</kbd> (<code>calc-poly-div</code>) [<code>pdiv</code>] command divides
two polynomials &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">v</span></samp>&rsquo;, yielding a new polynomial
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If several variables occur in the inputs, the inputs are
considered multivariate polynomials.  (Calc divides by the variable
with the largest power in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u</span></samp>&rsquo; first, or, in the case of equal
powers, chooses the variables in alphabetical order.)  For example,
dividing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2 + 3 x + 2</span></samp>&rsquo; by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + 2</span></samp>&rsquo; yields &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x + 1</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The remainder from the division, if any, is reported at the bottom
of the screen and is also placed in the Trail along with the quotient.

   <p>Using <code>pdiv</code> in algebraic notation, you can specify the particular
variable to be used as the base: <code>pdiv(</code><var>a</var><code>,</code><var>b</var><code>,</code><var>x</var><code>)</code>. 
If <code>pdiv</code> is given only two arguments (as is always the case with
the <kbd>a \</kbd> command), then it does a multivariate division as outlined
above.

   <p><a name="index-a-_0025-1721"></a><a name="index-calc_002dpoly_002drem-1722"></a><a name="index-prem-1723"></a>The <kbd>a %</kbd> (<code>calc-poly-rem</code>) [<code>prem</code>] command divides
two polynomials and keeps the remainder &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The quotient
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo; is discarded.  For any formulas &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, the
results of <kbd>a \</kbd> and <kbd>a %</kbd> satisfy &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a = q b + r</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(This is analogous to plain <kbd>\</kbd> and <kbd>%</kbd>, which compute the
integer quotient and remainder from dividing two numbers.)

   <p><a name="index-a-_002f-1724"></a><a name="index-H-a-_002f-1725"></a><a name="index-calc_002dpoly_002ddiv_002drem-1726"></a><a name="index-pdivrem-1727"></a><a name="index-pdivide-1728"></a>The <kbd>a /</kbd> (<code>calc-poly-div-rem</code>) [<code>pdivrem</code>] command
divides two polynomials and reports both the quotient and the
remainder as a vector &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[q, r]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The <kbd>H a /</kbd> [<code>pdivide</code>]
command divides two polynomials and constructs the formula
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q + r/b</span></samp>&rsquo; on the stack.  (Naturally if the remainder is zero,
this will immediately simplify to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

   <p><a name="index-a-g-1729"></a><a name="index-calc_002dpoly_002dgcd-1730"></a><a name="index-pgcd-1731"></a>The <kbd>a g</kbd> (<code>calc-poly-gcd</code>) [<code>pgcd</code>] command computes
the greatest common divisor of two polynomials.  (The GCD actually
is unique only to within a constant multiplier; Calc attempts to
choose a GCD which will be unsurprising.)  For example, the <kbd>a n</kbd>
command uses <kbd>a g</kbd> to take the GCD of the numerator and denominator
of a quotient, then divides each by the result using <kbd>a \</kbd>.  (The
definition of GCD ensures that this division can take place without
leaving a remainder.)

   <p>While the polynomials used in operations like <kbd>a /</kbd> and <kbd>a g</kbd>
often have integer coefficients, this is not required.  Calc can also
deal with polynomials over the rationals or floating-point reals. 
Polynomials with modulo-form coefficients are also useful in many
applications; if you enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(x^2 + 3 x - 1) mod 5</span></samp>&rsquo;, Calc
automatically transforms this into a polynomial over the field of
integers mod 5:  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(1 mod 5) x^2 + (3 mod 5) x + (4 mod 5)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Congratulations and thanks go to Ove Ewerlid

polynomial routines used in the above commands.
