<h3 class="section">5.5 Infinities</h3>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-Infinity-242"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binf_007d-variable-243"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007buinf_007d-variable-244"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bnan_007d-variable-245"></a><a name="index-inf-246"></a><a name="index-uinf-247"></a><a name="index-nan-248"></a>The word <code>inf</code> represents the mathematical concept of <dfn>infinity</dfn>. 
Calc actually has three slightly different infinity-like values:
<code>inf</code>, <code>uinf</code>, and <code>nan</code>.  These are just regular
variable names (see <a href="Variables.html#Variables">Variables</a>); you should avoid using these
names for your own variables because Calc gives them special
treatment.  Infinities, like all variable names, are normally
entered using algebraic entry.

   <p>Mathematically speaking, it is not rigorously correct to treat
&ldquo;infinity&rdquo; as if it were a number, but mathematicians often do
so informally.  When they say that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / inf = 0</span></samp>&rsquo;, what they
really mean is that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / x</span></samp>&rsquo;, as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; becomes larger and
larger, becomes arbitrarily close to zero.  So you can imagine
that if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; got &ldquo;all the way to infinity,&rdquo; then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / x</span></samp>&rsquo;
would go all the way to zero.  Similarly, when they say that
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(inf) = inf</span></samp>&rsquo;, they mean that
<!-- @math{e^x} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
grows without bound as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; grows.  The symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-inf</span></samp>&rsquo; likewise
stands for an infinitely negative real value; for example, we say that
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exp(-inf) = 0</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You can have an infinity pointing in any
direction on the complex plane:  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(-inf) = i inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The same concept of limits can be used to define &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0</span></samp>&rsquo;.  We
really want the value that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / x</span></samp>&rsquo; approaches as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;
approaches zero.  But if all we have is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0</span></samp>&rsquo;, we can't
tell which direction &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; was coming from.  If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; was
positive and decreasing toward zero, then we should say that
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0 = inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.  But if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; was negative and increasing
toward zero, the answer is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0 = -inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In fact, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;
could be an imaginary number, giving the answer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i inf</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-i inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Calc uses the special symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">uinf</span></samp>&rsquo; to mean
<dfn>undirected infinity</dfn>, i.e., a value which is infinitely
large but with an unknown sign (or direction on the complex plane).

   <p>Calc actually has three modes that say how infinities are handled. 
Normally, infinities never arise from calculations that didn't
already have them.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0</span></samp>&rsquo; is treated simply as an
error and left unevaluated.  The <kbd>m i</kbd> (<code>calc-infinite-mode</code>)
command (see <a href="Infinite-Mode.html#Infinite-Mode">Infinite Mode</a>) enables a mode in which
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0</span></samp>&rsquo; evaluates to <code>uinf</code> instead.  There is also
an alternative type of infinite mode which says to treat zeros
as if they were positive, so that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1 / 0 = inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.  While this
is less mathematically correct, it may be the answer you want in
some cases.

   <p>Since all infinities are &ldquo;as large&rdquo; as all others, Calc simplifies,
e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5 inf</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Another example is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">5 - inf = -inf</span></samp>&rsquo;, where the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-inf</span></samp>&rsquo; is so large that
adding a finite number like five to it does not affect it. 
Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a - inf</span></samp>&rsquo; also results in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-inf</span></samp>&rsquo;; Calc assumes
that variables like <code>a</code> always stand for finite quantities. 
Just to show that infinities really are all the same size,
note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(inf) = inf^2 = exp(inf) = inf</span></samp>&rsquo; in Calc's
notation.

   <p>It's not so easy to define certain formulas like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0 * inf</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf / inf</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Depending on where these zeros and infinities
came from, the answer could be literally anything.  The latter
formula could be the limit of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x / x</span></samp>&rsquo; (giving a result of one),
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2 x / x</span></samp>&rsquo; (giving two), or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2 / x</span></samp>&rsquo; (giving <code>inf</code>),
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x / x^2</span></samp>&rsquo; (giving zero).  Calc uses the symbol <code>nan</code>
to represent such an <dfn>indeterminate</dfn> value.  (The name &ldquo;nan&rdquo;
comes from analogy with the &ldquo;NAN&rdquo; concept of IEEE standard
arithmetic; it stands for &ldquo;Not A Number.&rdquo;  This is somewhat of a
misnomer, since <code>nan</code> <em>does</em> stand for some number or
infinity, it's just that <em>which</em> number it stands for
cannot be determined.)  In Calc's notation, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0 * inf = nan</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf / inf = nan</span></samp>&rsquo;.  A few other common indeterminate
expressions are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf - inf</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inf ^ 0</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Also,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0 / 0 = nan</span></samp>&rsquo; if you have turned on Infinite mode
(as described above).

   <p>Infinities are especially useful as parts of <dfn>intervals</dfn>.
