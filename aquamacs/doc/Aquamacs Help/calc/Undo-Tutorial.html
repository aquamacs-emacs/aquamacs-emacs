<h4 class="subsection">3.1.3 Undo and Redo</h4>

<p class="noindent">If you make a mistake, you can usually correct it by pressing shift-<kbd>U</kbd>,
the &ldquo;undo&rdquo; command.  First, clear the stack (<kbd>M-0 &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>) and exit
and restart Calc (<kbd>C-x * * C-x * *</kbd>) to make sure things start off
with a clean slate.  Now:

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  2          2:  2          1:  8          2:  2          1:  6
         .          1:  3              .          1:  3              .
                        .                             .
     
        2 &lt;RET&gt;           3              ^              U              *
</pre>
   <p>You can undo any number of times.  Calc keeps a complete record of
all you have done since you last opened the Calc window.  After the
above example, you could type:

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  6          2:  2          1:  2              .              .
         .          1:  3              .
                        .
                                                                  (error)
                        U              U              U              U
</pre>
   <p>You can also type <kbd>D</kbd> to &ldquo;redo&rdquo; a command that you have undone
mistakenly.

<pre class="smallexample">         .          1:  2          2:  2          1:  6          1:  6
                        .          1:  3              .              .
                                       .
                                                                  (error)
                        D              D              D              D
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It was not possible to redo past the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">6</span></samp>&rsquo;, since that was placed there
by something other than an undo command.

   <p><a name="index-Time-travel-17"></a>You can think of undo and redo as a sort of &ldquo;time machine.&rdquo;  Press
<kbd>U</kbd> to go backward in time, <kbd>D</kbd> to go forward.  If you go
backward and do something (like <kbd>*</kbd>) then, as any science fiction
reader knows, you have changed your future and you cannot go forward
again.  Thus, the inability to redo past the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">6</span></samp>&rsquo; even though there
was an earlier undo command.

   <p>You can always recall an earlier result using the Trail.  We've ignored
the trail so far, but it has been faithfully recording everything we
did since we loaded the Calculator.  If the Trail is not displayed,
press <kbd>t d</kbd> now to turn it on.

   <p>Let's try grabbing an earlier result.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8</span></samp>&rsquo; we computed was
undone by a <kbd>U</kbd> command, and was lost even to Redo when we pressed
<kbd>*</kbd>, but it's still there in the trail.  There should be a little
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; arrow (the <dfn>trail pointer</dfn>) resting on the last trail
entry.  If there isn't, press <kbd>t ]</kbd> to reset the trail pointer. 
Now, press <kbd>t&nbsp;p</kbd><!-- /@w --> to move the arrow onto the line containing
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8</span></samp>&rsquo;, and press <kbd>t&nbsp;y</kbd><!-- /@w --> to &ldquo;yank&rdquo; that number back onto the
stack.

   <p>If you press <kbd>t ]</kbd> again, you will see that even our Yank command
went into the trail.

   <p>Let's go further back in time.  Earlier in the tutorial we computed
a huge integer using the formula &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2^3^4</span></samp>&rsquo;.  We don't remember
what it was, but the first digits were &ldquo;241&rdquo;.  Press <kbd>t r</kbd>
(which stands for trail-search-reverse), then type <kbd>241</kbd>. 
The trail cursor will jump back to the next previous occurrence of
the string &ldquo;241&rdquo; in the trail.  This is just a regular Emacs
incremental search; you can now press <kbd>C-s</kbd> or <kbd>C-r</kbd> to
continue the search forwards or backwards as you like.

   <p>To finish the search, press &lt;RET&gt;.  This halts the incremental
search and leaves the trail pointer at the thing we found.  Now we
can type <kbd>t y</kbd> to yank that number onto the stack.  If we hadn't
remembered the &ldquo;241&rdquo;, we could simply have searched for <kbd>2^3^4</kbd>,
then pressed <kbd>&lt;RET&gt; t n</kbd> to halt and then move to the next item.

   <p>You may have noticed that all the trail-related commands begin with
the letter <kbd>t</kbd>.  (The store-and-recall commands, on the other hand,
all began with <kbd>s</kbd>.)  Calc has so many commands that there aren't
enough keys for all of them, so various commands are grouped into
two-letter sequences where the first letter is called the <dfn>prefix</dfn>
key.  If you type a prefix key by accident, you can press <kbd>C-g</kbd>
to cancel it.  (In fact, you can press <kbd>C-g</kbd> to cancel almost
anything in Emacs.)  To get help on a prefix key, press that key
followed by <kbd>?</kbd>.  Some prefixes have several lines of help,
so you need to press <kbd>?</kbd> repeatedly to see them all. 
You can also type <kbd>h h</kbd> to see all the help at once.

   <p>Try pressing <kbd>t ?</kbd> now.  You will see a line of the form,

<pre class="smallexample">     trail/time: Display; Fwd, Back; Next, Prev, Here, [, ]; Yank:  [MORE]  t-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The word &ldquo;trail&rdquo; indicates that the <kbd>t</kbd> prefix key contains
trail-related commands.  Each entry on the line shows one command,
with a single capital letter showing which letter you press to get
that command.  We have used <kbd>t n</kbd>, <kbd>t p</kbd>, <kbd>t ]</kbd>, and
<kbd>t y</kbd> so far.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[MORE]</span></samp>&rsquo; means you can press <kbd>?</kbd>
again to see more <kbd>t</kbd>-prefix commands.  Notice that the commands
are roughly divided (by semicolons) into related groups.

   <p>When you are in the help display for a prefix key, the prefix is
still active.  If you press another key, like <kbd>y</kbd> for example,
it will be interpreted as a <kbd>t y</kbd> command.  If all you wanted
was to look at the help messages, press <kbd>C-g</kbd> afterwards to cancel
the prefix.

   <p>One more way to correct an error is by editing the stack entries. 
The actual Stack buffer is marked read-only and must not be edited
directly, but you can press <kbd>`</kbd> (the backquote or accent grave)
to edit a stack entry.

   <p>Try entering &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3.141439</span></samp>&rsquo; now.  If this is supposed to represent
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pi</span></samp>&rsquo;, it's got several errors.  Press <kbd>`</kbd> to edit this number. 
Now use the normal Emacs cursor motion and editing keys to change
the second 4 to a 5, and to transpose the 3 and the 9.  When you
press &lt;RET&gt;, the number on the stack will be replaced by your
new number.  This works for formulas, vectors, and all other types
of values you can put on the stack.  The <kbd>`</kbd> key also works
during entry of a number or algebraic formula.
