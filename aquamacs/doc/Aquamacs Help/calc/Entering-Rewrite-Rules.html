<h4 class="subsection">11.11.1 Entering Rewrite Rules</h4>

<p class="noindent">Rewrite rules normally use the &ldquo;assignment&rdquo; operator
&lsquo;<samp><var>old</var><span class="samp"> := </span><var>new</var></samp>&rsquo;. 
This operator is equivalent to the function call &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">assign(old, new)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The <code>assign</code> function is undefined by itself in Calc, so an
assignment formula such as a rewrite rule will be left alone by ordinary
Calc commands.  But certain commands, like the rewrite system, interpret
assignments in special ways.

   <p>For example, the rule &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x)^2 := 1-cos(x)^2</span></samp>&rsquo; says to replace
every occurrence of the sine of something, squared, with one minus the
square of the cosine of that same thing.  All by itself as a formula
on the stack it does nothing, but when given to the <kbd>a r</kbd> command
it turns that command into a sine-squared-to-cosine-squared converter.

   <p>To specify a set of rules to be applied all at once, make a vector of
rules.

   <p>When <kbd>a r</kbd> prompts you to enter the rewrite rules, you can answer
in several ways:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>With a rule:  <kbd>f(x) := g(x) &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
<li>With a vector of rules:  <kbd>[f1(x) := g1(x), f2(x) := g2(x)] &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
(You can omit the enclosing square brackets if you wish.) 
<li>With the name of a variable that contains the rule or rules vector:
<kbd>myrules &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
<li>With any formula except a rule, a vector, or a variable name; this
will be interpreted as the <var>old</var> half of a rewrite rule,
and you will be prompted a second time for the <var>new</var> half:
<kbd>f(x) &lt;RET&gt; g(x) &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
<li>With a blank line, in which case the rule, rules vector, or variable
will be taken from the top of the stack (and the formula to be
rewritten will come from the second-to-top position).
        </ol>

   <p>If you enter the rules directly (as opposed to using rules stored
in a variable), those rules will be put into the Trail so that you
can retrieve them later.  See <a href="Trail-Commands.html#Trail-Commands">Trail Commands</a>.

   <p>It is most convenient to store rules you use often in a variable and
invoke them by giving the variable name.  The <kbd>s e</kbd>
(<code>calc-edit-variable</code>) command is an easy way to create or edit a
rule set stored in a variable.  You may also wish to use <kbd>s p</kbd>
(<code>calc-permanent-variable</code>) to save your rules permanently;
see <a href="Operations-on-Variables.html#Operations-on-Variables">Operations on Variables</a>.

   <p>Rewrite rules are compiled into a special internal form for faster
matching.  If you enter a rule set directly it must be recompiled
every time.  If you store the rules in a variable and refer to them
through that variable, they will be compiled once and saved away
along with the variable for later reference.  This is another good
reason to store your rules in a variable.

   <p>Calc also accepts an obsolete notation for rules, as vectors
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span><var>old</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>new</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  But because it is easily confused with a
vector of two rules, the use of this notation is no longer recommended.
