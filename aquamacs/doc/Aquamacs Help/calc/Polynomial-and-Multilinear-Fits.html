<h4 class="subsection">11.8.2 Polynomial and Multilinear Fits</h4>

<p class="noindent">To fit the data to higher-order polynomials, just type one of the
digits <kbd>2</kbd> through <kbd>9</kbd> when prompted for a model.  For example,
we could fit the original data matrix from the previous section
(with 13, not 14) to a parabola instead of a line by typing
<kbd>a F 2 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

<pre class="example">     2.00000000001 x - 1.5e-12 x^2 + 2.99999999999
</pre>
   <p>Note that since the constant and linear terms are enough to fit the
data exactly, it's no surprise that Calc chose a tiny contribution
for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (The fact that it's not exactly zero is due only
to roundoff error.  Since our data are exact integers, we could get
an exact answer by typing <kbd>m f</kbd> first to get Fraction mode. 
Then the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo; term would vanish altogether.  Usually, though,
the data being fitted will be approximate floats so Fraction mode
won't help.)

   <p>Doing the <kbd>a F 2</kbd> fit on the data set with 14 instead of 13
gives a much larger &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x^2</span></samp>&rsquo; contribution, as Calc bends the
line slightly to improve the fit.

<pre class="example">     0.142857142855 x^2 + 1.34285714287 x + 3.59999999998
</pre>
   <p>An important result from the theory of polynomial fitting is that it
is always possible to fit <var>n</var> data points exactly using a polynomial
of degree <var>n</var><i>-1</i>, sometimes called an <dfn>interpolating polynomial</dfn>. 
Using the modified (14) data matrix, a model number of 4 gives
a polynomial that exactly matches all five data points:

<pre class="example">     0.04167 x^4 - 0.4167 x^3 + 1.458 x^2 - 0.08333 x + 4.
</pre>
   <p>The actual coefficients we get with a precision of 12, like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0.0416666663588</span></samp>&rsquo;, clearly suffer from loss of precision. 
It is a good idea to increase the working precision to several
digits beyond what you need when you do a fitting operation. 
Or, if your data are exact, use Fraction mode to get exact
results.

   <p>You can type <kbd>i</kbd> instead of a digit at the model prompt to fit
the data exactly to a polynomial.  This just counts the number of
columns of the data matrix to choose the degree of the polynomial
automatically.

   <p>Fitting data &ldquo;exactly&rdquo; to high-degree polynomials is not always
a good idea, though.  High-degree polynomials have a tendency to
wiggle uncontrollably in between the fitting data points.  Also,
if the exact-fit polynomial is going to be used to interpolate or
extrapolate the data, it is numerically better to use the <kbd>a p</kbd>
command described below.  See <a href="Interpolation.html#Interpolation">Interpolation</a>.

   <p>Another generalization of the linear model is to assume the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; values are a sum of linear contributions from several
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; values.  This is a <dfn>multilinear</dfn> fit, and it is also
selected by the <kbd>1</kbd> digit key.  (Calc decides whether the fit
is linear or multilinear by counting the rows in the data matrix.)

   <p>Given the data matrix,

<pre class="example">     [ [  1,   2,   3,    4,   5  ]
       [  7,   2,   3,    5,   2  ]
       [ 14.5, 15, 18.5, 22.5, 24 ] ]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the command <kbd>a F 1 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> will call the first row &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and the
second row &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;, and will fit the values in the third row to the
model &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b x + c y</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<pre class="example">     8. + 3. x + 0.5 y
</pre>
   <p>Calc can do multilinear fits with any number of independent variables
(i.e., with any number of data rows).

   <p>Yet another variation is <dfn>homogeneous</dfn> linear models, in which
the constant term is known to be zero.  In the linear case, this
means the model formula is simply &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x</span></samp>&rsquo;; in the multilinear
case, the model might be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x + b y + c z</span></samp>&rsquo;; and in the polynomial
case, the model could be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a x + b x^2 + c x^3</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You can get
a homogeneous linear or multilinear model by pressing the letter
<kbd>h</kbd> followed by a regular model key, like <kbd>1</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd>. 
This will be indicated by an &ldquo;h&rdquo; in the minibuffer after the help
message.

   <p>It is certainly possible to have other constrained linear models,
like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2.3 + a x</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a - 4 x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  While there is no single
key to select models like these, a later section shows how to enter
any desired model by hand.  In the first case, for example, you
would enter <kbd>a F ' 2.3 + a x</kbd>.

   <p>Another class of models that will work but must be entered by hand
are multinomial fits, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a + b x + c y + d x^2 + e y^2 + f x y</span></samp>&rsquo;.
