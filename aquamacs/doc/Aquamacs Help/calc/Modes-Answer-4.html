<h4 class="subsection">3.7.11 Modes Tutorial Exercise 4</h4>

<p class="noindent">Many calculations involve real-world quantities, like the width and
height of a piece of wood or the volume of a jar.  Such quantities
can't be measured exactly anyway, and if the data that is input to
a calculation is inexact, doing exact arithmetic on it is a waste
of time.

   <p>Fractions become unwieldy after too many calculations have been
done with them.  For example, the sum of the reciprocals of the
integers from 1 to 10 is 7381:2520.  The sum from 1 to 30 is
9304682830147:2329089562800.  After a point it will take a long
time to add even one more term to this sum, but a floating-point
calculation of the sum will not have this problem.

   <p>Also, rational numbers cannot express the results of all calculations. 
There is no fractional form for the square root of two, so if you type
<kbd>2&nbsp;Q</kbd><!-- /@w -->, Calc has no choice but to give you a floating-point answer.
