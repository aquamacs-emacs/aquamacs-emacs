<h4 class="subsection">3.5.1 Basic Algebra</h4>

<p class="noindent">If you enter a formula in Algebraic mode that refers to variables,
the formula itself is pushed onto the stack.  You can manipulate
formulas as regular data objects.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  2 x^2 - 6       1:  6 - 2 x^2       1:  (6 - 2 x^2) (3 x^2 + y)
         .                   .                   .
     
         ' 2x^2-6 &lt;RET&gt;        n                   ' 3x^2+y &lt;RET&gt; *
</pre>
   <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 1.</strong>  Do <kbd>' x &lt;RET&gt; Q 2 ^</kbd> and
<kbd>' x &lt;RET&gt; 2 ^ Q</kbd> both wind up with the same result (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;)? 
Why or why not?  See <a href="Algebra-Answer-1.html#Algebra-Answer-1">1</a>. (&bull;)

   <p>There are also commands for doing common algebraic operations on
formulas.  Continuing with the formula from the last example,

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  18 x^2 + 6 y - 6 x^4 - 2 x^2 y    1:  (18 - 2 y) x^2 - 6 x^4 + 6 y
         .                                     .
     
         a x                                   a c x &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">First we &ldquo;expand&rdquo; using the distributive law, then we &ldquo;collect&rdquo;
terms involving like powers of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Let's find the value of this expression when &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is 2 and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;
is one-half.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3      1:  -25
         .                           .
     
         1:2 s l y &lt;RET&gt;               2 s l x &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <kbd>s l</kbd> command means &ldquo;let&rdquo;; it takes a number from the top of
the stack and temporarily assigns it as the value of the variable
you specify.  It then evaluates (as if by the <kbd>=</kbd> key) the
next expression on the stack.  After this command, the variable goes
back to its original value, if any.

   <p>(An earlier exercise in this tutorial involved storing a value in the
variable <code>x</code>; if this value is still there, you will have to
unstore it with <kbd>s u x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> before the above example will work
properly.)

   <p><a name="index-Maximum-of-a-function-using-Calculus-63"></a>Let's find the maximum value of our original expression when &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;
is one-half and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; ranges over all possible values.  We can
do this by taking the derivative with respect to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and examining
values of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; for which the derivative is zero.  If the second
derivative of the function at that value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is negative,
the function has a local maximum there.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3      1:  34 x - 24 x^3
         .                           .
     
         U &lt;DEL&gt;  s 1                  a d x &lt;RET&gt;   s 2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Well, the derivative is clearly zero when &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; is zero.  To find
the other root(s), let's divide through by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and then solve:

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  (34 x - 24 x^3) / x    1:  34 x / x - 24 x^3 / x    1:  34 - 24 x^2
         .                          .                            .
     
         ' x &lt;RET&gt; /                  a x                          a s
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">
<pre class="smallexample">     1:  34 - 24 x^2 = 0        1:  x = 1.19023
         .                          .
     
         0 a =  s 3                 a S x &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Notice the use of <kbd>a s</kbd> to &ldquo;simplify&rdquo; the formula.  When the
default algebraic simplifications don't do enough, you can use
<kbd>a s</kbd> to tell Calc to spend more time on the job.

   <p>Now we compute the second derivative and plug in our values of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;:

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  1.19023        2:  1.19023         2:  1.19023
         .              1:  34 x - 24 x^3   1:  34 - 72 x^2
                            .                   .
     
         a .                r 2                 a d x &lt;RET&gt; s 4
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(The <kbd>a .</kbd> command extracts just the righthand side of an equation. 
Another method would have been to use <kbd>v u</kbd> to unpack the equation
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.19</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.19</span></samp>&rsquo;, then use <kbd>M-- M-2 &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>
to delete the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  34 - 72 x^2   1:  -68.         2:  34 - 72 x^2     1:  34
     1:  1.19023           .            1:  0                   .
         .                                  .
     
         &lt;TAB&gt;               s l x &lt;RET&gt;        U &lt;DEL&gt; 0             s l x &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first of these second derivatives is negative, so we know the function
has a maximum value at &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x = 1.19023</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (The function also has a
local <em>minimum</em> at &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x = 0</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

   <p>When we solved for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;, we got only one value even though
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">34 - 24 x^2 = 0</span></samp>&rsquo; is a quadratic equation that ought to have
two solutions.  The reason is that <kbd>a&nbsp;S</kbd><!-- /@w --> normally returns a
single &ldquo;principal&rdquo; solution.  If it needs to come up with an
arbitrary sign (as occurs in the quadratic formula) it picks &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If it needs an arbitrary integer, it picks zero.  We can get a full
solution by pressing <kbd>H</kbd> (the Hyperbolic flag) before <kbd>a S</kbd>.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  34 - 24 x^2 = 0    1:  x = 1.19023 s1      1:  x = -1.19023
         .                      .                       .
     
         r 3                    H a S x &lt;RET&gt;  s 5        1 n  s l s1 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Calc has invented the variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s1</span></samp>&rsquo; to represent an unknown sign;
it is supposed to be either <i>+1</i> or <i>-1</i>.  Here we have used
the &ldquo;let&rdquo; command to evaluate the expression when the sign is negative. 
If we plugged this into our second derivative we would get the same,
negative, answer, so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x = -1.19023</span></samp>&rsquo; is also a maximum.

   <p>To find the actual maximum value, we must plug our two values of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;
into the original formula.

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3    1:  24.08333 s1^2 - 12.04166 s1^4 + 3
     1:  x = 1.19023 s1            .
         .
     
         r 1 r 5                   s l &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Here we see another way to use <kbd>s l</kbd>; if its input is an equation
with a variable on the lefthand side, then <kbd>s l</kbd> treats the equation
like an assignment to that variable if you don't give a variable name.)

   <p>It's clear that this will have the same value for either sign of
<code>s1</code>, but let's work it out anyway, just for the exercise:

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  [-1, 1]              1:  [15.04166, 15.04166]
     1:  24.08333 s1^2 ...        .
         .
     
       [ 1 n , 1 ] &lt;TAB&gt;            V M $ &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here we have used a vector mapping operation to evaluate the function
at several values of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s1</span></samp>&rsquo; at once.  <kbd>V M $</kbd> is like <kbd>V M '</kbd>
except that it takes the formula from the top of the stack.  The
formula is interpreted as a function to apply across the vector at the
next-to-top stack level.  Since a formula on the stack can't contain
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; signs, Calc assumes the variables in the formula stand for
different arguments.  It prompts you for an <dfn>argument list</dfn>, giving
the list of all variables in the formula in alphabetical order as the
default list.  In this case the default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(s1)</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is just
what we want so we simply press &lt;RET&gt; at the prompt.

   <p>If there had been several different values, we could have used
<kbd>V&nbsp;R&nbsp;X</kbd><!-- /@w --> to find the global maximum.

   <p>Calc has a built-in <kbd>a P</kbd> command that solves an equation using
<kbd>H&nbsp;a&nbsp;S</kbd><!-- /@w --> and returns a vector of all the solutions.  It simply
automates the job we just did by hand.  Applied to our original
cubic polynomial, it would produce the vector of solutions
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1.19023, -1.19023, 0]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (There is also an <kbd>a X</kbd> command
which finds a local maximum of a function.  It uses a numerical search
method rather than examining the derivatives, and thus requires you
to provide some kind of initial guess to show it where to look.)

   <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 2.</strong>  Given a vector of the roots of a
polynomial (such as the output of an <kbd>a P</kbd> command), what
sequence of commands would you use to reconstruct the original
polynomial?  (The answer will be unique to within a constant
multiple; choose the solution where the leading coefficient is one.) 
See <a href="Algebra-Answer-2.html#Algebra-Answer-2">2</a>. (&bull;)

   <p>The <kbd>m s</kbd> command enables Symbolic mode, in which formulas
like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(5)</span></samp>&rsquo; that can't be evaluated exactly are left in
symbolic form rather than giving a floating-point approximate answer. 
Fraction mode (<kbd>m f</kbd>) is also useful when doing algebra.

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  34 x - 24 x^3        2:  34 x - 24 x^3
     1:  34 x - 24 x^3        1:  [sqrt(51) / 6, sqrt(51) / -6, 0]
         .                        .
     
         r 2  &lt;RET&gt;     m s  m f    a P x &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p>One more mode that makes reading formulas easier is Big mode.

<pre class="smallexample">                    3
     2:  34 x - 24 x
     
           ____   ____
          V 51   V 51
     1:  [-----, -----, 0]
            6     -6
     
         .
     
         d B
</pre>
   <p>Here things like powers, square roots, and quotients and fractions
are displayed in a two-dimensional pictorial form.  Calc has other
language modes as well, such as C mode, FORTRAN mode, TeX mode
and LaTeX mode.

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  34*x - 24*pow(x, 3)               2:  34*x - 24*x**3
     1:  {sqrt(51) / 6, sqrt(51) / -6, 0}  1:  /sqrt(51) / 6, sqrt(51) / -6, 0/
         .                                     .
     
         d C                                   d F
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">
<pre class="smallexample">     3:  34 x - 24 x^3
     2:  [{\sqrt{51} \over 6}, {\sqrt{51} \over -6}, 0]
     1:  {2 \over 3} \sqrt{5}
         .
     
         d T   ' 2 \sqrt{5} \over 3 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As you can see, language modes affect both entry and display of
formulas.  They affect such things as the names used for built-in
functions, the set of arithmetic operators and their precedences,
and notations for vectors and matrices.

   <p>Notice that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(51)</span></samp>&rsquo; may cause problems with older
implementations of C and FORTRAN, which would require something more
like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sqrt(51.0)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It is always wise to check over the formulas
produced by the various language modes to make sure they are fully
correct.

   <p>Type <kbd>m s</kbd>, <kbd>m f</kbd>, and <kbd>d N</kbd> to reset these modes.  (You
may prefer to remain in Big mode, but all the examples in the tutorial
are shown in normal mode.)

   <p><a name="index-Area-under-a-curve-64"></a>What is the area under the portion of this curve from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x = 1</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo;? 
This is simply the integral of the function:

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  17 x^2 - 6 x^4 + 3     1:  5.6666 x^3 - 1.2 x^5 + 3 x
         .                          .
     
         r 1                        a i x
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">We want to evaluate this at our two values for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; and subtract. 
One way to do it is again with vector mapping and reduction:

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  [2, 1]            1:  [12.93333, 7.46666]    1:  5.46666
     1:  5.6666 x^3 ...        .                          .
     
        [ 2 , 1 ] &lt;TAB&gt;          V M $ &lt;RET&gt;                  V R -
</pre>
   <p>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 3.</strong>  Find the integral from 1 to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;
of
<!-- @math{x \sin \pi x} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x&nbsp;sin(pi&nbsp;x)</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
(where the sine is calculated in radians).  Find the values of the
integral for integers &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; from 1 to 5.  See <a href="Algebra-Answer-3.html#Algebra-Answer-3">3</a>. (&bull;)

   <p>Calc's integrator can do many simple integrals symbolically, but many
others are beyond its capabilities.  Suppose we wish to find the area
under the curve
<!-- @math{\sin x \ln x} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x) ln(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
over the same range of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you entered this formula and typed
<kbd>a i x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (don't bother to try this), Calc would work for a
long time but would be unable to find a solution.  In fact, there is no
closed-form solution to this integral.  Now what do we do?

   <p><a name="index-Integration_002c-numerical-65"></a><a name="index-Numerical-integration-66"></a>One approach would be to do the integral numerically.  It is not hard
to do this by hand using vector mapping and reduction.  It is rather
slow, though, since the sine and logarithm functions take a long time. 
We can save some time by reducing the working precision.

<pre class="smallexample">     3:  10                  1:  [1, 1.1, 1.2,  ...  , 1.8, 1.9]
     2:  1                       .
     1:  0.1

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Note that we have used the extended version of <kbd>v x</kbd>; we could
also have used plain <kbd>v x</kbd> as follows:  <kbd>v x 10 &lt;RET&gt; 9 + .1 *</kbd>.)

<pre class="smallexample">     2:  [1, 1.1, ... ]              1:  [0., 0.084941, 0.16993, ... ]
     1:  sin(x) ln(x)                    .
         .

   <p class="noindent">

         .          .
     
         V R +      0.1 *
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(If you got wildly different results, did you remember to switch
to Radians mode?)

   <p>Here we have divided the curve into ten segments of equal width;
approximating these segments as rectangular boxes (i.e., assuming
the curve is nearly flat at that resolution), we compute the areas
of the boxes (height times width), then sum the areas.  (It is
faster to sum first, then multiply by the width, since the width
is the same for every box.)

   <p>The true value of this integral turns out to be about 0.374, so
we're not doing too well.  Let's try another approach.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  sin(x) ln(x)    1:  0.84147 x - 0.84147 + 0.11957 (x - 1)^2 - ...
         .                   .
     
         r 1                 a t x=1 &lt;RET&gt; 4 &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here we have computed the Taylor series expansion of the function
about the point &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x=1</span></samp>&rsquo;.  We can now integrate this polynomial
approximation, since polynomials are easy to integrate.

<pre class="smallexample">     1:  0.42074 x^2 + ...    1:  [-0.0446, -0.42073]      1:  0.3761
         .                        .                            .
     
         a i x &lt;RET&gt;            [ 2 , 1 ] &lt;TAB&gt;  V M $ &lt;RET&gt;         V R -
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Better!  By increasing the precision and/or asking for more terms
in the Taylor series, we can get a result as accurate as we like. 
(Taylor series converge better away from singularities in the
function such as the one at <code>ln(0)</code>, so it would also help to
expand the series about the points &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x=2</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x=1.5</span></samp>&rsquo; instead
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x=1</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

   <p><a name="index-Simpson_0027s-rule-67"></a><a name="index-Integration-by-Simpson_0027s-rule-68"></a>(&bull;) <strong>Exercise 4.</strong>  Our first method approximated the
curve by stairsteps of width 0.1; the total area was then the sum
of the areas of the rectangles under these stairsteps.  Our second
method approximated the function by a polynomial, which turned out
to be a better approximation than stairsteps.  A third method is
<dfn>Simpson's rule</dfn>, which is like the stairstep method except
that the steps are not required to be flat.  Simpson's rule boils
down to the formula,

<pre class="example">     (h/3) * (f(a) + 4 f(a+h) + 2 f(a+2h) + 4 f(a+3h) + ...
                   + 2 f(a+(n-2)*h) + 4 f(a+(n-1)*h) + f(a+n*h))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; (which must be even) is the number of slices and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">h</span></samp>&rsquo;
is the width of each slice.  These are 10 and 0.1 in our example. 
For reference, here is the corresponding formula for the stairstep
method:

<pre class="example">     h * (f(a) + f(a+h) + f(a+2h) + f(a+3h) + ...
               + f(a+(n-2)*h) + f(a+(n-1)*h))
</pre>
   <p>Compute the integral from 1 to 2 of
<!-- @math{\sin x \ln x} -->
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sin(x) ln(x)</span></samp>&rsquo;
using Simpson's rule with 10 slices. 
See <a href="Algebra-Answer-4.html#Algebra-Answer-4">4</a>. (&bull;)

   <p>Calc has a built-in <kbd>a I</kbd> command for doing numerical integration. 
It uses <dfn>Romberg's method</dfn>, which is a more sophisticated cousin
of Simpson's rule.  In particular, it knows how to keep refining the
result until the current precision is satisfied.

<!-- [fix-ref Selecting Sub-Formulas] -->
   <p>Aside from the commands we've seen so far, Calc also provides a
large set of commands for operating on parts of formulas.  You
indicate the desired sub-formula by placing the cursor on any part
of the formula before giving a <dfn>selection</dfn> command.  Selections won't
be covered in the tutorial; see <a href="Selecting-Subformulas.html#Selecting-Subformulas">Selecting Subformulas</a>, for
details and examples.
