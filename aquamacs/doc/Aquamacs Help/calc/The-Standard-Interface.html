<h4 class="subsection">2.5.2 The Standard Calc Interface</h4>

<p class="noindent"><a name="index-Standard-user-interface-2"></a>Calc's standard interface acts like a traditional RPN calculator,
operated by the normal Emacs keyboard.  When you type <kbd>C-x * c</kbd>
to start the Calculator, the Emacs screen splits into two windows
with the file you were editing on top and Calc on the bottom.

     --%*-Calc: 12 Deg       (Calculator)----All----- --%*- *Calc Trail*
</pre>
   <p>In this figure, the mode-line for <samp><span class="file">myfile</span></samp> has moved up and the
&ldquo;Calculator&rdquo; window has appeared below it.  As you can see, Calc
actually makes two windows side-by-side.  The lefthand one is
called the <dfn>stack window</dfn> and the righthand one is called the
<dfn>trail window.</dfn>  The stack holds the numbers involved in the
calculation you are currently performing.  The trail holds a complete
record of all calculations you have done.  In a desk calculator with
a printer, the trail corresponds to the paper tape that records what
you do.

   <p>In this case, the trail shows that four numbers (17.3, 3, 2, and 4)
were first entered into the Calculator, then the 2 and 4 were
multiplied to get 8, then the 3 and 8 were subtracted to get <i>-5</i>. 
(The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol shows that this was the most recent calculation.) 
The net result is the two numbers 17.3 and <i>-5</i> sitting on the stack.

   <p>Most Calculator commands deal explicitly with the stack only, but
there is a set of commands that allow you to search back through
the trail and retrieve any previous result.

   <p>Calc commands use the digits, letters, and punctuation keys. 
Shifted (i.e., upper-case) letters are different from lowercase
letters.  Some letters are <dfn>prefix</dfn> keys that begin two-letter
commands.  For example, <kbd>e</kbd> means &ldquo;enter exponent&rdquo; and shifted
<kbd>E</kbd> means &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e^x</span></samp>&rsquo;.  With the <kbd>d</kbd> (&ldquo;display modes&rdquo;) prefix
the letter &ldquo;e&rdquo; takes on very different meanings:  <kbd>d e</kbd> means
&ldquo;engineering notation&rdquo; and <kbd>d E</kbd> means &ldquo;<dfn>eqn</dfn> language mode.&rdquo;

   <p>There is nothing stopping you from switching out of the Calc
window and back into your editing window, say by using the Emacs
<kbd>C-x&nbsp;o</kbd><!-- /@w --> (<code>other-window</code>) command.  When the cursor is
inside a regular window, Emacs acts just like normal.  When the
cursor is in the Calc stack or trail windows, keys are interpreted
as Calc commands.

   <p>When you quit by pressing <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> a second time, the Calculator
windows go away but the actual Stack and Trail are not gone, just
hidden.  When you press <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> once again you will get the
same stack and trail contents you had when you last used the
Calculator.

   <p>The Calculator does not remember its state between Emacs sessions. 
Thus if you quit Emacs and start it again, <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> will give you
a fresh stack and trail.  There is a command (<kbd>m m</kbd>) that lets
you save your favorite mode settings between sessions, though. 
One of the things it saves is which user interface (standard or
Keypad) you last used; otherwise, a freshly started Emacs will
always treat <kbd>C-x * *</kbd> the same as <kbd>C-x * c</kbd>.

   <p>The <kbd>q</kbd> key is another equivalent way to turn the Calculator off.

   <p>If you type <kbd>C-x * b</kbd> first and then <kbd>C-x * c</kbd>, you get a
full-screen version of Calc (<code>full-calc</code>) in which the stack and
trail windows are still side-by-side but are now as tall as the whole
Emacs screen.  When you press <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> again to quit,
the file you were editing before reappears.  The <kbd>C-x * b</kbd> key
switches back and forth between &ldquo;big&rdquo; full-screen mode and the
normal partial-screen mode.

   <p>Finally, <kbd>C-x * o</kbd> (<code>calc-other-window</code>) is like <kbd>C-x * c</kbd>
except that the Calc window is not selected.  The buffer you were
editing before remains selected instead.  If you are in a Calc window,
then <kbd>C-x * o</kbd> will switch you out of it, being careful not to
switch you to the Calc Trail window.  So <kbd>C-x * o</kbd> is a handy
way to switch out of Calc momentarily to edit your file; you can then
type <kbd>C-x * c</kbd> to switch back into Calc when you are done.
