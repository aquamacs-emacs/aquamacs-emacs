<h2 class="chapter">5 Index Support</h2>

<p><a name="index-Index-Support-231"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_005cindex_007d-232"></a>
LaTeX has builtin support for creating an Index.  The LaTeX core
supports two different indices, the standard index and a glossary.  With
the help of special LaTeX packages (<samp><span class="file">multind.sty</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">index.sty</span></samp>), any number of indices can be supported.

   <p>Index entries are created with the <code>\index{</code><var>entry</var><code>}</code> macro. 
All entries defined in a document are written out to the <samp><span class="file">.aux</span></samp>
file.  A separate tool must be used to convert this information into a
nicely formatted index.  Tools used with LaTeX include <code>MakeIndex</code>
and <code>xindy</code>.

   <p>Indexing is a very difficult task.  It must follow strict conventions to
make the index consistent and complete.  There are basically two
approaches one can follow, and both have their merits.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Part of the indexing should already be done with the markup.  The
document structure should be reflected in the index, so when starting
new sections, the basic topics of the section should be indexed.  If the
document contains definitions, theorems or the like, these should all
correspond to appropriate index entries.  This part of the index can
very well be developed along with the document.  Often it is worthwhile
to define special purpose macros which define an item and at the same
time make an index entry, possibly with special formatting to make the
reference page in the index bold or underlined.  To make <b>RefTeX</b>
support for indexing possible, these special macros must be added to
<b>RefTeX</b>'s configuration (see <a href="Defining-Index-Macros.html#Defining-Index-Macros">Defining Index Macros</a>).

     <li>The rest of the index is often just a collection of where in the
document certain words or phrases are being used.  This part is
difficult to develop along with the document, because consistent entries
for each occurrence are needed and are best selected when the document
is ready.  <b>RefTeX</b> supports this with an <em>index phrases file</em>
which collects phrases and helps indexing the phrases globally.
        </ol>

   <p>Before you start, you need to make sure that <b>RefTeX</b> knows about
the index style being used in the current document.  <b>RefTeX</b> has
builtin support for the default <code>\index</code> and <code>\glossary</code>
macros.  Other LaTeX packages, like the <samp><span class="file">multind</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">index</span></samp>
package, redefine the <code>\index</code> macro to have an additional
argument, and <b>RefTeX</b> needs to be configured for those.  A
sufficiently new version of AUCTeX (9.10c or later) will do this
automatically.  If you really don't use AUCTeX (you should!), this
configuration needs to be done by hand with the menu (<code>Ref-&gt;Index
Style</code>), or globally for all your documents with

<pre class="lisp">     (setq reftex-index-macros '(multind))     <span class="roman">or</span>
     (setq reftex-index-macros '(index))
</pre>
   <ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="Creating-Index-Entries.html#Creating-Index-Entries">Creating Index Entries</a>:            Macros and completion of entries. 
<li><a accesskey="2" href="The-Index-Phrases-File.html#The-Index-Phrases-File">The Index Phrases File</a>:            A special file for global indexing.
