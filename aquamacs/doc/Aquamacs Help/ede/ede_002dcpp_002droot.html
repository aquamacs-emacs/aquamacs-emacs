<h4 class="subsection">6.1.1 ede-cpp-root</h4>

<p>The <code>ede-cpp-root</code> project type allows you to create a single
object with no save-file in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  It allows <i>EDE</i>
to provide the <i>Semantic</i> package with the ability to find header
files quickly.

   <p>The <code>ede-cpp-root</code> class knows a few things about C++ projects,
such as the prevalence of "include" directories, and typical
file-layout stuff.  If this isn't sufficient, you can subclass
<code>ede-cpp-root-project</code> and add your own tweaks in just a few
lines.  See the end of this file for an example.

   <p>In the most basic case, add this to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, modifying
appropriate bits as needed.

<pre class="example">     (ede-cpp-root-project "SOMENAME" :file "/dir/to/some/file")
</pre>
   <p>Replace <var>SOMENAME</var> with whatever name you want, and the filename
to an actual file at the root of your project.  It might be a
Makefile, a README file.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  It's just a
key to hang the rest of <i>EDE</i> off of.

   <p>The most likely reason to create this project, is to speed up
searching for includes files, or to simplify bootstrapping <i>Semantic</i>'s
ability to find files without much user interaction.  In conjunction
with <i>Semantic</i> completion, having a short include path is key.  You can
override the default include path and system include path like this:

<pre class="example">     (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME"
         :include-path '( "/include" "../include" "/c/include" )
         :system-include-path '( "/usr/include/c++/3.2.2/" )
         :spp-table '( ("MOOSE" . "")
                       ("CONST" . "const") ) )
</pre>
   <p>In this case each item in the include path list is searched.  If the
directory starts with "/", then that expands to the project root
directory.  If a directory does not start with "/", then it is
relative to the default-directory of the current buffer when the file
name is expanded.

   <p>The include path only affects C/C++ header files.  Use the slot
<code>:header-match-regexp</code> to change it.

   <p>The <code>:system-include-path</code> allows you to specify full directory
names to include directories where system header files can be found. 
These will be applied to files in this project only.

   <p>The <code>:spp-table</code> provides a list of project specific #define
style macros that are unique to this project, passed in to the
compiler on the command line, or are in special headers. 
See the <code>semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map</code> for more
on how to format this entry.

   <p>If there is a single file in your project, you can instead set the
<code>:spp-files</code> to a list of file names relative to the root of your
project.  Specifying this is like setting the variable
<code>semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file</code> in semantic.

   <p>If you want to override the file-finding tool with your own
function you can do this:

<pre class="example">     (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME" :locate-fcn 'MYFCN)
</pre>
   <p>Where <var>MYFCN</var> is a symbol for a function.  The locate function can
be used in place of <code>ede-expand-filename</code> so you can quickly
customize your custom target to use specialized local routines instead
of the default <i>EDE</i> routines.  The function symbol must take two
arguments:

     <dl>
<dt><var>NAME</var><dd>The name of the file to find. 
<br><dt><var>DIR</var><dd>The directory root for this cpp-root project. 
</dl>

   <p>If the cpp-root project style is right for you, but you want a dynamic
loader, instead of hard-coding path name values in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>, you
can do that too, but you will need to write some lisp code.

   <p>To do that, you need to add an entry to the
<code>ede-project-class-files</code> list, and also provide two functions to
teach <i>EDE</i> how to load your project pattern

   <p>It would look like this:

<pre class="example">     (defun MY-FILE-FOR-DIR (&amp;optional dir)
       "Return a full file name to the project file stored in DIR."
       &lt;write your code here, or return nil&gt;
       )
     
     (defun MY-ROOT-FCN ()
       "Return the root fcn for `default-directory'"
       ;; You might be able to use `ede-cpp-root-project-root'
       ;; and not write this at all.
       )
     
     (defun MY-LOAD (dir)
       "Load a project of type `cpp-root' for the directory DIR.
     Return nil if there isn't one."
       ;; Use your preferred constructin method here.
       (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file (expand-file-name "FILE" dir)
                                    :locate-fcn 'MYFCN)
       )
     
     (add-to-list 'ede-project-class-files
                  (ede-project-autoload "cpp-root"
                   :name "CPP ROOT"
                   :file 'ede-cpp-root
                   :proj-file 'MY-FILE-FOR-DIR
                   :proj-root 'MY-ROOT-FCN
                   :load-type 'MY-LOAD
                   :class-sym 'ede-cpp-root)
                  t)
</pre>
   <p>This example only creates an auto-loader, and does not create a new kind
of project.

   <p>See <a href="ede_002dcpp_002droot_002dproject.html#ede_002dcpp_002droot_002dproject">ede-cpp-root-project</a>, for details about the class that defines
the <code>ede-cpp-root</code> project type.
