<h3 class="section">1.5 Multiple Files in Viper</h3>

<p><a name="index-multiple-files-57"></a><a name="index-managing-multiple-files-58"></a>
Viper can edit multiple files.  This means, for example that you never need
to suffer through <code>No write since last change</code> errors. 
Some Viper elements are common over all the files.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Textmarkers</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-markers-59"></a><a name="index-textmarkers-60"></a>Textmarkers remember <em>files and positions</em>. 
If you set marker &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; in
file <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp>, start editing file <samp><span class="file">bar</span></samp> and type <kbd>'a</kbd>, then
<em>YOU WILL SWITCH TO FILE </em><samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp>.  You can see the contents of a
textmarker using the Viper command <kbd>[&lt;a-z&gt;</kbd> where &lt;a-z&gt; are the
textmarkers, e.g., <kbd>[a</kbd> to view marker &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; . 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Repeated Commands</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Command repetitions are common over files.  Typing <kbd>!!</kbd> will repeat the
last <kbd>!</kbd> command whichever file it was issued from. 
Typing <kbd>.</kbd> will repeat the last command from any file, and
searches will repeat the last search.  Ex commands can be repeated by typing
<kbd>: &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
Note: in some rare cases, that <kbd>: &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> may do something dangerous. 
However, usually its effect can be undone by typing <kbd>u</kbd>. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Registers</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-registers-61"></a>Registers are common to files.  Also, text yanked with <kbd>y</kbd> can be
put back (<kbd>p</kbd>) into any file.  The Viper command <kbd>]&lt;a-z&gt;</kbd>, where &lt;a-z&gt; are
the registers, can be used to look at the contents of a register, e.g.,
type <kbd>]a</kbd> to view register &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>There is one difference in text deletion that you should be
aware of.  This difference comes from Emacs and was adopted in Viper
because we find it very useful.  In Vi, if you delete a line, say, and then
another line, these two deletions are separated and are put back
separately if you use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; command.  In Emacs (and Viper), successive
series of deletions that are <em>not interrupted</em> by other commands are
lumped together, so the deleted text gets accumulated and can be put back
as one chunk.  If you want to break a sequence of deletions so that the
newly deleted text could be put back separately from the previously deleted
text, you should perform a non-deleting action, e.g., move the cursor one
character in any direction. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Absolute Filenames</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-absolute-file-names-62"></a>The current directory name for a file is automatically prepended to the
file name in any
<kbd>:e</kbd>, <kbd>:r</kbd>, <kbd>:w</kbd>, etc., command (in Emacs, each buffer has a
current directory). 
This directory is inserted in the minibuffer once you type space after
<kbd>:e, r</kbd>, etc.  Viper also supports completion of file names and Ex
commands (&lt;TAB&gt;), and it keeps track of
command and file history (<kbd>M-p</kbd>, <kbd>M-n</kbd>). 
Absolute filenames are required less
often in Viper.

     <p>You should be aware that Emacs interprets <kbd>/foo/bar//bla</kbd> as
<kbd>/bla</kbd> and <kbd>/foo/~/bar</kbd> as <kbd>~/bar</kbd>.  This is designed to
minimize the need for erasing file names that Emacs suggests in its
prompts, if a suggested file name is not what you wanted.

     <p>The command <kbd>:cd</kbd> will change the default directory for the
current Emacs buffer.  The Ex command <kbd>:e</kbd> will interpret the
filename argument in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">csh</span></samp>&rsquo;, by default.  See <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>, if you
want to change this. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">Currently undisplayed files can be listed using the <kbd>:ar</kbd> command.  The
command <kbd>:n</kbd> can be given counts from the <kbd>:ar</kbd> list to switch to
other files. For example, use `:n3' to move to the third file in that list.
