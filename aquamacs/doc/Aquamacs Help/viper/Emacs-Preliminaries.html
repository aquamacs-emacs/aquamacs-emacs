<p><a name="index-buffer-1"></a><a name="index-point-2"></a><a name="index-mark-3"></a><a name="index-text-4"></a><a name="index-looking-at-5"></a><a name="index-end-_0028of-buffer_0029-6"></a><a name="index-end-_0028of-line_0029-7"></a><a name="index-region-8"></a>
Emacs can edit several files at once.  A file in Emacs is placed in a
<dfn>buffer</dfn> that usually has the same name as the file.  Buffers are also used
for other purposes, such as shell interfaces, directory editing, etc. 
See <a href="../emacs/Dired.html#Dired">Directory Editor</a>, for an example.

   <p>A buffer has a distinguished position called the <dfn>point</dfn>. 
A <dfn>point</dfn> is always between 2 characters, and is <dfn>looking at</dfn>
the right hand character.  The cursor is positioned on the right hand
character.  Thus, when the <dfn>point</dfn> is looking at the end-of-line,
the cursor is on the end-of-line character, i.e. beyond the last
character on the line.  This is the default Emacs behavior.

   <p>The default settings of Viper try to mimic the behavior of Vi, preventing
the cursor from going beyond the last character on the line.  By using
Emacs commands directly (such as those bound to arrow keys), it is possible
to get the cursor beyond the end-of-line.  However, this won't (or
shouldn't) happen if you restrict yourself to standard Vi keys, unless you
modify the default editing style.  See <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>.

   <p>In addition to the <dfn>point</dfn>, there is another distinguished buffer
position called the <dfn>mark</dfn>.  See <a href="../emacs/Mark.html#Mark">Mark</a>, for more info on the mark.  The text between the <dfn>point</dfn> and
the <dfn>mark</dfn> is called the <dfn>region</dfn> of the buffer.  For the Viper
user, this simply means that in addition to the Vi textmarkers a&ndash;z, there
is another marker called <dfn>mark</dfn>.  This is similar to the unnamed Vi
marker used by the jump commands <kbd>``</kbd> and <kbd>''</kbd>, which move the
cursor to the position of the last absolute jump.  Viper provides access to
the region in most text manipulation commands as <kbd>r</kbd> and <kbd>R</kbd> suffix
to commands that operate on text regions, e.g., <kbd>dr</kbd> to delete region,
etc.

   <p>Furthermore, Viper lets Ex-style commands to work on the current region. 
This is done by typing a digit argument before <kbd>:</kbd>.  For instance,
typing <kbd>1:</kbd> will prompt you with something like <em>:123,135</em>,
assuming that the current region starts at line 123 and ends at line
135.  There is no need to type the line numbers, since Viper inserts them
automatically in front of the Ex command.

   <p>See <a href="Basics.html#Basics">Basics</a>, for more info.

Emacs divides the screen into tiled <dfn>windows</dfn>.  You can see the
contents of a buffer through the window associated with the buffer.  The
cursor of the screen is positioned on the character after <dfn>point</dfn>. 
Every window has a <dfn>mode line</dfn> that displays information about the buffer. 
You can change the format of the mode
line, but normally if you see &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">**</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of a mode line it
means that the buffer is <dfn>modified</dfn>.  If you write out the contents of
a buffer to a file, then the buffer will become not modified.  Also if
you see &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of the mode line, it means that the file
associated with the buffer is write protected.  The mode line will also
show the buffer name and current major and minor modes (see below). 
A special buffer called <dfn>Minibuffer</dfn> is displayed as the last line
in a minibuffer window.  The minibuffer window is used for command input
output.  Viper uses minibuffer window for <kbd>/</kbd> and <kbd>:</kbd>
commands.

An Emacs buffer can have a <dfn>major mode</dfn> that customizes Emacs for
editing text of a particular sort by changing the functionality of the keys. 
Keys are defined using a <dfn>keymap</dfn> that records the bindings between
keystrokes and
functions.  The <dfn>global keymap</dfn> is common to all the
buffers.  Additionally, each buffer has its <dfn>local keymap</dfn> that determines the
<dfn>mode</dfn> of the buffer.  If a function is bound to some key in the local
keymap then that function will be executed when you type the key. 
If no function is bound to a key in the
local map, however, the function bound to the key in the global map
will be executed.  See <a href="../emacs/Major-Modes.html#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>, for more information.

   <p>A buffer can also have a <dfn>minor mode</dfn>.  Minor modes are options that
you can use or not.  A buffer in <code>text-mode</code> can have
<code>auto-fill-mode</code> as minor mode, which can be turned off or on at
any time.  In Emacs, a minor mode may have it own keymap,
which overrides the local keymap when the minor mode is turned on.  For
more information, see <a href="../emacs/Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>

   <p><a name="index-Viper-as-minor-mode-21"></a><a name="index-Control-keys-22"></a><a name="index-Meta-key-23"></a>
Viper is implemented as a collection of minor modes.  Different minor modes
are involved when Viper emulates Vi command mode, Vi insert mode, etc. 
You can also turn Viper on and off at any time while in Vi command mode. 
See <a href="States-in-Viper.html#States-in-Viper">States in Viper</a>, for
more information.

   <p>Emacs uses Control and Meta modifiers.  These are denoted as C and M,
e.g. <kbd>^Z</kbd> as <kbd>C-z</kbd> and <kbd>Meta-x</kbd> as <kbd>M-x</kbd>.  The Meta key is
usually located on each side of the Space bar; it is used in a manner
similar to the Control key, e.g., <kbd>M-x</kbd> means typing <kbd>x</kbd> while
holding the Meta key down.  For keyboards that do not have a Meta key,
&lt;ESC&gt; is used as Meta.  Thus <kbd>M-x</kbd> is typed as <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;
x</kbd>.  Viper uses &lt;ESC&gt; to switch from Insert state to Vi state.  Therefore
Viper defines <kbd>C-\</kbd> as its Meta key in Vi state.  See <a href="Vi-State.html#Vi-State">Vi State</a>, for
more info.

   <p>Emacs is structured as a Lisp interpreter around a C core.  Emacs keys
cause Lisp functions to be called.  It is possible to call these
functions directly, by typing <kbd>M-x function-name</kbd>.
