<h3 class="section">3.1 Rudimentary Changes</h3>

<p><a name="index-setting-variables-174"></a><a name="index-variables-for-customization-175"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040kbd_007b_003aset_007d-176"></a>
An easy way to customize Viper is to change the values of constants used in
Viper.  Here is the list of the constants used in Viper and their default
values.  The corresponding :se command is also indicated.  (The symbols
<code>t</code> and <code>nil</code> represent &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;false&rdquo; in Lisp).

   <p>Viper supports both the abbreviated Vi variable names and their full
names.  Variable completion is done on full names only.  &lt;TAB&gt; and
&lt;SPC&gt; complete
variable names.  Typing `=' will complete the name and then will prompt for
a value, if applicable.  For instance, <kbd>:se au &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> will complete the
command to <kbd>:set autoindent</kbd>; <kbd>:se ta &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> will complete the command
and prompt further like this: <kbd>:set tabstop = </kbd>. 
However, typing <kbd>:se ts &lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> will produce a &ldquo;No match&rdquo; message
because <kbd>ts</kbd> is an abbreviation for <kbd>tabstop</kbd> and Viper supports
completion on full names only.  However, you can still hit &lt;RET&gt;
or <kbd>=</kbd>, which will complete the command like this: <kbd>:set ts = </kbd> and
Viper will be waiting for you to type a value for the tabstop variable. 
To get the full list of Vi variables, type <kbd>:se &lt;SPC&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>viper-auto-indent nil</code><dt><code>:se ai (:se autoindent)</code><dt><code>:se ai-g (:se autoindent-global)</code><dd>If <code>t</code>, enable auto indentation. 
by &lt;RET&gt;, <kbd>o</kbd> or <kbd>O</kbd> command.

     <p><code>viper-auto-indent</code> is a local variable.  To change the value globally, use
<code>setq-default</code>.  It may be useful for certain major modes to have their
own values of <code>viper-auto-indent</code>.  This can be achieved by using
<code>setq</code> to change the local value of this variable in the hooks to the
appropriate major modes.

     <p><kbd>:se ai</kbd> changes the value of <code>viper-auto-indent</code> in the current
buffer only; <kbd>:se ai-g</kbd> does the same globally. 
<br><dt><code>viper-electric-mode t</code><dd>If not <code>nil</code>, auto-indentation becomes electric, which means that
&lt;RET&gt;, <kbd>O</kbd>, and <kbd>o</kbd> indent cursor according to the current
major mode.  In the future, this variable may control additional electric
features.

     <p>This is a local variable: <code>setq</code> changes the value of this variable
in the current buffer only.  Use <code>setq-default</code> to change the value in
all buffers. 
<br><dt><code>viper-case-fold-search nil</code><dt><code>:se ic (:se ignorecase)</code><dd>If not <code>nil</code>, search ignores cases. 
This can also be toggled by quickly hitting <kbd>/</kbd> twice. 
<br><dt><code>viper-re-search nil</code><dt><code>:se magic</code><dd>If not <code>nil</code>, search will use regular expressions; if <code>nil</code> then
use vanilla search. 
This behavior can also be toggled by quickly hitting <kbd>/</kbd> trice. 
<br><dt><code>buffer-read-only</code><dt><code>:se ro (:se readonly)</code><dd>Set current buffer to read only.  To change globally put
<code>(setq-default buffer-read-only t)</code> in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file. 
<br><dt><code>blink-matching-paren t</code><dt><code>:se sm (:se showmatch)</code><dd>Show matching parens by blinking cursor. 
<br><dt><code>tab-width t (default setting via setq-default)</code><dt><code>:se ts=value (:se tabstop=value)</code><dt><code>:se ts-g=value (:se tabstop-global=value)</code><dd><code>tab-width</code> is a local variable that controls the width of the tab stops. 
To change the value globally, use <code>setq-default</code>; for local settings,
use <code>setq</code>.

     <p>The command <kbd>:se ts</kbd>
sets the tab width in the current
buffer only; it has no effect on other buffers.

     <p>The command <kbd>:se ts-g</kbd> sets tab width globally,
for all buffers where the tab is not yet set locally,
including the new buffers.

     <p>Note that typing &lt;TAB&gt; normally
doesn't insert the tab, since this key is usually bound to
a text-formatting function, <code>indent-for-tab-command</code> (which facilitates
programming and document writing).  Instead, the tab is inserted via the
command <code>viper-insert-tab</code>, which is bound to <kbd>S-tab</kbd> (shift + tab).

     <p>On some non-windowing terminals, Shift doesn't modify the &lt;TAB&gt; key, so
<kbd>S-tab</kbd> behaves as if it were &lt;TAB&gt;.  In such a case, you will have
to bind <code>viper-insert-tab</code> to some other convenient key.

     <br><dt><code>viper-shift-width 8</code><dt><code>:se sw=value  (:se shiftwidth=value)</code><dd>The number of columns shifted by <kbd>&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>&lt;</kbd> commands. 
<br><dt><code>viper-search-wrap-around t</code><dt><code>:se ws (:se wrapscan)</code><dd>If not <code>nil</code>, search wraps around the end/beginning of buffer. 
<br><dt><code>viper-search-scroll-threshold 2</code><dd>If search lands within this many lines of the window top or bottom, the
window will be scrolled up or down by about 1/7-th of its size, to reveal
the context.  If the value is negative&mdash;don't scroll. 
<br><dt><code>viper-tags-file-name "TAGS"</code><dd>The name of the file used as the tag table. 
<br><dt><code>viper-re-query-replace nil</code><dd>If not <code>nil</code>, use reg-exp replace in query replace. 
<br><dt><code>viper-want-ctl-h-help nil</code><dd>If not <code>nil</code>, <kbd>C-h</kbd> is bound to <code>help-command</code>;
otherwise, <kbd>C-h</kbd> is bound as usual in Vi. 
<br><dt><code>viper-vi-style-in-minibuffer t</code><dd>If not <code>nil</code>, Viper provides a high degree of compatibility with Vi
insert mode when you type text in the minibuffer; if <code>nil</code>, typing in
the minibuffer feels like plain Emacs. 
<br><dt><code>viper-no-multiple-ESC t</code><dd>If you set this to <code>nil</code>, you can use &lt;ESC&gt; as Meta in Vi state. 
Normally, this is not necessary, since graphical displays have separate
Meta keys (usually on each side of the space bar).  On a dumb terminal, Viper
sets this variable to <code>twice</code>, which is almost like <code>nil</code>, except
that double &lt;ESC&gt; beeps.  This, too, lets &lt;ESC&gt; to be used as a Meta. 
<br><dt><code>viper-fast-keyseq-timeout 200</code><dd>Key sequences separated by this many milliseconds are treated as Vi-style
keyboard macros.  If the key sequence is defined as such a macro, it will be
executed.  Otherwise, it is processed as an ordinary sequence of typed keys.

     <p>Setting this variable too high may slow down your typing.  Setting it too
low may make it hard to type macros quickly enough. 
<br><dt><code>viper-ex-style-motion t</code><dd>Set this to <code>nil</code>, if you want <kbd>l,h</kbd> to cross
lines, etc.  See <a href="Movement-and-Markers.html#Movement-and-Markers">Movement and Markers</a>, for more info. 
<br><dt><code>viper-ex-style-editing t</code><dd>Set this to <code>nil</code>, if you want
<kbd>C-h</kbd> and &lt;DEL&gt; to not stop
at the beginning of a line in Insert state, &lt;X&gt; and &lt;x&gt; to delete
characters across lines in Vi command state, etc. 
<br><dt><code>viper-ESC-moves-cursor-back t</code><dd>It <code>t</code>, cursor moves back 1 character when switching from insert state to vi
state.  If <code>nil</code>, the cursor stays where it was before the switch. 
<br><dt><code>viper-always t</code><dd><code>t</code> means: leave it to Viper to decide when a buffer must be brought
up in Vi state,
Insert state, or Emacs state.  This heuristics works well in virtually all
cases.  <code>nil</code> means you either has to invoke <code>viper-mode</code> manually
for each buffer (or you can add <code>viper-mode</code> to the appropriate major mode
hooks using <code>viper-load-hook</code>).

     <p>This option must be set in the file <samp><span class="file">~/.viper</span></samp>. 
<br><dt><code>viper-custom-file-name "~/.viper"</code><dd>File used for Viper-specific customization. 
Change this setting, if you want.  Must be set in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> (not <samp><span class="file">.viper</span></samp>!) 
before Viper is loaded.  Note that you
have to set it as a string inside double quotes. 
<br><dt><code>viper-spell-function 'ispell-region</code><dd>Function used by the command <kbd>#c&lt;move&gt;</kbd> to spell. 
<br><dt><code>viper-glob-function</code><dd>The value of this variable is the function symbol used to expand wildcard
symbols. This is platform-dependent. The default tries to set this variable
to work with most shells, MS Windows, OS/2, etc. However, if it
doesn't work the way you expect, you should write your own. 
Use <code>viper-glob-unix-files</code> and <code>viper-glob-mswindows-files</code> in
<samp><span class="file">viper-util.el</span></samp> as examples.

     <p>This feature is used to expand wildcards in the Ex command <kbd>:e</kbd>. 
Note that Viper doesn't support wildcards in the <kbd>:r</kbd> and <kbd>:w</kbd>
commands, because file completion is a better mechanism. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dglob_002dfunction_007d-177"></a>
<br><dt><code>ex-cycle-other-window t</code><dd>If not <code>nil</code>, <kbd>:n</kbd> and <kbd>:b</kbd> will cycle through files in another
window, if one exists. 
<br><dt><code>ex-cycle-through-non-files nil</code><dd><kbd>:n</kbd> does not normally cycle through buffers.  Set this to get
buffers also. 
<br><dt><code>viper-want-emacs-keys-in-insert</code><dd>This is set to <code>nil</code> for user levels 1 and 2 and to <code>t</code> for user
levels 3 and 4.  Users who specify level 5 are allowed to set this variable
as they please (the default for this level is <code>t</code>).  If set to
<code>nil</code>, complete Vi compatibility is provided in Insert state.  This is
really not recommended, as this precludes you from using language-specific
features provided by the major modes. 
<br><dt><code>viper-want-emacs-keys-in-vi</code><dd>This is set to <code>nil</code> for user
level 1 and to <code>t</code> for user levels 2&ndash;4. 
At level 5, users are allowed to set this variable as they please (the
default for this level is <code>t</code>). 
If set to <code>nil</code>, complete Vi compatibility is provided
in Vi command state.  Setting this to <code>nil</code> is really a bad idea,
unless you are a novice, as this precludes the use
of language-specific features provided by the major modes. 
<br><dt><code>viper-keep-point-on-repeat t</code><dd>If not <code>nil</code>, point is not moved when the user repeats the previous
command by typing `.'  This is very useful for doing repeated changes with
the <kbd>.</kbd> key. 
<br><dt><code>viper-repeat-from-history-key 'f12</code><dd>Prefix key used to invoke the macros <kbd>f12 1</kbd> and <kbd>f12 2</kbd> that repeat
the second-last and the third-last destructive command. 
Both these macros are bound (as Viper macros) to
<code>viper-repeat-from-history</code>,
which checks the second key by which it is invoked to see which of the
previous commands to invoke.  Viper binds <kbd>f12 1</kbd> and <kbd>f12 2</kbd> only,
but the user can bind more in <samp><span class="file">~/.viper</span></samp>.  See <a href="Vi-Macros.html#Vi-Macros">Vi Macros</a>, for how to do
this. 
<br><dt><code>viper-keep-point-on-undo nil</code><dd>If not <code>nil</code>, Viper tries to not move point when undoing commands. 
Instead, it will briefly move the cursor to the place where change has
taken place.  However, if the undone piece of text is not seen in window,
then point will be moved to the place where the change took place. 
Set it to <code>t</code> and see if you like it better. 
<br><dt><code>viper-delete-backwards-in-replace nil</code><dd>If not <code>nil</code>, &lt;DEL&gt; key will delete characters while moving the cursor
backwards.  If <code>nil</code>, the cursor will move backwards without deleting
anything. 
<br><dt><code>viper-replace-overlay-face 'viper-replace-overlay-face</code><dd>On a graphical display, Viper highlights replacement regions instead of
putting a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; at the end.  This variable controls the so called
<dfn>face</dfn> used to highlight the region.

     <p>By default, <code>viper-replace-overlay-face</code> underlines the replacement on
monochrome displays and also lays a stipple over them.  On color displays,
replacement regions are highlighted with color.

     <p>If you know something about Emacs faces and don't like how Viper highlights
replacement regions, you can change <code>viper-replace-overlay-face</code> by
specifying a new face.  (Emacs faces are described in the Emacs Lisp
reference.)  On a color display, the following customization method is
usually most effective:
     <pre class="example">          (set-face-foreground viper-replace-overlay-face "DarkSlateBlue")
          (set-face-background viper-replace-overlay-face "yellow")
</pre>
     <p>For a complete list of colors available to you, evaluate the expression
<code>(x-defined-colors)</code>.  (Type it in the buffer <code>*scratch*</code> and then
hit the <kbd>C-j</kbd> key.

     <br><dt><code>viper-replace-overlay-cursor-color  "Red"</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dreplace_002doverlay_002dcursor_002dcolor_007d-178"></a>Cursor color when it is inside the replacement region. 
This has effect only on color displays and only when Emacs runs as an X
application. 
<br><dt><code>viper-insert-state-cursor-color nil</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dinsert_002dstate_002dcursor_002dcolor_007d-179"></a>If set to a valid color, this will be the cursor color when Viper is in
insert state. 
<br><dt><code>viper-emacs-state-cursor-color nil</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002demacs_002dstate_002dcursor_002dcolor_007d-180"></a>If set to a valid color, this will be the cursor color when Viper is in
emacs state. 
<br><dt><code>viper-replace-region-end-delimiter "$"</code><dd>A string used to mark the end of replacement regions.  It is used only on
TTYs or if <code>viper-use-replace-region-delimiters</code> is non-<code>nil</code>. 
<br><dt><code>viper-replace-region-start-delimiter  ""</code><dd>A string used to mark the beginning of replacement regions.  It is used
only on TTYs or if <code>viper-use-replace-region-delimiters</code> is non-<code>nil</code>. 
<br><dt><code>viper-use-replace-region-delimiters</code><dd>If non-<code>nil</code>, Viper will always use <code>viper-replace-region-end-delimiter</code> and
<code>viper-replace-region-start-delimiter</code> to delimit replacement regions,
even on color displays (where this is unnecessary).  By default, this
variable is non-<code>nil</code> only on TTYs or monochrome displays. 
<br><dt><code>viper-allow-multiline-replace-regions t</code><dd>If non-<code>nil</code>, multi-line text replacement regions, such as those produced by
commands <kbd>c55w</kbd>, <kbd>3C</kbd>, etc., will stay around until the user exits
the replacement mode.  In this variable is set to <code>nil</code>, Viper will
emulate the standard Vi behavior, which supports only intra-line
replacement regions (and multi-line replacement regions are deleted). 
<br><dt><code>viper-toggle-key "\C-z"</code><dd>Specifies the key used to switch from Emacs to Vi and back. 
Must be set in <samp><span class="file">.viper</span></samp>.  This variable can't be
changed interactively after Viper is loaded.

     <p>In Insert state, this key acts as a temporary escape to Vi state, i.e., it
will set Viper up so that the very next command will be executed as if it
were typed in Vi state. 
<br><dt><code>viper-buffer-search-char nil</code><dd>Key used for buffer search.  See <a href="Viper-Specials.html#Viper-Specials">Viper Specials</a>, for details. 
<br><dt><code>viper-surrounding-word-function 'viper-surrounding-word</code><dd>The value of this variable is a function name that is used to determine
what constitutes a word clicked upon by the mouse.  This is used by mouse
search and insert. 
<br><dt><code>viper-search-face 'viper-search-face</code><dd>Variable that controls how search patterns are highlighted when they are
found. 
<br><dt><code>viper-vi-state-hook nil</code><dd>List of parameterless functions to be run just after entering the Vi
command state. 
<br><dt><code>viper-insert-state-hook nil</code><dd>Same for Insert state.  This hook is also run after entering Replace state. 
<br><dt><code>viper-replace-state-hook  nil</code><dd>List of (parameterless) functions called just after entering Replace state
(and after all <code>viper-insert-state-hook</code>). 
<br><dt><code>viper-emacs-state-hook nil</code><dd>List of (parameterless) functions called just after switching from Vi state
to Emacs state. 
<br><dt><code>viper-load-hook nil</code><dd>List of (parameterless) functions called just after loading Viper.  This is
the last chance to do customization before Viper is up and running. 
</dl>
   You can reset some of these constants in Viper with the Ex command <kbd>:set</kbd>
(when so indicated in the table).  Or you
can include a line like this in your <samp><span class="file">.viper</span></samp> file:
