<h4 class="subsection">1.3.1 Emacs State</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040kbd_007bC_002dz_007d-35"></a><a name="index-Emacs-state-36"></a>

   <p>You will be in this mode only by accident (hopefully).  This is the state
Emacs is normally in (imagine!!).  Now leave it as soon as possible by
typing <kbd>C-z</kbd>.  Then you will be in Vi state (sigh of relief) :-).

   <p>Emacs state is actually a Viperism to denote all the major and minor modes
(see <a href="Emacs-Preliminaries.html#Emacs-Preliminaries">Emacs Preliminaries</a>) other than Viper that Emacs can be in.  Emacs
can have several modes, such as C mode for editing C programs, LaTeX mode
for editing LaTeX documents, Dired for directory editing, etc.  These are
major modes, each with a different set of key-bindings.  Viper states are
orthogonal to these Emacs major modes.  The presence of these language
sensitive and other modes is a major win over Vi.  See <a href="Improvements-over-Vi.html#Improvements-over-Vi">Improvements over Vi</a>, for more.

   <p>The bindings for these modes can be made available in the Viper Insert state
as well as in Emacs state.  Unless you specify your user level as 1 (a
novice), all major mode key sequences that start with <kbd>C-x</kbd> and
<kbd>C-c</kbd> are also available in Vi state.  This is important because major
modes designed for editing files, such as cc-mode or latex-mode, use key
sequences that begin with <kbd>C-x</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd>.

   <p>There is also a key that lets you temporarily escape to Vi command state
from the Insert state: typing <kbd>C-z</kbd> will let you execute a
single Vi command while staying in Viper's Insert state.
