<h3 class="section">2.8 Movement and Markers</h3>

<p><a name="index-Ex-style-motion-95"></a><a name="index-line-editor-motion-96"></a>
Viper can be set free from the line&ndash;limited movements in Vi, such as <kbd>l</kbd>
refusing to move beyond the line, &lt;ESC&gt; moving one character back,
etc.  These derive from Ex, which is a line editor.  If your <samp><span class="file">.viper</span></samp>
contains

<pre class="example">     <code>(setq viper-ex-style-motion nil)</code>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the motion will be a true screen editor motion.  One thing you must then
watch out for is that it is possible to be on the end-of-line character. 
The keys <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>%</kbd> will still work correctly, i.e., as if they
were on the last character.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dsyntax_002dpreference_007d-97"></a><a name="index-syntax-table-98"></a>
The word-movement commands <kbd>w</kbd>, <kbd>e</kbd>, etc., and the associated
deletion/yanking commands, <kbd>dw</kbd>, <kbd>yw</kbd>, etc., can be made to
understand Emacs syntax tables.  If the variable
<code>viper-syntax-preference</code> is set to <code>strict-vi</code> then
the meaning of <em>word</em> is the same as in
Vi.  However, if the value is <code>reformed-vi</code> (the default) then the
alphanumeric symbols will be those specified by the current Emacs syntax
table (which may be different for different major modes) plus the
underscore symbol <kbd>_</kbd>, minus some non-word symbols, like '.;,|, etc. 
Both <code>strict-vi</code> and <code>reformed-vi</code> work close to Vi in
traditional cases, but <code>reformed-vi</code> does a better job when editing
text in non-Latin alphabets.

   <p>The user can also specify the value <code>emacs</code>, which would
make Viper use exactly the Emacs notion of word.  In particular, the
underscore may not be part of a word.  Finally, if
<code>viper-syntax-preference</code> is set to <code>extended</code>, Viper words would
consist of characters that are classified as alphanumeric <em>or</em> as
parts of symbols.  This is convenient for writing programs and in many other
situations.

   <p><code>viper-syntax-preference</code> is a local variable, so it can have different
values for different major modes.  For instance, in programming modes it can
have the value <code>extended</code>.  In text modes where words contain special
characters, such as European (non-English) letters, Cyrillic letters, etc.,
the value can be <code>reformed-vi</code> or <code>emacs</code>.

   <p>Changes to <code>viper-syntax-preference</code> should be done in the hooks to
various major modes by executing <code>viper-set-syntax-preference</code> as in
the following example:

<pre class="example">     (viper-set-syntax-preference nil "emacs")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bviper_002dset_002dsyntax_002dpreference_007d-99"></a>
The above discussion of the meaning of Viper's words concerns only Viper's
movement commands.  In regular expressions, words remain the same as in
Emacs.  That is, the expressions <code>\w</code>, <code>\&gt;</code>, <code>\&lt;</code>, etc., use
Emacs' idea of what is a word, and they don't look into the value of
variable <code>viper-syntax-preference</code>.  This is because Viper doesn't change
syntax tables in fear of upsetting the various major modes that set these
tables.

   <p><a name="index-textmarkers-100"></a>
Textmarkers in Viper remember the file and the position, so that you can
switch files by simply doing <kbd>'a</kbd>.  If you set up a regimen for using
Textmarkers, this is very useful.  Contents of textmarkers can be viewed
by <kbd>[marker</kbd>.  (Contents of registers can be viewed by <kbd>]register</kbd>).
