<h3 class="section">3.3 Lesson III: User and Library Catalogs</h3>

<p>We have already used the routine info display in the first part of this
tutorial.  This was the invoked using <kbd>C-c ?</kbd>, and displays
information about the IDL routine near the cursor position.  Wouldn't it
be nice to have the same kind of information available for your own
routines and for the huge amount of code in major libraries like JHUPL
or the IDL-Astro library?  In many cases, you may already have this
information.  Files named <samp><span class="file">.idlwave_catalog</span></samp> in library directories
contain scanned information on the routines in that directory; many
popular libraries ship with these &ldquo;library catalogs&rdquo; pre-scanned. 
Users can scan their own routines in one of two ways: either using the
supplied tool to scan directories and build their own
<samp><span class="file">.idlwave_catalog</span></samp> files, or using the built-in method to create a
single &ldquo;user catalog&rdquo;, which we'll show here.  See <a href="Catalogs.html#Catalogs">Catalogs</a>, for
more information on choosing which method to use.

   <p>To build a user catalog, select <code>Routine Info/Select Catalog
Directories</code> from the IDLWAVE entry in the menu bar.  If necessary,
start the shell first with <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd> (see <a href="Starting-the-Shell.html#Starting-the-Shell">Starting the Shell</a>). 
IDLWAVE will find out about the IDL <code>!PATH</code> variable and offer a
list of directories on the path.  Simply select them all (or whichever
you want &mdash; directories with existing library catalogs will not be
selected by default) and click on the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Scan&amp;Save</span></samp>&rsquo; button.  Then
go for a cup of coffee while IDLWAVE collects information for each and
every IDL routine on your search path.  All this information is
written to the file <samp><span class="file">.idlwave/idlusercat.el</span></samp> in your home
directory and will from now on automatically load whenever you use
IDLWAVE.  You may find it necessary to rebuild the catalog on occasion
as your local libraries change, or build a library catalog for those
directories instead.  Invoke routine info (<kbd>C-c ?</kbd>) or completion
(<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>) on any routine or partial routine name you know to
be located in the library.  E.g., if you have scanned the IDL-Astro
library:

<pre class="example">         a=readf&lt;M-&lt;TAB&gt;&gt;
</pre>
   <p>expands to `readfits('.  Then try

<pre class="example">         a=readfits(&lt;C-c ?&gt;
</pre>
   <p>and you get:

<pre class="example">     Usage:    Result = READFITS(filename, header, heap)
     ...
</pre>
   <p>I hope you made it until here.  Now you are set to work with IDLWAVE. 
On the way you will want to change other things, and to learn more
about the possibilities not discussed in this short tutorial.  Read
the manual, look at the documentation strings of interesting variables
(with <kbd>C-h v idlwave&lt;-variable-name&gt; &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>) and ask the
remaining questions on the newsgroup <code>comp.lang.idl-pvwave</code>.
