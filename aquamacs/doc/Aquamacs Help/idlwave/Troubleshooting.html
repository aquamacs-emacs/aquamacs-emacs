<h2 class="appendix">Appendix E Troubleshooting</h2>

<p><a name="index-Troubleshooting-399"></a>
Although IDLWAVE usually installs and works without difficulty, a few
common problems and their solutions are documented below.

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li><strong>Whenever an IDL error occurs or a breakpoint is hit, I get
errors or strange behavior when I try to type anything into some of my
IDLWAVE buffers.</strong>

     <p>This is a <em>feature</em>, not an error.  You're in <em>Electric
Debug Mode</em> (see <a href="Electric-Debug-Mode.html#Electric-Debug-Mode">Electric Debug Mode</a>).  You should see
<code>*Debugging*</code> in the mode-line.  The buffer is read-only and all
debugging and examination commands are available as single keystrokes;
<kbd>C-?</kbd> lists these shortcuts.  Use <kbd>q</kbd> to quit the mode, and
customize the variable <code>idlwave-shell-automatic-electric-debug</code>
if you prefer not to enter electric debug on breakpoints<small class="dots">...</small> but
you really should try it before you disable it!  You can also
customize this variable to enter debug mode when errors are
encountered.

     <li><strong>I get errors like &lsquo;</strong><samp><span class="samp">Searching for program: no such
file or directory, idl</span></samp><strong>&rsquo; when attempting to start the IDL shell.</strong>

     <p>IDLWAVE needs to know where IDL is in order to run it as a process. 
By default, it attempts to invoke it simply as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idl</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
presumes such an executable is on your search path.  You need to
ensure &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idl</span></samp>&rsquo; is on your &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$PATH</span></samp>&rsquo;, or specify the full
pathname to the idl program with the variable
<code>idlwave-shell-explicit-file-name</code>.  Note that you may need to
set your shell search path in two places when running Emacs as an Aqua
application with MacOSX; see the next topic.

     <li><strong>IDLWAVE is disregarding my &lsquo;</strong><samp><span class="samp">IDL_PATH</span></samp><strong>&rsquo; which I set
under MacOSX</strong>

     <p>If you run Emacs directly as an Aqua application, rather than from the
console shell, the environment is set not from your usual shell
configuration files (e.g. <samp><span class="file">.cshrc</span></samp>), but from the file
<samp><span class="file">~/.MacOSX/environment.plist</span></samp>.  Either include your path settings
there, or start Emacs and IDLWAVE from the shell.

     <li><strong>I get errors like &lsquo;</strong><samp><span class="samp">Symbol's function is void:
overlayp</span></samp><strong>&rsquo;</strong>

     <p>You don't have the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fsf-compat</span></samp>&rsquo; package installed, which IDLWAVE
needs to run under XEmacs.  Install it, or find an XEmacs distribution
which includes it by default.

     <li><strong>I'm getting errors like &lsquo;</strong><samp><span class="samp">Symbol's value as variable is void:
cl-builtin-gethash</span></samp><strong>&rsquo; on completion or routine info.</strong>

     <p>This error arises if you upgraded Emacs from 20.x to 21.x without
re-installing IDLWAVE.  Old Emacs and new Emacs are not byte-compatible
in compiled lisp files.  Presumably, you kept the original .elc files in
place, and this is the source of the error.  If you recompile (or just
"make; make install") from source, it should resolve this problem. 
Another option is to recompile the <samp><span class="file">idlw*.el</span></samp> files by hand using
<kbd>M-x byte-compile-file</kbd>.

     <li><kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><strong> doesn't complete words, it switches
windows on my desktop.</strong>

     <p>Your system is trapping <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> and using it for its own
nefarious purposes: Emacs never sees the keystrokes.  On many Unix
systems, you can reconfigure your window manager to use another key
sequence for switching among windows.  Another option is to use the
equivalent sequence <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.

     <li><strong>When stopping at breakpoints or errors, IDLWAVE does not
seem to highlight the relevant line in the source.</strong>

     <p>IDLWAVE scans for error and halt messages and highlights the stop
location in the correct file.  However, if you've changed the system
variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!ERROR_STATE.MSG_PREFIX</span></samp>&rsquo;, it is unable to parse these
message correctly.  Don't do that.

     <li><strong>IDLWAVE doesn't work correctly when using ENVI.</strong>

     <p>Though IDLWAVE was not written with ENVI in mind, it works just fine
with it, as long as you update the prompt it's looking for (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IDL&gt;
</span></samp>&rsquo; by default).  You can do this with the variable
<code>idlwave-shell-prompt-pattern</code> (see <a href="Starting-the-Shell.html#Starting-the-Shell">Starting the Shell</a>), e.g.,
in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq idlwave-shell-prompt-pattern "^\r? ?\\(ENVI\\|IDL\\)&gt; ")
</pre>
     <li><strong>Attempts to set breakpoints fail: no breakpoint is
indicated in the IDLWAVE buffer.</strong>

     <p>IDL changed its breakpoint reporting format starting with IDLv5.5.  The
first version of IDLWAVE to support the new format is IDLWAVE v4.10.  If
you have an older version and are using IDL &gt;v5.5, you need to upgrade,
and/or make sure your recent version of IDLWAVE is being found on the
Emacs load-path (see the next entry).  You can list the version being
used with <kbd>C-h v idlwave-mode-version &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

     <li><strong>I installed a new version of IDLWAVE, but the old
version is still being used</strong> or <strong>IDLWAVE works, but when I
tried to install the optional modules </strong><samp><span class="file">idlw-roprompt.el</span></samp><strong> or
</strong><samp><span class="file">idlw-complete-structtag</span></samp><strong>, I get errors like &lsquo;</strong><samp><span class="samp">Cannot open
load file</span></samp><strong>&rsquo;</strong>.

     <p>The problem is that your Emacs is not finding the version of IDLWAVE you
installed.  Many Emacsen come with an older bundled copy of IDLWAVE
(e.g. v4.7 for Emacs 21.x), which is likely what's being used instead. 
You need to make sure your Emacs <em>load-path</em> contains the directory
where IDLWAVE is installed (<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp</span></samp>, by
default), <em>before</em> Emacs' default search directories.  You can
accomplish this by putting the following in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq load-path (cons "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp" load-path))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">You can check on your load-path value using <kbd>C-h v
load-path &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, and <kbd>C-h m</kbd> in an IDLWAVE buffer should show
you the version Emacs is using.

     <li><strong>IDLWAVE is screwing up the formatting of my </strong><samp><span class="file">.idl</span></samp><strong> files.</strong>

     <p>Actually, this isn't IDLWAVE at all, but &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idl-mode</span></samp>&rsquo;, an unrelated
programming mode for CORBA's Interface Definition Language (you should
see &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(IDL)</span></samp>&rsquo;, not &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(IDLWAVE)</span></samp>&rsquo; in the mode-line).  One
solution: don't name your file <samp><span class="file">.idl</span></samp>, but rather <samp><span class="file">.pro</span></samp>. 
Another solution: make sure <samp><span class="file">.idl</span></samp> files load IDLWAVE instead of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idl-mode</span></samp>&rsquo; by adding the following to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:

     <pre class="lisp">          (setcdr (rassoc 'idl-mode auto-mode-alist) 'idlwave-mode)
</pre>
     <li><strong>The routine info for my local routines is out of date!</strong>

     <p>IDLWAVE collects routine info from various locations (see <a href="Routine-Information-Sources.html#Routine-Information-Sources">Routine Information Sources</a>).  Routines in files visited in a buffer or
compiled in the shell should be up to date.  For other routines, the
information is only as current as the most recent scan.  If you have a
rapidly changing set of routines, and you'd like the latest routine
information to be available for it, one powerful technique is to make
use of the library catalog tool, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">idlwave_catalog</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Simply add a
line to your &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cron</span></samp>&rsquo; file (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">crontab -e</span></samp>&rsquo; will let you edit this
on some systems), like this

     <pre class="example">          45 3 * * 1-5 (cd /path/to/myidllib; /path/to/idlwave_catalog MyLib)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MyLib</span></samp>&rsquo; is the name of your library.  This will
rescan all <samp><span class="file">.pro</span></samp> files at or below <samp><span class="file">/path/to/myidllib</span></samp> every
week night at 3:45am.  You can even scan site-wide libraries with this
method, and the most recent information will be available to all users. 
Since the scanning is very fast, there is very little impact.

     <li><strong>All the Greek-font characters in the HTML help are
displayed as Latin characters!</strong>

     <p>Unfortunately, the HTMLHelp files RSI provides attempt to switch to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Symbol</span></samp>&rsquo; font to display Greek characters, which is not really an
permitted method for doing this in HTML.  There is a "workaround" for
some browsers: See <a href="HTML-Help-Browser-Tips.html#HTML-Help-Browser-Tips">HTML Help Browser Tips</a>.

     <li><strong>In the shell, my long commands are truncated at 256 characters!</strong>

     <p>This actually happens when running IDL in an XTerm as well.  There are
a couple of workarounds: <code>define_key,/control,'^d'</code> (e.g. in
your <samp><span class="file">$IDL_STARTUP</span></samp> file) will disable the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">EOF</span></samp>&rsquo; character
and give you a 512 character limit.  You won't be able to use
&lt;C-d&gt; to quit the shell, however.  Another possibility is
<code>!EDIT_INPUT=0</code>, which gives you an <em>infinite</em> limit (OK, a
memory-bounded limit), but disables the processing of background
widget events (those with <code>/NO_BLOCK</code> passed to <code>XManager</code>).

     <li><strong>When I invoke IDL HTML help on a routine, the page which
is loaded is one page off, e.g. for </strong><code>CONVERT_COORD</code><strong>, I get
</strong><code>CONTOUR</code><strong>.</strong>

     <p>You have a mismatch between your help index and the HTML help package
you downloaded.  You need to ensure you download a &ldquo;downgrade kit&rdquo; if
you are using anything older than the latest HTML help package.  A new
help package appears with each IDL release (assuming the documentation
is updated). 
Starting with IDL 6.2, the HTML help and its catalog are
distributed with IDL, and so should never be inconsistent.

     <li><strong>I get errors such as &lsquo;</strong><samp><span class="samp">void-variable
browse-url-browser-function</span></samp><strong>&rsquo; or similar when attempting to load IDLWAVE
under XEmacs.</strong>

     <p>You don't have the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">browse-url</span></samp>&rsquo; (or other required) XEmacs package. 
Unlike GNU Emacs, XEmacs distributes many packages separately from the
main program.  IDLWAVE is actually among these, but is not always the
most up to date.  When installing IDLWAVE as an XEmacs package, it
should prompt you for required additional packages.  When installing it
from source, it won't and you'll get this error.  The easiest solution
is to install all the packages when you install XEmacs (the so-called
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sumo</span></samp>&rsquo; bundle).  The minimum set of XEmacs packages required by
IDLWAVE is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fsf-compat, xemacs-base, mail-lib</span></samp>&rsquo;.

        </ol>
