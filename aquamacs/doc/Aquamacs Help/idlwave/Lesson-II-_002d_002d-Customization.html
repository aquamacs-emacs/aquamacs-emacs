<h3 class="section">3.2 Lesson II: Customization</h3>

<p>Emacs is probably the most customizable piece of software ever written,
and it would be a shame if you did not make use of this to adapt IDLWAVE
to your own preferences.  Customizing Emacs or IDLWAVE is accomplished
by setting Lisp variables in the <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file in your home
directory &mdash; but do not be dismayed; for the most part, you can just
copy and work from the examples given here.

   <p>Let's first use a boolean variable.  These are variables which you turn
on or off, much like a checkbox. A value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo; means on, a value
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nil</span></samp>&rsquo; means off.  Copy the following line into your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, exit and restart Emacs.

<pre class="lisp">     (setq idlwave-reserved-word-upcase t)
</pre>
   <p>When this option is turned on, each reserved word you type into an IDL
source buffer will be converted to upper case when you press &lt;SPC&gt;
or &lt;RET&gt; right after the word.  Try it out!  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">if</span></samp>&rsquo; changes to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IF</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">begin</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BEGIN</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you don't like this
behavior, remove the option again from your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file and
restart Emacs.

   <p>You likely have your own indentation preferences for IDL code.  For
example, some may prefer to indent the main block of an IDL program
slightly from the margin and use only 3 spaces as indentation between
<code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code>.  Try the following lines in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq idlwave-main-block-indent 1)
     (setq idlwave-block-indent 3)
     (setq idlwave-end-offset -3)
</pre>
   <p>Restart Emacs, and re-indent the program we developed in the first part
of this tutorial with <kbd>C-c h</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-\</kbd>.  You may want to keep
these lines in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>, with values adjusted to your likings.  If
you want to get more information about any of these variables, type,
e.g., <kbd>C-h v idlwave-main-block-indent &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  To find which
variables can be customized, look for items marked &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">User Option:</span></samp>&rsquo;
throughout this manual.

   <p>If you cannot seem to master this Lisp customization in <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>,
there is another, more user-friendly way to customize all the IDLWAVE
variables.  You can access it through the IDLWAVE menu in one of the
<samp><span class="file">.pro</span></samp> buffers, menu item <code>Customize-&gt;Browse IDLWAVE
Group</code>. Here you'll be presented with all the various variables grouped
into categories.  You can navigate the hierarchy (e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IDLWAVE
Code Formatting-&gt;Idlwave Abbrev And Indent Action-&gt;Idlwave Expand
Generic End</span></samp>&rsquo; to turn on <code>END</code> expansion), read about the variables,
change them, and `Save for Future Sessions'.  Few of these variables
need customization, but you can exercise considerable control over
IDLWAVE's functionality with them.

   <p>You may also find the key bindings used for the debugging commands too
long and complicated.  Often we have heard complaints along the lines
of, &ldquo;Do I really have to go through the finger gymnastics of <kbd>C-c
C-d C-c</kbd> to run a simple command?&rdquo;  Due to Emacs rules and
conventions, shorter bindings cannot be set by default, but you can
easily enable them.  First, there is a way to assign all debugging
commands in a single sweep to another simpler combination.  The only
problem is that we have to use something which Emacs does not need for
other important commands.  One good option is to execute debugging
commands by holding down &lt;CONTROL&gt; and &lt;SHIFT&gt; while pressing
a single character: <kbd>C-S-b</kbd> for setting a breakpoint, <kbd>C-S-c</kbd>
for compiling the current source file, <kbd>C-S-a</kbd> for deleting all
breakpoints (try it, it's easier).  You can enable this with:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(shift control))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you have a special keyboard with, for example, a
&lt;SUPER&gt; key, you could even shorten that:

<pre class="lisp">     (setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(super))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to get compilation on <kbd>S-c</kbd>.  Often, a modifier key like
&lt;SUPER&gt; or &lt;HYPER&gt; is bound or can be bound to an otherwise
unused key on your keyboard &mdash; consult your system documentation.

   <p>You can also assign specific commands to keys.  This you must do in the
<em>mode-hook</em>, a special function which is run when a new IDLWAVE
buffer gets set up.  The possibilities for key customization are
endless.  Here we set function keys f4-f8 to common debugging commands.

<pre class="lisp">     ;; First for the source buffer
     (add-hook 'idlwave-mode-hook
        (lambda ()
         (local-set-key [f4] 'idlwave-shell-retall)
         (local-set-key [f5] 'idlwave-shell-break-here)
         (local-set-key [f6] 'idlwave-shell-clear-current-bp)
         (local-set-key [f7] 'idlwave-shell-cont)
         (local-set-key [f8] 'idlwave-shell-clear-all-bp)))
     ;; Then for the shell buffer
     (add-hook 'idlwave-shell-mode-hook
        (lambda ()
         (local-set-key [f4] 'idlwave-shell-retall)
         (local-set-key [f5] 'idlwave-shell-break-here)
         (local-set-key [f6] 'idlwave-shell-clear-current-bp)
         (local-set-key [f7] 'idlwave-shell-cont)
         (local-set-key [f8] 'idlwave-shell-clear-all-bp)))
</pre>
