<h2 class="appendix">Appendix D Windows and MacOS</h2>

<p><a name="index-Windows-396"></a><a name="index-MacOS-397"></a><a name="index-MacOSX-398"></a>
IDLWAVE was developed on a UNIX system.  However, thanks to the
portability of Emacs, much of IDLWAVE does also work under different
operating systems like Windows (with NTEmacs or NTXEmacs) or MacOS.

   <p>The only real problem is that there is no command-line version of IDL
for Windows or MacOS(&lt;=9) with which IDLWAVE can interact.  As a
result, the IDLWAVE Shell does not work and you have to rely on IDLDE
to run and debug your programs.  However, editing IDL source files
with Emacs/IDLWAVE works with all bells and whistles, including
routine info, completion and fast online help.  Only a small amount of
additional information must be specified in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:
the path names which, on a UNIX system, are automatically gathered by
talking to the IDL program.

   <p>Here is an example of the additional configuration needed for a Windows
system.  I am assuming that IDLWAVE has been installed in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C:\Program&nbsp;Files\IDLWAVE</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> and that IDL is installed in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C:\RSI\IDL63</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.

<pre class="lisp">     ;; location of the lisp files (only needed if IDLWAVE is not part of
     ;; your default X/Emacs installation)
     (setq load-path (cons "c:/program files/IDLWAVE" load-path))
     
     ;; The location of the IDL library directories, both standard,  and your own.
     ;; note that the initial "+" expands the path recursively
     (setq idlwave-library-path
             '("+c:/RSI/IDL63/lib/" "+c:/path/to/my/idllibs" ))
     
     ;; location of the IDL system directory (try "print,!DIR")
     (setq idlwave-system-directory "c:/RSI/IDL63/")
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Furthermore, Windows sometimes tries to outsmart you &mdash; make
sure you check the following things:

     <ul>
<li>When you download the IDLWAVE distribution, make sure you save the
file under the names <samp><span class="file">idlwave.tar.gz</span></samp>. 
<li>M-TAB switches among running programs &mdash; use Esc-TAB
instead. 
<li>Other issues as yet unnamed... 
</ul>

   <p>Windows users who'd like to make use of IDLWAVE's context-aware HTML
help can skip the browser and use the HTMLHelp functionality directly.
