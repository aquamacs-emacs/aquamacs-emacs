<h3 class="section">5.5 Examining Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bPRINT_007d-expressions-319"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bHELP_007d_002c-on-expressions-320"></a><a name="index-Expressions_002c-printing-_0026-help-321"></a><a name="index-Examining-expressions-322"></a><a name="index-Printing-expressions-323"></a><a name="index-Mouse-binding-to-print-expressions-324"></a>
<a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dd-C_002dp-325"></a>Do you find yourself repeatedly typing, e.g. <code>print,n_elements(x)</code>,
and similar statements to remind yourself of the
type/size/structure/value/etc. of variables and expressions in your code
or at the command line?  IDLWAVE has a suite of special commands to
automate these types of variable or expression examinations.  They work
by sending statements to the shell formatted to include the indicated
expression, and can be accessed in several ways.

   <p>These <em>examine</em> commands can be used in the shell or buffer at any
time (as long as the shell is running), and are very useful when
execution is stopped in a buffer due to a triggered breakpoint or error,
or while composing a long command in the IDLWAVE shell.  In the latter
case, the command is sent to the shell and its output is visible, but
point remains unmoved in the command being composed &mdash; you can inspect
the constituents of a command you're building without interrupting the
process of building it!  You can even print arbitrary expressions from
older input or output further up in the shell window &mdash; any expression,
variable, number, or function you see can be examined.

   <p>If the variable <code>idlwave-shell-separate-examine-output</code> is
non-<code>nil</code> (the default), all examine output will be sent to a
special <samp><span class="file">*Examine*</span></samp> buffer, rather than the shell.  The output of
prior examine commands is saved in this buffer.  In this buffer &lt;c&gt;
clears the contents, and &lt;q&gt; hides the buffer.

   <p>The two most basic examine commands are bound to <kbd>C-c C-d C-p</kbd>, to
print the expression at point, and <kbd>C-c C-d ?</kbd>, to invoke help on
this expression<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  The expression at point is
either an array expression or a function call, or the contents of a pair
of parentheses.  The chosen expression is highlighted, and
simultaneously the resulting output is highlighted in the shell or
separate output buffer.  Calling the above commands with a prefix
argument will use the current region as expression instead of using the
one at point. which can be useful for examining complicated, multi-line
expressions.  Two prefix arguments (<kbd>C-u C-u C-c C-d C-p</kbd>) will
prompt for an expression to print directly.  By default, when invoking
print, only an initial portion of long arrays will be printed, up to
<code>idlwave-shell-max-print-length</code>.

   <p>For added speed and convenience, there are mouse bindings which allow
you to click on expressions and examine their values.  Use
<kbd>S-Mouse-2</kbd> to print an expression and <kbd>C-M-Mouse-2</kbd> to invoke
help (i.e. you need to hold down &lt;META&gt; and &lt;CONTROL&gt; while
clicking with the middle mouse button).  If you simply click, the
nearest expression will be selected in the same manner as described
above.  You can also <em>drag</em> the mouse in order to highlight
exactly the specific expression or sub-expression you want to examine. 
For custom expression examination, and the powerful customizable
pop-up examine selection, See <a href="Custom-Expression-Examination.html#Custom-Expression-Examination">Custom Expression Examination</a>.

   <p><a name="index-Printing-expressions_002c-on-calling-stack-326"></a><a name="index-Restrictions-for-expression-printing-327"></a>The same variable inspection commands work both in the IDL Shell and
IDLWAVE buffers, and even for variables at higher levels of the calling
stack.  For instance, if you're stopped at a breakpoint in a routine,
you can examine the values of variables and expressions inside its
calling routine, and so on, all the way up through the calling stack. 
Simply step up the stack, and print variables as you see them
(see <a href="Walking-the-Calling-Stack.html#Walking-the-Calling-Stack">Walking the Calling Stack</a>, for information on stepping back
through the calling stack).  The following restrictions apply for all
levels except the current:

     <ul>
<li>Array expressions must use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ ]</span></samp>&rsquo; index delimiters.  Identifiers
with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">( )</span></samp>&rsquo; will be interpreted as function calls. 
<li><a name="index-ROUTINE_005fNAMES_002c-IDL-procedure-328"></a>N.B.: printing values of expressions on higher levels of the calling
stack uses the <em>unsupported</em> IDL routine <code>ROUTINE_NAMES</code>,
which may or may not be available in future versions of IDL.  Caveat
Examinor. 
</ul>
