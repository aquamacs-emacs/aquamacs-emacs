<h4 class="appendixsubsec">A.3.1 Library Catalogs</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002eidlwave_005fcatalog_007d-364"></a><a name="index-Library-catalogs-365"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bidlwave_005fcatalog_007d-366"></a>
Library catalogs consist of files named <samp><span class="file">.idlwave_catalog</span></samp> stored
in directories containing <code>.pro</code> routine files.  They are
discovered on the IDL search path and loaded automatically when routine
information is read.  Each catalog file documents the routines found in
that directory &mdash; one catalog per directory.  Every catalog has a
library name associated with it (e.g. <em>AstroLib</em>).  This name will
be shown briefly when the catalog is found, and in the routine info of
routines it documents.

   <p>Many popular libraries of routines are shipped with IDLWAVE catalog
files by default, and so will be automatically discovered.  Library
catalogs are scanned externally to Emacs using a tool provided with
IDLWAVE.  Each catalog can be re-scanned independently of any other. 
Catalogs can easily be made available system-wide with a common source
repository, providing uniform routine information, and lifting the
burden of scanning from the user (who may not even know they're using a
scanned catalog).  Since all catalogs are independent, they can be
re-scanned automatically to gather updates, e.g. in a <samp><span class="file">cron</span></samp> job. 
Scanning is much faster than with the built-in user catalog method.  One
minor disadvantage: the entire IDL search path is scanned for catalog
files every time IDLWAVE starts up, which might be slow if accessing IDL
routines over a slow network.

   <p>A Perl tool to create library catalogs is distributed with IDLWAVE:
<code>idlwave_catalog</code>.  It can be called quite simply:
<pre class="example">     idlwave_catalog MyLib
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will scan all directories recursively beneath the current and
populate them with <samp><span class="file">.idlwave_catalog</span></samp> files, tagging the routines
found there with the name library &ldquo;MyLib&rdquo;.  The full usage
information:

<pre class="example">     Usage: idlwave_catalog  [-l] [-v] [-d] [-s] [-f] [-h] libname
            libname - Unique name of the catalog (4 or more alphanumeric
                      characters).
                 -l - Scan local directory only, otherwise recursively
                      catalog all directories at or beneath this one.
                 -v - Print verbose information.
                 -d - Instead of scanning, delete all .idlwave_catalog files
                      here or below.
                 -s - Be silent.
                 -f - Force overwriting any catalogs found with a different
                      library name.
                 -h - Print this usage.
</pre>
   <p>To re-load the library catalogs on the IDL path, force a system routine
info update using a single prefix to <code>idlwave-update-routine-info</code>:
<kbd>C-u C-c C-i</kbd>.
