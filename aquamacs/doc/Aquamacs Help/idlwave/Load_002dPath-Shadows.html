<h3 class="appendixsec">A.4 Load-Path Shadows</h3>

<p><a name="index-Load_002dpath-shadows-375"></a><a name="index-Shadows_002c-load_002dpath-376"></a><a name="index-Duplicate-routines-377"></a><a name="index-Multiply-defined-routines-378"></a><a name="index-Routine-definitions_002c-multiple-379"></a><a name="index-Application_002c-testing-for-shadowing-380"></a><a name="index-Buffer_002c-testing-for-shadowing-381"></a>
IDLWAVE can compile a list of routines which are (re-)defined in more
than one file.  Since one definition will hide (shadow) the others
depending on which file is compiled first, such multiple definitions are
called "load-path shadows".  IDLWAVE has several routines to scan for
load path shadows.  The output is placed into the special buffer
<samp><span class="file">*Shadows*</span></samp>.  The format of the output is identical to the source
section of the routine info buffer (see <a href="Routine-Info.html#Routine-Info">Routine Info</a>).  The
different definitions of a routine are ordered by <em>likelihood of
use</em>.  So the first entry will be most likely the one you'll get if an
unsuspecting command uses that routine.  Before listing shadows, you
should make sure that routine info is up-to-date by pressing <kbd>C-c
C-i</kbd>.  Here are the different routines (also available in the Menu
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IDLWAVE-&gt;Routine Info</span></samp>&rsquo;):

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x idlwave-list-buffer-load-path-shadows</kbd><dd>This command checks the names of all routines defined in the current
buffer for shadowing conflicts with other routines accessible to
IDLWAVE.  The command also has a key binding: <kbd>C-c C-b</kbd>
<br><dt><kbd>M-x idlwave-list-shell-load-path-shadows</kbd>.<dd>Checks all routines compiled under the shell for shadowing.  This is
very useful when you have written a complete application.  Just compile
the application, use <code>RESOLVE_ALL</code> to compile any routines used by
your code, update the routine info inside IDLWAVE with <kbd>C-c C-i</kbd> and
then check for shadowing. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x idlwave-list-all-load-path-shadows</kbd><dd>This command checks all routines accessible to IDLWAVE for conflicts. 
</dl>

   <p>For these commands to work fully you need to scan the entire load path
in either a user or library catalog.  Also, IDLWAVE should be able to
distinguish between the system library files (normally installed in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/rsi/idl/lib</span></samp>) and any site specific or user specific
files.  Therefore, such local files should not be installed inside the
<samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> directory of the IDL directory.  This is also advisable for
many other reasons.

   <p><a name="index-Windows-382"></a><a name="index-MacOS-383"></a><a name="index-IDL-variable-_0040code_007b_0021DIR_007d-384"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0021DIR_007d_002c-IDL-variable-385"></a>Users of Windows and MacOS (not X) also must set the variable
<code>idlwave-system-directory</code> to the value of the <code>!DIR</code> system
variable in IDL.  IDLWAVE appends <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> to the value of this
variable and assumes that all files found on that path are system
routines.

   <p>Another way to find out if a specific routine has multiple definitions
on the load path is routine info display (see <a href="Routine-Info.html#Routine-Info">Routine Info</a>).
