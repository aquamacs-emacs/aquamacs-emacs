IDLWAVE is a package which supports editing source files written in
the Interactive Data Language (IDL), and running IDL as an inferior shell<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  It is a feature-rich replacement for the IDLDE
development environment included with IDL, and uses the full power of
Emacs to make editing and running IDL programs easier, quicker, and more
structured.

   <p>IDLWAVE consists of two main parts: a major mode for editing IDL
source files (<code>idlwave-mode</code>) and a mode for running the IDL
program as an inferior shell (<code>idlwave-shell-mode</code>).  Although
one mode can be used without the other, both work together closely to
form a complete development environment. Here is a brief summary of
what IDLWAVE does:

     <ul>
<li>Smart code indentation and automatic-formatting. 
<li>Three level syntax highlighting support. 
<li>Context-sensitive display of calling sequences and keywords for more
than 1000 native IDL routines, extendible to any additional number of
local routines, and already available with many pre-scanned libraries. 
<li>Fast, context-sensitive online HTML help, or source-header help for
undocumented routines. 
<li>Context sensitive completion of routine names, keywords, system
variables, class names and much more. 
<li>Easy insertion of code templates and abbreviations of common constructs. 
<li>Automatic corrections to enforce a variety of customizable coding
standards. 
<li>Integrity checks and auto-termination of logical blocks. 
<li>Routine name space conflict search with likelihood-of-use ranking. 
<li>Support for <samp><span class="file">imenu</span></samp> (Emacs) and <samp><span class="file">func-menu</span></samp> (XEmacs). 
<li>Documentation support. 
<li>Running IDL as an inferior Shell with history search, command line
editing and all the completion and routine info capabilities present in
IDL source buffers. 
<li>Full handling of debugging with breakpoints, with interactive setting
of break conditions, and easy stepping through code. 
<li>Compilation, execution and interactive single-keystroke debugging of
programs directly from the source buffer. 
<li>Quick, source-guided navigation of the calling stack, with variable
inspection, etc. 
<li>Examining variables and expressions with a mouse click. 
<li>And much, much more... 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-Screenshots-9"></a>Here are a number of screenshots showing IDLWAVE in action:

<li><a href="http://idlwave.org/screenshots/emacs_21_bp.gif">Debugging code stopped at a breakpoint</a>
</ul>

   <p>IDLWAVE is the distant successor to the <samp><span class="file">idl.el</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">idl-shell.el</span></samp> files written by Chris Chase.  The modes and files
had to be renamed because of a name space conflict with CORBA's
<code>idl-mode</code>, defined in Emacs in the file <samp><span class="file">cc-mode.el</span></samp>.

   <p>In this manual, each section ends with a list of related user options. 
Don't be confused by the sheer number of options available &mdash; in most
cases the default settings are just fine.  The variables are listed here
to make sure you know where to look if you want to change anything.  For
a full description of what a particular variable does and how to
configure it, see the documentation string of that variable (available
with <kbd>C-h v</kbd>).  Some configuration examples are also given in the
appendix.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> IDLWAVE can also be used
for editing source files for the related WAVE/CL language, but with only
limited support.</p>
