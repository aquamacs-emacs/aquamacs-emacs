<h3 class="section">3.1 Lesson I: Development Cycle</h3>

<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to guide you through a very basic
development cycle using IDLWAVE.  We will paste a simple program into
a buffer and use the shell to compile, debug and run it.  On the way
we will use many of the important IDLWAVE commands.  Note, however,
that IDLWAVE has many more capabilities than covered here, which can
be discovered by reading the entire manual, or hovering over the
shoulder of your nearest IDLWAVE guru for a few days.

   <p>It is assumed that you have access to Emacs or XEmacs with the full
IDLWAVE package including online help.  We also assume that you are
familiar with Emacs and can read the nomenclature of key presses in
Emacs (in particular, <kbd>C</kbd> stands for &lt;CONTROL&gt; and <kbd>M</kbd> for
&lt;META&gt; (often the &lt;ALT&gt; key carries this functionality)).

   <p>Open a new source file by typing:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>C-x C-f tutorial.pro &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>A buffer for this file will pop up, and it should be in IDLWAVE mode,
indicated in the mode line just below the editing window.  Also, the
menu bar should contain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IDLWAVE</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Now cut-and-paste the following code, also available as
<samp><span class="file">tutorial.pro</span></samp> in the IDLWAVE distribution.

<pre class="example">     function daynr,d,m,y
       ;; compute a sequence number for a date
       ;; works 1901-2099.
       if y lt 100 then y = y+1900
       if m le 2 then delta = 1 else delta = 0
       m1 = m + delta*12 + 1
       y1 = y * delta
       return, d + floor(m1*30.6)+floor(y1*365.25)+5
     end
     
     function weekday,day,month,year
       ;; compute weekday number for date
       nr = daynr(day,month,year)
       return, nr mod 7
     end
     
     pro plot_wday,day,month
       ;; Plot the weekday of a date in the first 10 years of this century.
       years = 2000,+indgen(10)
       wdays = intarr(10)
       for i=0,n_elements(wdays)-1 do begin
           wdays[i] =  weekday(day,month,years[i])
       end
       plot,years,wdays,YS=2,YT="Wday (0=Sunday)"
     end
</pre>
   <p>The indentation probably looks funny, since it's different from the
settings you use, so use the &lt;TAB&gt; key in each line to
automatically line it up (or, more quickly, <em>select</em> the entire
buffer with <kbd>C-x h</kbd>, and indent the whole region with
<kbd>C-M-\</kbd>).  Notice how different syntactical elements are
highlighted in different colors, if you have set up support for
font-lock.

   <p>Let's check out two particular editing features of IDLWAVE.  Place the
cursor after the <code>end</code> statement of the <code>for</code> loop and press
&lt;SPC&gt;.  IDLWAVE blinks back to the beginning of the block and
changes the generic <code>end</code> to the specific <code>endfor</code>
automatically (as long as the variable <code>idlwave-expand-generic-end</code>
is turned on &mdash; see <a href="Lesson-II-_002d_002d-Customization.html#Lesson-II-_002d_002d-Customization">Lesson II &ndash; Customization</a>).  Now place the
cursor in any line you would like to split and press <kbd>M-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
The line is split at the cursor position, with the continuation &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;
and indentation all taken care of.  Use <kbd>C-/</kbd> to undo the last
change.

   <p>The procedure <code>plot_wday</code> is supposed to plot the day of the week
of a given date for the first 10 years of the 21st century.  As in
most code, there are a few bugs, which we are going to use IDLWAVE to
help us fix.

   <p>First, let's launch the IDLWAVE shell.  You do this with the command
<kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>.  The Emacs window will split or another window will popup
to display IDL running in a shell interaction buffer.  Type a few
commands like <code>print,!PI</code> to convince yourself that you can work
there just as well as in a terminal, or the IDLDE.  Use the arrow keys
to cycle through your command history.  Are we having fun now?

   <p>Now go back to the source window and type <kbd>C-c C-d C-c</kbd> to compile
the program.  If you watch the shell buffer, you see that IDLWAVE types
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.run "tutorial.pro"</span></samp>&rsquo; for you.  But the compilation fails because
there is a comma in the line &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">years=...</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The line with the error
is highlighted and the cursor positioned at the error, so remove the
comma (you should only need to hit <kbd>Delete</kbd>!).  Compile again, using
the same keystrokes as before.  Notice that the file is automatically
saved for you.  This time everything should work fine, and you should
see the three routines compile.

   <p>Now we want to use the command to plot the day of the week on January
1st.  We could type the full command ourselves, but why do that?  Go
back to the shell window, type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plot_</span></samp>&rsquo; and hit &lt;TAB&gt;.  After
a bit of a delay (while IDLWAVE initializes its routine info database,
if necessary), the window will split to show all procedures it knows
starting with that string, and <code>plot_wday</code><!-- /@w --> should be one of
them.  Saving the buffer alerted IDLWAVE about this new routine. 
Click with the middle mouse button on <code>plot_wday</code> and it will be
copied to the shell buffer, or if you prefer, add &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo; to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plot_</span></samp>&rsquo; to make it unambiguous (depending on what other routines
starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">plot_</span></samp>&rsquo; you have installed on your system), hit
&lt;TAB&gt; again, and the full routine name will be completed.  Now
provide the two arguments:

<pre class="example">     plot_wday,1,1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and press &lt;RET&gt;.  This fails with an error message telling
you the <code>YT</code> keyword to plot is ambiguous.  What are the allowed
keywords again?  Go back to the source window and put the cursor into
the `plot' line and press <kbd>C-c ?</kbd>.  This shows the routine info
window for the plot routine, which contains a list of keywords, along
with the argument list.  Oh, we wanted <code>YTITLE</code>.  Fix that up. 
Recompile with <kbd>C-c C-d C-c</kbd>. Jump back into the shell with
<kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>, press the &lt;UP&gt; arrow to recall the previous command
and execute again.

   <p>This time we get a plot, but it is pretty ugly &mdash; the points are all
connected with a line.  Hmm, isn't there a way for <code>plot</code> to use
symbols instead?  What was that keyword?  Position the cursor on the
plot line after a comma (where you'd normally type a keyword), and hit
<kbd>M-&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd>.  A long list of plot's keywords appears.  Aha,
there it is, <code>PSYM</code>.  Middle click to insert it.  An &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo;
sign is included for you too.  Now what were the values of <code>PSYM</code>
supposed to be?  With the cursor on or after the keyword, press
<kbd>M-?</kbd> for online help (alternatively, you could have right clicked
on the colored keyword itself in the completion list).  A browser will
pop up showing the HTML documentation for the <code>PYSM</code> keyword. 
OK, let's use diamonds=4.  Fix this, recompile (you know the command
by now: <kbd>C-c C-d C-c</kbd>), go back to the shell (if it's vanished,
you know what to do: <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>) and execute again.  Now things
look pretty good.

   <p>Let's try a different day &mdash; how about April fool's day?

<pre class="example">     plot_wday,1,4
</pre>
   <p>Oops, this looks very wrong.  All April Fool's days cannot be Fridays! 
We've got a bug in the program, perhaps in the <code>daynr</code> function. 
Let's put a breakpoint on the last line there.  Position the cursor on
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">return, d+...</span></samp>&rsquo; line and press <kbd>C-c C-d C-b</kbd>.  IDL sets a
breakpoint (as you see in the shell window), and the break line is
indicated.  Back to the shell buffer, re-execute the previous command. 
IDL stops at the line with the breakpoint.  Now hold down the SHIFT
key and click with the middle mouse button on a few variables there:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y1</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc.  Maybe <code>d</code> isn't
the correct type.  CONTROL-SHIFT middle-click on it for help.  Well,
it's an integer, so that's not the problem.  Aha, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y1</span></samp>&rsquo; is zero,
but it should be the year, depending on delta.  Shift click
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">delta</span></samp>&rsquo; to see that it's 0.  Below, we see the offending line:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y1=y*delta...</span></samp>&rsquo; the multiplication should have been a minus sign! 
Hit <kbd>q</kbd> to exit the debugging mode, and fix the line to read:

<pre class="example">     y1 = y - delta
</pre>
   <p>Now remove all breakpoints: <kbd>C-c C-d C-a</kbd>.  Recompile and rerun the
command.  Everything should now work fine.  How about those leap years? 
Change the code to plot 100 years and see that every 28 years, the
sequence of weekdays repeats.
