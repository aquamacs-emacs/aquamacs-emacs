<h2 class="chapter">3 Installation</h2>

<p>ERC may be compiled and installed on your machine.

   <p>This section may be skipped if you are using the version of ERC that
comes with Emacs.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Compilation</h5>

<p>This is an optional step, since Emacs Lisp source code does not
necessarily have to be byte-compiled.  It will yield a speed increase,
though.

   <p>A working copy of Emacs or XEmacs is needed in order to compile ERC.  By
default, the program that is installed with the name <samp><span class="command">emacs</span></samp>
will be used.

   <p>If you want to use the <samp><span class="command">xemacs</span></samp> binary to perform the
compilation, you would need to edit <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> in the top-level
directory as follows.  You can put either a full path to an Emacs or
XEmacs binary or just the command name, as long as it is in the
<samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.

<pre class="example">     EMACS    = xemacs
     SITEFLAG = -no-site-file
</pre>
   <p>Running <code>make</code> should compile the ERC source files in the
<samp><span class="file">lisp</span></samp> directory.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Installation</h5>

<p>ERC may be installed into your file hierarchy by doing the following.

   <p>Edit the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> file so that <samp><span class="env">ELISPDIR</span></samp> points to where you
want the source and compiled ERC files to be installed and
<samp><span class="env">INFODIR</span></samp> indicates where to put the ERC manual.  Of course, you
will want to edit <samp><span class="env">EMACS</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">SITEFLAG</span></samp> as shown in the
Compilation section if you are using XEmacs.

   <p>If you are installing ERC on a Debian system, you might want to change
the value of <samp><span class="env">INSTALLINFO</span></samp> as specified in <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>.

   <p>Run <code>make</code> as a normal user.

   <p>Run <code>make install</code> as the root user if you have chosen installation
locations that require this.
