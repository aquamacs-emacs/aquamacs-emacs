<h3 class="section">4.2 Special Features</h3>

<p>ERC has some features that distinguish it from some IRC clients.

     <ul>
<li>multiple channels and multiple servers

     <p>Every channel is put in a separate buffer.  Several IRC servers may be
connected to at the same time.

     <p><a name="index-query-buffers-8"></a><li>private message separation

     <p>Private conversations are treated as channels, and are put into separate
buffers in Emacs.  We call these &ldquo;query buffers&rdquo;.

     <li>highlighting

     <p>Some occurrences of words can be highlighted, which makes it easier to
track different kinds of conversations.

     <li>notification

     <p>ERC can notify you that certain users are online.

     <li>channel tracking

     <p>Channels can be hidden and conversation continue in the background.  You
are notified when something is said in such a channel that is not
currently visible.  This makes it easy to get Real Work done while still
maintaining an IRC presence.

     <li>nick completion

     <p>ERC can complete words upon hitting <kbd>TAB</kbd>, which eases the writing
of nicknames in messages.

     <p><a name="index-history-ring-9"></a><li>history

     <p>Past actions are kept in history rings for future use.  To navigate a
history ring, hit <kbd>M-p</kbd> to go backwards and <kbd>M-n</kbd> to go
forwards.

     <li>multiple languages

     <p>Different channels and servers may have different language encodings.

     <p>In addition, it is possible to translate the messages that ERC uses into
multiple languages.  Please contact the developers of ERC at
<a href="mailto:erc-discuss@gnu.org">erc-discuss@gnu.org</a> if you are interested in helping with the
translation effort.

     <li>user scripting

     <p>Users can load scripts (e.g. auto greeting scripts) when ERC starts up.

     <p>It is also possible to make custom IRC commands, if you know a little
Emacs Lisp.  Just make an Emacs Lisp function and call it
<code>erc-cmd-NEWCOMMAND</code>, where <code>NEWCOMMAND</code> is the name of the
new command in capital letters.

     <li>auto reconnect

     <p>If the connection goes away at some point, ERC will try to reconnect
automatically.  If it fails to reconnect, and you want to try to
manually reestablish the connection at some later point, switch to an
ERC  buffer and run the <code>/RECONNECT</code> command.

   </ul>
