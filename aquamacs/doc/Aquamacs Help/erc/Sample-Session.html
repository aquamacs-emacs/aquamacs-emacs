<h3 class="section">4.1 Sample Session</h3>

<p>This is an example ERC session which shows how to connect to the #emacs
channel on Freenode.  Another IRC channel on Freenode that may be of
interest is #erc, which is a channel where ERC users and developers hang
out.

     <ul>
<li>Connect to Freenode

     <p>Run <kbd>M-x erc</kbd>.  Use &ldquo;irc.freenode.net&rdquo; as the IRC server, &ldquo;6667&rdquo;
as the port, and choose a nickname.

     <li>Get used to the interface

     <p>Switch to the &ldquo;irc.freenode.net:6667&rdquo; buffer, if you're not already
there.  You will see first some messages about checking for ident, and
then a bunch of other messages that describe the current IRC server.

     <li>Join the #emacs channel

     <p>In that buffer, type &ldquo;/join SPC #emacs&rdquo; and hit <kbd>RET</kbd>.  Depending
on how you've set up ERC, either a new buffer for &ldquo;#emacs&rdquo; will be
displayed, or a new buffer called &ldquo;#emacs&rdquo; will be created in the
background.  If the latter, switch to the &ldquo;#emacs&rdquo; buffer.  You will
see the channel topic and a list of the people who are currently on the
channel.

     <li>Register your nickname with Freenode

     <p>If you would like to be able to talk with people privately on the
Freenode network, you will have to &ldquo;register&rdquo; your nickname.  To do
so, switch to the &ldquo;irc.freenode.net:6667&rdquo; buffer and type &ldquo;/msg
NickServ register &lt;password&gt;&rdquo;, replacing &ldquo;&lt;password&gt;&rdquo; with your
desired password.  It should tell you that the operation was successful.

     <li>Talk to people in the channel

     <p>If you switch back to the &ldquo;#emacs&rdquo; buffer, you can type a message, and
everyone on the channel will see it.

     <li>Open a query buffer to talk to someone

     <p>If you want to talk with someone in private (this should usually not be
done for technical help, only for personal questions), type &ldquo;/query
&lt;nick&gt;&rdquo;, replacing &ldquo;&lt;nick&gt;&rdquo; with the nickname of the person you would
like to talk to.  Depending on how ERC is set up, you will either see a
new buffer with the name of the person, or such a buffer will be created
in the background and you will have to switch to it.  Begin typing
messages, and you will be able to have a conversation.

     <p>Note that if the other person is not registered, you will not be able to
talk with them.

   </ul>
