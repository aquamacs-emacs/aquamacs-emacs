<h2 class="chapter">9 History</h2>

<p><a name="index-history_002c-of-ERC-59"></a>
ERC was originally written by Alexander L. Belikoff
<a href="mailto:abel@bfr.co.il">abel@bfr.co.il</a> and Sergey Berezin
<a href="mailto:sergey.berezin@cs.cmu.edu">sergey.berezin@cs.cmu.edu</a>.  They stopped development around
December 1999.  Their last released version was ERC 2.0.

   <p>P.S.: If one of the original developers of ERC reads this, we'd like to
receive additional information for this file and hear comments in
general.

     <ul>
<li>2001

     <p>In June 2001, Mario Lang <a href="mailto:mlang@delysid.org">mlang@delysid.org</a> and Alex Schroeder
<a href="mailto:alex@gnu.org">alex@gnu.org</a> took over development and created a ERC Project at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/erc">http://sourceforge.net/projects/erc</a>.

     <p>In reaction to a mail about the new ERC development effort, Sergey
Berezin said, &ldquo;First of all, I'm glad that my version of ERC is being
used out there.  The thing is, I do not have free time and enough
incentive anymore to work on ERC, so I would be happy if you guys take
over the project entirely.&rdquo;

     <p>So we happily hacked away on ERC, and soon after (September 2001)
released the next "stable" version, 2.1.

     <p>Most of the development of the new ERC happened on #emacs on
irc.openprojects.net.  Over time, many people contributed code, ideas,
bugfixes, and a lot of alpha/beta/gamma testing.

     <p>See the <samp><span class="file">CREDITS</span></samp> file for a list of contributors.

     <li>2003

     <p>ERC 3.0 was released.

     <li>2004

     <p>ERC 4.0 was released.

     <li>2005

     <p>ERC 5.0 was released.  Michael Olson <a href="mailto:mwolson@gnu.org">mwolson@gnu.org</a> became
the release manager and eventually the maintainer.

     <p>After some discussion between him and the Emacs developers, it was
decided to include ERC in Emacs.

     <li>2006

     <p>ERC 5.1 was released.  It was subsequently included in Emacs 22.

     <p>ERC became an official GNU project, and development moved to
<a href="http://sv.gnu.org/projects/erc">http://sv.gnu.org/projects/erc</a>.  We switched to using GNU Arch as
our revision control system.  Our mailing list address changed as well.

     <li>2007

     <p>We switched to using git for our version control system.

   </ul>
