<h3 class="section">33.7 Customizing Dynamic Abbreviation</h3>

<p>Normally, dynamic abbrev expansion ignores case when searching for
expansions.  That is, the expansion need not agree in case with the word
you are expanding.

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dcase_002dfold_002dsearch-2634"></a>  This feature is controlled by the variable
<code>dabbrev-case-fold-search</code>.  If it is <code>t</code>, case is ignored in
this search; if it is <code>nil</code>, the word and the expansion must match
in case.  If the value of <code>dabbrev-case-fold-search</code> is
<code>case-fold-search</code>, which is true by default, then the variable
<code>case-fold-search</code> controls whether to ignore case while searching
for expansions.

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dcase_002dreplace-2635"></a>  Normally, dynamic abbrev expansion preserves the case pattern
<em>of the dynamic abbrev you are expanding</em>, by converting the
expansion to that case pattern.

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dcase_002dfold_002dsearch-2636"></a>  The variable <code>dabbrev-case-replace</code> controls whether to
preserve the case pattern of the dynamic abbrev.  If it is <code>t</code>,
the dynamic abbrev's case pattern is preserved in most cases; if it is
<code>nil</code>, the expansion is always copied verbatim.  If the value of
<code>dabbrev-case-replace</code> is <code>case-replace</code>, which is true by
default, then the variable <code>case-replace</code> controls whether to
copy the expansion verbatim.

   <p>However, if the expansion contains a complex mixed case pattern, and
the dynamic abbrev matches this pattern as far as it goes, then the
expansion is always copied verbatim, regardless of those variables. 
Thus, for example, if the buffer contains
<code>variableWithSillyCasePattern</code>, and you type <kbd>v a M-/</kbd>, it
copies the expansion verbatim including its case pattern.

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dabbrev_002dchar_002dregexp-2637"></a>  The variable <code>dabbrev-abbrev-char-regexp</code>, if non-<code>nil</code>,
controls which characters are considered part of a word, for dynamic expansion
purposes.  The regular expression must match just one character, never
two or more.  The same regular expression also determines which
characters are part of an expansion.  The value <code>nil</code> has a special
meaning: dynamic abbrevs are made of word characters, but expansions are
made of word and symbol characters.

   <p><a name="index-dabbrev_002dabbrev_002dskip_002dleading_002dregexp-2638"></a>  In shell scripts and makefiles, a variable name is sometimes prefixed
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; and sometimes not.  Major modes for this kind of text can
customize dynamic abbrev expansion to handle optional prefixes by setting
the variable <code>dabbrev-abbrev-skip-leading-regexp</code>.  Its value
should be a regular expression that matches the optional prefix that
dynamic abbrev expression should ignore.
