<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.1.4 Types of Log File</h5>

<p><a name="index-types-of-log-file-2439"></a><a name="index-log-File_002c-types-of-2440"></a><a name="index-version-control-log-2441"></a>
  Projects that use a version control system can have two types of log
for changes.  One is the log maintained by the version control system:
each time you check in a change, you fill out a <dfn>log entry</dfn> for
the change (see <a href="Log-Buffer.html#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>).  This is called the <dfn>version
control log</dfn>.

   <p>The other kind of log is the file <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> (see <a href="Change-Log.html#Change-Log">Change Log</a>).  It provides a chronological record of all changes to a large
portion of a program&mdash;typically one directory and its subdirectories. 
A small program would use one <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file; a large program
may have a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file in each major directory. 
See <a href="Change-Log.html#Change-Log">Change Log</a>.  Programmers have used change logs since long
before version control systems.

   <p>Changeset-based version systems typically maintain a changeset-based
modification log for the entire system, which makes change log files
somewhat redundant.  One advantage that they retain is that it is
sometimes useful to be able to view the transaction history of a
single directory separately from those of other directories.

   <p>A project maintained with version control can use just the version
control log, or it can use both kinds of logs.  It can handle some
files one way and some files the other way.  Each project has its
policy, which you should follow.

   <p>When the policy is to use both, you typically want to write an entry
for each change just once, then put it into both logs.  You can write
the entry in <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>, then copy it to the log buffer with
<kbd>C-c C-a</kbd> when checking in the change (see <a href="Log-Buffer.html#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>).  Or
you can write the entry in the log buffer while checking in the
change, and later use the <kbd>C-x v a</kbd> command to copy it to
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>
(see <a href="Change-Logs-and-VC.html#Change-Logs-and-VC">Change Logs and VC</a>).
