<p><a name="index-point-3"></a><a name="index-cursor-4"></a>
  The active cursor shows the location at which editing commands will
take effect, which is called <dfn>point</dfn><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Many Emacs commands move point to
different places in the buffer; for example, you can place point by
clicking mouse button 1 (normally the left button) at the desired
location.

   <p>While the cursor appears to be <em>on</em> a character, you should
think of point as <em>between</em> two characters; it points <em>before</em>
the character that appears under the cursor.  For example, if your text
looks like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">frob</span></samp>&rsquo; with the cursor over the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, then point is
between the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you insert the character
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; at that position, the result is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fro!b</span></samp>&rsquo;, with point
between the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Thus, the cursor remains over
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, as before.

   <p>Sometimes people speak of &ldquo;the cursor&rdquo; when they mean &ldquo;point,&rdquo; or
speak of commands that move point as &ldquo;cursor motion&rdquo; commands.

   <p>If you are editing several files in Emacs, each in its own buffer,
each buffer has its own point location.  A buffer that is not
currently displayed remembers its point location in case you display
it again later.  When Emacs displays multiple windows, each window has
its own point location.  If the same buffer appears in more than one
window, each window has its own point position in that buffer.

   <p>On a graphical display, Emacs shows a cursor in each window; the
selected window's cursor is solid and blinking, and the other cursors
are hollow.  On a text-only terminal, there is just one cursor, in the
selected window; even though the unselected windows have their own
point positions, they do not display a cursor.  See <a href="Cursor-Display.html#Cursor-Display">Cursor Display</a>,
for customizable variables that control cursor display.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> The term &ldquo;point&rdquo;
comes from the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;, which was the command in TECO (the
language in which the original Emacs was written) for accessing the
value now called &ldquo;point.&rdquo;</p>
