<h3 class="section">1.4 The Menu Bar</h3>

<p><a name="index-menu-bar-15"></a>
  Each Emacs frame normally has a <dfn>menu bar</dfn> at the top which you
can use to perform common operations.  There's no need to list them
here, as you can more easily see them yourself.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0060-16"></a><a name="index-F10-17"></a><a name="index-tmm_002dmenubar-18"></a><a name="index-menu_002dbar_002dopen-19"></a>  On a graphical display, you can use the mouse to choose a command
from the menu bar.  A right-arrow at the end of a menu item means it
leads to a subsidiary menu, or <dfn>submenu</dfn>.  A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo; at the end
of a menu item means that the command invoked will prompt you for
further input before it actually does anything.

   <p>Some of the commands in the menu bar have ordinary key bindings as
well; if so, a key binding is shown in parentheses after the item
itself.  To view the full command name and documentation for a menu
item, type <kbd>C-h k</kbd>, and then select the menu bar with the mouse in
the usual way (see <a href="Key-Help.html#Key-Help">Key Help</a>).

   <p>Instead of using the mouse, you can also invoke the first menu bar
item by pressing &lt;F10&gt; (to run the command <code>menu-bar-open</code>). 
You can then navigate the menus with the arrow keys.  To activate a
selected menu item, press &lt;RET&gt;; to cancel menu navigation, press
&lt;ESC&gt;.

   <p>On text-only terminals with no mouse, you can use the menu bar by
typing <kbd>M-`</kbd> or &lt;F10&gt; (these run the command
<code>tmm-menubar</code>).  This lets you select a menu item with the
keyboard.  A provisional choice appears in the echo area.  You can use
the up and down arrow keys to move through the menu to different
items, and then you can type &lt;RET&gt; to select the item.

   <p>Each menu item also has an assigned letter or digit which designates
that item; it is usually the initial of some word in the item's name. 
This letter or digit is separated from the item name by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You
can type the item's letter or digit to select the item.
