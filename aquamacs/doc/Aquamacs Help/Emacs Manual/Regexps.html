<h3 class="section">15.6 Syntax of Regular Expressions</h3>
<a name="index-syntax-of-regexps"></a>
<a name="index-regular-expression"></a>
<a name="index-regexp"></a>

<p>This manual describes regular expression features that users
typically use.  See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Regular-Expressions.html#Regular-Expressions">Regular Expressions</a> in <cite>The Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual</cite>, for additional features used mainly in Lisp
programs.
</p>
<p>Regular expressions have a syntax in which a few characters are
special constructs and the rest are <em>ordinary</em>.  An ordinary
character matches that same character and nothing else.  The special
characters are &lsquo;<samp>$^.*+?[\</samp>&rsquo;.  The character &lsquo;<samp>]</samp>&rsquo; is special if
it ends a character alternative (see later).  The character &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo;
is special inside a character alternative.  Any other character
appearing in a regular expression is ordinary, unless a &lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo;
precedes it.  (When you use regular expressions in a Lisp program,
each &lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo; must be doubled, see the example near the end of this
section.)
</p>
<p>For example, &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; is not a special character, so it is ordinary, and
therefore &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; is a regular expression that matches the string
&lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; and no other string.  (It does <em>not</em> match the string
&lsquo;<samp>ff</samp>&rsquo;.)  Likewise, &lsquo;<samp>o</samp>&rsquo; is a regular expression that matches
only &lsquo;<samp>o</samp>&rsquo;.  (When case distinctions are being ignored, these regexps
also match &lsquo;<samp>F</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>O</samp>&rsquo;, but we consider this a generalization
of &ldquo;the same string&rdquo;, rather than an exception.)
</p>
<p>Any two regular expressions <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> can be concatenated.
The result is a regular expression which matches a string if <var>a</var>
matches some amount of the beginning of that string and <var>b</var>
matches the rest of the string.  For example, concatenating the
regular expressions &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>o</samp>&rsquo; gives the regular expression
&lsquo;<samp>fo</samp>&rsquo;, which matches only the string &lsquo;<samp>fo</samp>&rsquo;.  Still trivial.
To do something nontrivial, you need to use one of the special
characters.  Here is a list of them.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><kbd>.</kbd> <span class="roman">(Period)</span></dt>
<dd><p>is a special character that matches any single character except a
newline.  For example, the regular expressions &lsquo;<samp>a.b</samp>&rsquo; matches any
three-character string that begins with &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo; and ends with
&lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>*</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>is not a construct by itself; it is a postfix operator that means to
match the preceding regular expression repetitively any number of
times, as many times as possible.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp>o*</samp>&rsquo; matches any number
of &lsquo;<samp>o</samp>&rsquo;s, including no &lsquo;<samp>o</samp>&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; always applies to the <em>smallest</em> possible preceding
expression.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp>fo*</samp>&rsquo; has a repeating &lsquo;<samp>o</samp>&rsquo;, not a repeating
&lsquo;<samp>fo</samp>&rsquo;.  It matches &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>fo</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo;, and so on.
</p>
<p>The matcher processes a &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; construct by matching, immediately,
as many repetitions as can be found.  Then it continues with the rest
of the pattern.  If that fails, backtracking occurs, discarding some
of the matches of the &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo;-modified construct in case that makes
it possible to match the rest of the pattern.  For example, in matching
&lsquo;<samp>ca*ar</samp>&rsquo; against the string &lsquo;<samp>caaar</samp>&rsquo;, the &lsquo;<samp>a*</samp>&rsquo; first
tries to match all three &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;s; but the rest of the pattern is
&lsquo;<samp>ar</samp>&rsquo; and there is only &lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo; left to match, so this try fails.
The next alternative is for &lsquo;<samp>a*</samp>&rsquo; to match only two &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;s.
With this choice, the rest of the regexp matches successfully.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>+</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>is a postfix operator, similar to &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; except that it must match
the preceding expression at least once.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp>ca+r</samp>&rsquo; matches the
strings &lsquo;<samp>car</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>caaaar</samp>&rsquo; but not the string &lsquo;<samp>cr</samp>&rsquo;,
whereas &lsquo;<samp>ca*r</samp>&rsquo; matches all three strings.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>?</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>is a postfix operator, similar to &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; except that it can match
the preceding expression either once or not at all.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp>ca?r</samp>&rsquo;
matches &lsquo;<samp>car</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>cr</samp>&rsquo;, and nothing else.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>*?</kbd>, <kbd>+?</kbd>, <kbd>??</kbd></dt>
<dd><a name="index-non_002dgreedy-regexp-matching"></a>
<p>are non-<em>greedy</em> variants of the operators above.  The normal
operators &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>?</samp>&rsquo; match as much as they can, as
long as the overall regexp can still match.  With a following
&lsquo;<samp>?</samp>&rsquo;, they will match as little as possible.
</p>
<p>Thus, both &lsquo;<samp>ab*</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>ab*?</samp>&rsquo; can match the string &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;
and the string &lsquo;<samp>abbbb</samp>&rsquo;; but if you try to match them both against
the text &lsquo;<samp>abbb</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>ab*</samp>&rsquo; will match it all (the longest valid
match), while &lsquo;<samp>ab*?</samp>&rsquo;  will match just &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo; (the shortest
valid match).
</p>
<p>Non-greedy operators match the shortest possible string starting at a
given starting point; in a forward search, though, the earliest
possible starting point for match is always the one chosen.  Thus, if
you search for &lsquo;<samp>a.*?$</samp>&rsquo; against the text &lsquo;<samp>abbab</samp>&rsquo; followed by
a newline, it matches the whole string.  Since it <em>can</em> match
starting at the first &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, it does.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>\{<var>n</var>\}</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>is a postfix operator specifying <var>n</var> repetitions&mdash;that is, the
preceding regular expression must match exactly <var>n</var> times in a
row.  For example, &lsquo;<samp>x\{4\}</samp>&rsquo; matches the string &lsquo;<samp>xxxx</samp>&rsquo; and
nothing else.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>\{<var>n</var>,<var>m</var>\}</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>is a postfix operator specifying between <var>n</var> and <var>m</var>
repetitions&mdash;that is, the preceding regular expression must match at
least <var>n</var> times, but no more than <var>m</var> times.  If <var>m</var> is
omitted, then there is no upper limit, but the preceding regular
expression must match at least <var>n</var> times.<br> &lsquo;<samp>\{0,1\}</samp>&rsquo; is
equivalent to &lsquo;<samp>?</samp>&rsquo;. <br> &lsquo;<samp>\{0,\}</samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo;. <br> &lsquo;<samp>\{1,\}</samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>[ &hellip; ]</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>is a <em>character set</em>, beginning with &lsquo;<samp>[</samp>&rsquo; and terminated by
&lsquo;<samp>]</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>In the simplest case, the characters between the two brackets are what
this set can match.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp>[ad]</samp>&rsquo; matches either one &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo; or
one &lsquo;<samp>d</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>[ad]*</samp>&rsquo; matches any string composed of just
&lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;s and &lsquo;<samp>d</samp>&rsquo;s (including the empty string).  It follows that
&lsquo;<samp>c[ad]*r</samp>&rsquo; matches &lsquo;<samp>cr</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>car</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>cdr</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>caddaar</samp>&rsquo;, etc.
</p>
<p>You can also include character ranges in a character set, by writing the
starting and ending characters with a &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo; between them.  Thus,
&lsquo;<samp>[a-z]</samp>&rsquo; matches any lower-case <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letter.  Ranges may be
intermixed freely with individual characters, as in &lsquo;<samp>[a-z$%.]</samp>&rsquo;,
which matches any lower-case <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letter or &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>%</samp>&rsquo; or
period.
</p>
<p>You can also include certain special <em>character classes</em> in a
character set.  A &lsquo;<samp>[:</samp>&rsquo; and balancing &lsquo;<samp>:]</samp>&rsquo; enclose a
character class inside a character alternative.  For instance,
&lsquo;<samp>[[:alnum:]]</samp>&rsquo; matches any letter or digit.  See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Char-Classes.html#Char-Classes">Char Classes</a> in <cite>The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>, for a list of character
classes.
</p>
<p>To include a &lsquo;<samp>]</samp>&rsquo; in a character set, you must make it the first
character.  For example, &lsquo;<samp>[]a]</samp>&rsquo; matches &lsquo;<samp>]</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;.  To
include a &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo;, write &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo; as the first or last character of the
set, or put it after a range.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp>[]-]</samp>&rsquo; matches both &lsquo;<samp>]</samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>To include &lsquo;<samp>^</samp>&rsquo; in a set, put it anywhere but at the beginning of
the set.  (At the beginning, it complements the set&mdash;see below.)
</p>
<p>When you use a range in case-insensitive search, you should write both
ends of the range in upper case, or both in lower case, or both should
be non-letters.  The behavior of a mixed-case range such as &lsquo;<samp>A-z</samp>&rsquo;
is somewhat ill-defined, and it may change in future Emacs versions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>[^ &hellip; ]</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>&lsquo;<samp>[^</samp>&rsquo; begins a <em>complemented character set</em>, which matches any
character except the ones specified.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp>[^a-z0-9A-Z]</samp>&rsquo; matches
all characters <em>except</em> <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letters and digits.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp>^</samp>&rsquo; is not special in a character set unless it is the first
character.  The character following the &lsquo;<samp>^</samp>&rsquo; is treated as if it
were first (in other words, &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>]</samp>&rsquo; are not special there).
</p>
<p>A complemented character set can match a newline, unless newline is
mentioned as one of the characters not to match.  This is in contrast to
the handling of regexps in programs such as <code>grep</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>^</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>is a special character that matches the empty string, but only at the
beginning of a line in the text being matched.  Otherwise it fails to
match anything.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp>^foo</samp>&rsquo; matches a &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo; that occurs at
the beginning of a line.
</p>
<p>For historical compatibility reasons, &lsquo;<samp>^</samp>&rsquo; can be used with this
meaning only at the beginning of the regular expression, or after
&lsquo;<samp>\(</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>\|</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>$</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>is similar to &lsquo;<samp>^</samp>&rsquo; but matches only at the end of a line.  Thus,
&lsquo;<samp>x+$</samp>&rsquo; matches a string of one &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; or more at the end of a line.
</p>
<p>For historical compatibility reasons, &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; can be used with this
meaning only at the end of the regular expression, or before &lsquo;<samp>\)</samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp>\|</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>\</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>has two functions: it quotes the special characters (including
&lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo;), and it introduces additional special constructs.
</p>
<p>Because &lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo; quotes special characters, &lsquo;<samp>\$</samp>&rsquo; is a regular
expression that matches only &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>\[</samp>&rsquo; is a regular
expression that matches only &lsquo;<samp>[</samp>&rsquo;, and so on.
</p>
<p>See the following section for the special constructs that begin
with &lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo;.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Note: for historical compatibility, special characters are treated as
ordinary ones if they are in contexts where their special meanings make no
sense.  For example, &lsquo;<samp>*foo</samp>&rsquo; treats &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; as ordinary since there is
no preceding expression on which the &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; can act.  It is poor practice
to depend on this behavior; it is better to quote the special character anyway,
regardless of where it appears.
</p>
<p>As a &lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo; is not special inside a character alternative, it can
never remove the special meaning of &lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>]</samp>&rsquo;.  So you
should not quote these characters when they have no special meaning
either.  This would not clarify anything, since backslashes can
legitimately precede these characters where they <em>have</em> special
meaning, as in &lsquo;<samp>[^\]</samp>&rsquo; (<code>&quot;[^\\]&quot;</code> for Lisp string syntax),
which matches any single character except a backslash.
