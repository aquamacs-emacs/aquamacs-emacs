<h3 class="section">10.3 Help by Command or Variable Name</h3>

<p><a name="index-C_002dh-f-225"></a><a name="index-describe_002dfunction-226"></a>  <kbd>C-h f </kbd><var>function</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>)
displays the documentation of Lisp function <var>function</var>, in a
window.  Since commands are Lisp functions, you can use this method to
view the documentation of any command whose name you know.  For
example,

<pre class="example">     C-h f auto-fill-mode &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">displays the documentation of <code>auto-fill-mode</code>.  This is the only
way to get the documentation of a command that is not bound to any key
(one which you would normally run using <kbd>M-x</kbd>).

   <p><kbd>C-h f</kbd> is also useful for Lisp functions that you use in a Lisp
program.  For example, if you have just written the expression
<code>(make-vector len)</code> and want to check that you are using
<code>make-vector</code> properly, type <kbd>C-h f make-vector &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
Because <kbd>C-h f</kbd> allows all function names, not just command names,
you may find that some of your favorite completion abbreviations that
work in <kbd>M-x</kbd> don't work in <kbd>C-h f</kbd>.  An abbreviation that is
unique among command names may not be unique among all function names.

   <p>If you type <kbd>C-h f &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, it describes the function called
by the innermost Lisp expression in the buffer around point,
<em>provided</em> that function name is a valid, defined Lisp function. 
(That name appears as the default while you enter the argument.)  For
example, if point is located following the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(make-vector
(car x)</span></samp>&rsquo;, the innermost list containing point is the one that starts
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(make-vector</span></samp>&rsquo;, so <kbd>C-h f &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> will describe the
function <code>make-vector</code>.

   <p><kbd>C-h f</kbd> is also useful just to verify that you spelled a
function name correctly.  If the minibuffer prompt for <kbd>C-h f</kbd>
shows the function name from the buffer as the default, it means that
name is defined as a Lisp function.  Type <kbd>C-g</kbd> to cancel the
<kbd>C-h f</kbd> command if you don't really want to view the
documentation.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-v-227"></a><a name="index-describe_002dvariable-228"></a>  <kbd>C-h v</kbd> (<code>describe-variable</code>) is like <kbd>C-h f</kbd> but
describes Lisp variables instead of Lisp functions.  Its default is
the Lisp symbol around or before point, if that is the name of a
defined Lisp variable.  See <a href="Variables.html#Variables">Variables</a>.

   <p>Help buffers that describe Emacs variables and functions normally
have hyperlinks to the corresponding source definition, if you have
the source files installed.  (See <a href="Hyperlinking.html#Hyperlinking">Hyperlinking</a>.)  If you know Lisp
(or C), this provides the ultimate documentation.  If you don't know
Lisp, you should learn it.  (The Introduction to Emacs Lisp
Programming, available from the FSF through fsf.org, is a good way to
get started.)  If Emacs feels you are just <em>using</em> it, treating
it as an object program, its feelings may be hurt.  For real intimacy,
read the Emacs source code.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-F-229"></a><a name="index-Info_002dgoto_002demacs_002dcommand_002dnode-230"></a>  To find a command's documentation in a manual, use <kbd>C-h F</kbd>
(<code>Info-goto-emacs-command-node</code>).  This knows about various
manuals, not just the Emacs manual, and finds the right one.
