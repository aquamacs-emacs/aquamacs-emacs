<h3 class="section">37.3 Deleting Files with Dired</h3>

<p><a name="index-flagging-files-_0028in-Dired_0029-2955"></a><a name="index-deleting-files-_0028in-Dired_0029-2956"></a>
  One of the most frequent uses of Dired is to first <dfn>flag</dfn> files for
deletion, then delete the files that were flagged.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Flag this file for deletion. 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Remove deletion flag on this line. 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dd>Move point to previous line and remove the deletion flag on that line. 
<br><dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd>Delete the files that are flagged for deletion. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-d-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-2957"></a><a name="index-dired_002dflag_002dfile_002ddeletion-2958"></a>  You can flag a file for deletion by moving to the line describing
the file and typing <kbd>d</kbd> (<code>dired-flag-file-deletion</code>).  The
deletion flag is visible as a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of the line. 
This command moves point to the next line, so that repeated <kbd>d</kbd>
commands flag successive files.  A numeric argument serves as a repeat
count.

   <p><a name="index-u-_0040r_007b_0028Dired-deletion_0029_007d-2959"></a><a name="index-DEL-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-2960"></a>  The reason for flagging files for deletion, rather than deleting
files immediately, is to reduce the danger of deleting a file
accidentally.  Until you direct Dired to delete the flagged files, you
can remove deletion flags using the commands <kbd>u</kbd> and &lt;DEL&gt;. 
<kbd>u</kbd> (<code>dired-unmark</code>) works just like <kbd>d</kbd>, but removes
flags rather than making flags.  &lt;DEL&gt;
(<code>dired-unmark-backward</code>) moves upward, removing flags; it is
like <kbd>u</kbd> with argument &minus;1.

   <p><a name="index-x-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-2961"></a><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002dflagged_002ddelete-2962"></a>  To delete the flagged files, type <kbd>x</kbd>
(<code>dired-do-flagged-delete</code>).  This command first displays a list
of all the file names flagged for deletion, and requests confirmation
with <kbd>yes</kbd>.  If you confirm, Dired deletes the flagged files, then
deletes their lines from the text of the Dired buffer.  The Dired
buffer, with somewhat fewer lines, remains selected.

   <p>If you answer <kbd>no</kbd> or quit with <kbd>C-g</kbd> when asked to confirm, you
return immediately to Dired, with the deletion flags still present in
the buffer, and no files actually deleted.

   <p><a name="index-recursive-deletion-2963"></a><a name="index-dired_002drecursive_002ddeletes-2964"></a>  You can delete empty directories just like other files, but normally
Dired cannot delete directories that are nonempty.  If the variable
<code>dired-recursive-deletes</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then Dired can
delete nonempty directories including all their contents.  That can
be somewhat risky.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dby_002dmoving_002dto_002dtrash-2965"></a>  On some systems, there is a facility called the &ldquo;Trash&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Recycle Bin&rdquo;, but Emacs does <em>not</em> use it by default.  Thus,
when you delete a file in Dired, it is gone forever.  However, you can
tell Emacs to use the Trash for file deletion, by changing the
variable <code>delete-by-moving-to-trash</code> to <code>t</code>.  See <a href="Misc-File-Ops.html#Misc-File-Ops">Misc File Ops</a>, for more information about the Trash.
