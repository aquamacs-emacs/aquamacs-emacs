<h3 class="section">26.6 Coding Systems</h3>

<p><a name="index-coding-systems-1400"></a>
  Users of various languages have established many more-or-less standard
coding systems for representing them.  Emacs does not use these coding
systems internally; instead, it converts from various coding systems to
its own system when reading data, and converts the internal coding
system to other coding systems when writing data.  Conversion is
possible in reading or writing files, in sending or receiving from the
terminal, and in exchanging data with subprocesses.

   <p>Emacs assigns a name to each coding system.  Most coding systems are
used for one language, and the name of the coding system starts with
the language name.  Some coding systems are used for several
languages; their names usually start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">iso</span></samp>&rsquo;.  There are also
special coding systems, such as <code>no-conversion</code>, <code>raw-text</code>,
and <code>emacs-internal</code>.

   <p><a name="index-international-files-from-DOS_002fWindows-systems-1401"></a>  A special class of coding systems, collectively known as
<dfn>codepages</dfn>, is designed to support text encoded by MS-Windows and
MS-DOS software.  The names of these coding systems are
<code>cp</code><var>nnnn</var>, where <var>nnnn</var> is a 3- or 4-digit number of the
codepage.  You can use these encodings just like any other coding
system; for example, to visit a file encoded in codepage 850, type
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c cp850 &lt;RET&gt; C-x C-f </kbd><var>filename</var><kbd>
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>In addition to converting various representations of non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters, a coding system can perform end-of-line conversion.  Emacs
handles three different conventions for how to separate lines in a file:
newline, carriage-return linefeed, and just carriage-return.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-h C </kbd><var>coding</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Describe coding system <var>coding</var>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-h C &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Describe the coding systems currently in use.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x list-coding-systems</kbd><dd>Display a list of all the supported coding systems. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-C-1402"></a><a name="index-describe_002dcoding_002dsystem-1403"></a>  The command <kbd>C-h C</kbd> (<code>describe-coding-system</code>) displays
information about particular coding systems, including the end-of-line
conversion specified by those coding systems.  You can specify a coding
system name as the argument; alternatively, with an empty argument, it
describes the coding systems currently selected for various purposes,
both in the current buffer and as the defaults, and the priority list
for recognizing coding systems (see <a href="Recognize-Coding.html#Recognize-Coding">Recognize Coding</a>).

   <p><a name="index-list_002dcoding_002dsystems-1404"></a>  To display a list of all the supported coding systems, type <kbd>M-x
list-coding-systems</kbd>.  The list gives information about each coding
system, including the letter that stands for it in the mode line
(see <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).

   <p><a name="index-end_002dof_002dline-conversion-1405"></a><a name="index-line-endings-1406"></a><a name="index-MS_002dDOS-end_002dof_002dline-conversion-1407"></a><a name="index-Macintosh-end_002dof_002dline-conversion-1408"></a>  Each of the coding systems that appear in this list&mdash;except for
<code>no-conversion</code>, which means no conversion of any kind&mdash;specifies
how and whether to convert printing characters, but leaves the choice of
end-of-line conversion to be decided based on the contents of each file. 
For example, if the file appears to use the sequence carriage-return
linefeed to separate lines, DOS end-of-line conversion will be used.

   <p>Each of the listed coding systems has three variants which specify
exactly what to do for end-of-line conversion:

     <dl>
<dt><code>...-unix</code><dd>Don't do any end-of-line conversion; assume the file uses
newline to separate lines.  (This is the convention normally used
on Unix and GNU systems.)

     <br><dt><code>...-dos</code><dd>Assume the file uses carriage-return linefeed to separate lines, and do
the appropriate conversion.  (This is the convention normally used on
Microsoft systems.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>)

     <br><dt><code>...-mac</code><dd>Assume the file uses carriage-return to separate lines, and do the
appropriate conversion.  (This is the convention normally used on the
Macintosh system.) 
</dl>

   <p>These variant coding systems are omitted from the
<code>list-coding-systems</code> display for brevity, since they are entirely
predictable.  For example, the coding system <code>iso-latin-1</code> has
variants <code>iso-latin-1-unix</code>, <code>iso-latin-1-dos</code> and
<code>iso-latin-1-mac</code>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bundecided_007d_002c-coding-system-1409"></a>  The coding systems <code>unix</code>, <code>dos</code>, and <code>mac</code> are
aliases for <code>undecided-unix</code>, <code>undecided-dos</code>, and
<code>undecided-mac</code>, respectively.  These coding systems specify only
the end-of-line conversion, and leave the character code conversion to
be deduced from the text itself.

   <p>The coding system <code>raw-text</code> is good for a file which is mainly
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> text, but may contain byte values above 127 which are
not meant to encode non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters.  With
<code>raw-text</code>, Emacs copies those byte values unchanged, and sets
<code>enable-multibyte-characters</code> to <code>nil</code> in the current buffer
so that they will be interpreted properly.  <code>raw-text</code> handles
end-of-line conversion in the usual way, based on the data
encountered, and has the usual three variants to specify the kind of
end-of-line conversion to use.

   <p>In contrast, the coding system <code>no-conversion</code> specifies no
character code conversion at all&mdash;none for non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> byte values and
none for end of line.  This is useful for reading or writing binary
files, tar files, and other files that must be examined verbatim.  It,
too, sets <code>enable-multibyte-characters</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>The easiest way to edit a file with no conversion of any kind is with
the <kbd>M-x find-file-literally</kbd> command.  This uses
<code>no-conversion</code>, and also suppresses other Emacs features that
might convert the file contents before you see them.  See <a href="Visiting.html#Visiting">Visiting</a>.

   <p>The coding system <code>emacs-internal</code> (or <code>utf-8-emacs</code>,
which is equivalent) means that the file contains non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters stored with the internal Emacs encoding.  This coding
system handles end-of-line conversion based on the data encountered,
and has the usual three variants to specify the kind of end-of-line
conversion.
