<h4 class="subsection">32.4.5 Exiting Emerge</h4>

<p>The <kbd>q</kbd> command (<code>emerge-quit</code>) finishes the merge, storing
the results into the output file if you specified one.  It restores the
A and B buffers to their proper contents, or kills them if they were
created by Emerge and you haven't changed them.  It also disables the
Emerge commands in the merge buffer, since executing them later could
damage the contents of the various buffers.

   <p><kbd>C-]</kbd> aborts the merge.  This means exiting without writing the
output file.  If you didn't specify an output file, then there is no
real difference between aborting and finishing the merge.

   <p>If the Emerge command was called from another Lisp program, then its
return value is <code>t</code> for successful completion, or <code>nil</code> if you
abort.
