</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-0-1141"></a><a name="index-delete_002dwindow-1142"></a>  To delete a window, type <kbd>C-x 0</kbd> (<code>delete-window</code>).  (That is
a zero.)  The space occupied by the deleted window is given to an
adjacent window (but not the minibuffer window, even if that is active
at the time).  Once a window is deleted, its attributes are forgotten;
only restoring a window configuration can bring it back.  Deleting the
window has no effect on the buffer it used to display; the buffer
continues to exist, and you can select it in any window with <kbd>C-x
b</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dbuffer_002dand_002dwindow-1143"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-4-0-1144"></a>  <kbd>C-x 4 0</kbd> (<code>kill-buffer-and-window</code>) is a stronger command
than <kbd>C-x 0</kbd>; it kills the current buffer and then deletes the
selected window.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-1-1145"></a><a name="index-delete_002dother_002dwindows-1146"></a>  <kbd>C-x 1</kbd> (<code>delete-other-windows</code>) is more powerful in a
different way; it deletes all the windows except the selected one (and
the minibuffer); the selected window expands to use the whole frame
except for the echo area.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_005e-1147"></a><a name="index-enlarge_002dwindow-1148"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-_0040_007d-1149"></a><a name="index-enlarge_002dwindow_002dhorizontally-1150"></a><a name="index-window_002dmin_002dheight-1151"></a><a name="index-window_002dmin_002dwidth-1152"></a>  To readjust the division of space among vertically adjacent windows,
use <kbd>C-x ^</kbd> (<code>enlarge-window</code>).  It makes the currently
selected window one line bigger, or as many lines as is specified
with a numeric argument.  With a negative argument, it makes the
selected window smaller.  <kbd>C-x }</kbd>
(<code>enlarge-window-horizontally</code>) makes the selected window wider by
the specified number of columns.  <kbd>C-x {</kbd>
(<code>shrink-window-horizontally</code>) makes the selected window narrower
by the specified number of columns.

   <p>When you make a window bigger, the space comes from its peers.  If
this makes any window too small, it is deleted and its space is given
to an adjacent window.  The minimum size is specified by the variables
<code>window-min-height</code> and <code>window-min-width</code>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002d-1153"></a><a name="index-shrink_002dwindow_002dif_002dlarger_002dthan_002dbuffer-1154"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x -</kbd> (<code>shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer</code>)
reduces the height of the selected window, if it is taller than
necessary to show the whole text of the buffer it is displaying.  It
gives the extra lines to other windows in the frame.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_002b-1155"></a><a name="index-balance_002dwindows-1156"></a>  You can also use <kbd>C-x +</kbd> (<code>balance-windows</code>) to even out the
heights of all the windows in the selected frame.

   <p>Mouse clicks on the mode line provide another way to change window
heights and to delete windows.  See <a href="Mode-Line-Mouse.html#Mode-Line-Mouse">Mode Line Mouse</a>.
