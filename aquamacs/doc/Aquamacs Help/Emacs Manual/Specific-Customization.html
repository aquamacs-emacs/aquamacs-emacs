<h4 class="subsection">57.2.6 Customizing Specific Items</h4>

<p>Instead of finding the setting you want to change by navigating the
structure of groups, here are other ways to specify the settings that
you want to customize.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x customize-option &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>option</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Set up a customization buffer with just one user option variable,
<var>option</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-face &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>face</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Set up a customization buffer with just one face, <var>face</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-group &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>group</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Set up a customization buffer with just one group, <var>group</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-apropos &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Set up a customization buffer with all the settings and groups that
match <var>regexp</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-changed &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>version</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Set up a customization buffer with all the settings and groups
whose meaning has changed since Emacs version <var>version</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-saved</kbd><dd>Set up a customization buffer containing all settings that you
have saved with customization buffers. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-unsaved</kbd><dd>Set up a customization buffer containing all settings that you have
set but not saved. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-customize_002doption-3962"></a>  If you want to alter a particular user option with the customization
buffer, and you know its name, you can use the command <kbd>M-x
customize-option</kbd> and specify the user option (variable) name.  This
sets up the customization buffer with just one user option&mdash;the one
that you asked for.  Editing, setting and saving the value work as
described above, but only for the specified user option.  Minibuffer
completion is handy if you only know part of the name.  However, this
command can only see options that have been loaded in the current
Emacs session.

   <p><a name="index-customize_002dface-3963"></a>  Likewise, you can modify a specific face, chosen by name, using
<kbd>M-x customize-face</kbd>.  By default it operates on the face used
on the character after point.

   <p><a name="index-customize_002dgroup-3964"></a>  You can also set up the customization buffer with a specific group,
using <kbd>M-x customize-group</kbd>.  The immediate contents of the chosen
group, including settings (user options and faces), and other groups,
all appear as well (even if not already loaded).  However, the
subgroups' own contents are not included.

   <p><a name="index-customize_002dapropos-3965"></a>  For a more general way of controlling what to customize, you can use
<kbd>M-x customize-apropos</kbd>.  You specify a regular expression as
argument; then all <em>loaded</em> settings and groups whose names match
this regular expression are set up in the customization buffer.  If
you specify an empty regular expression, this includes <em>all</em>
loaded groups and settings&mdash;which takes a long time to set up.

   <p><a name="index-customize_002dchanged-3966"></a>  When you upgrade to a new Emacs version, you might want to consider
customizing new settings, and settings whose meanings or default
values have changed.  To do this, use <kbd>M-x customize-changed</kbd> and
specify a previous Emacs version number using the minibuffer.  It
creates a customization buffer which shows all the settings and groups
whose definitions have been changed since the specified version,
loading them if necessary.

   <p><a name="index-customize_002dsaved-3967"></a><a name="index-customize_002dunsaved-3968"></a>  If you change settings and then decide the change was a mistake, you
can use two special commands to revisit your previous changes.  Use
<kbd>M-x customize-saved</kbd> to look at the settings that you have saved. 
Use <kbd>M-x customize-unsaved</kbd> to look at the settings that you
have set but not saved.
