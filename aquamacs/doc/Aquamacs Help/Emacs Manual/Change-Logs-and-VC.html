<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.10.1 Change Logs and VC</h5>

<p>If you use RCS or CVS for a program and also maintain a change log
file for it
(see <a href="Change-Log.html#Change-Log">Change Log</a>),
you can generate change log entries automatically from the version
control log entries:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v a</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-v-a-2507"></a><a name="index-vc_002dupdate_002dchange_002dlog-2508"></a>Visit the current directory's change log file and, for registered files
in that directory, create new entries for versions checked in since the
most recent entry in the change log file. 
(<code>vc-update-change-log</code>).

     <p>This command works with RCS or CVS only, not with any of the other
back ends.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-u C-x v a</kbd><dd>As above, but only find entries for the current buffer's file.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-1 C-x v a</kbd><dd>As above, but find entries for all the currently visited files that are
maintained with version control.  This works only with RCS, and it puts
all entries in the log for the default directory, which may not be
appropriate. 
</dl>

   <p>For example, suppose the first line of <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> is dated
1999-04-10, and that the only check-in since then was by Nathaniel
Bowditch to <samp><span class="file">rcs2log</span></samp> on 1999-05-22 with log text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ignore log
messages that start with `#'.</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Then <kbd>C-x v a</kbd> visits
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> and inserts text like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     1999-05-22  Nathaniel Bowditch  &lt;nat@apn.org&gt;
     
             * rcs2log: Ignore log messages that start with `#'.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can then edit the new change log entry further as you wish.

   <p>Some of the new change log entries may duplicate what's already in
ChangeLog.  You will have to remove these duplicates by hand.

   <p>Normally, the log entry for file <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> is displayed as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*
foo: </span><var>text of log entry</var></samp>&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; after <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> is omitted
if the text of the log entry starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span><var>functionname</var><span class="samp">):&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  For example, if the log entry for <samp><span class="file">vc.el</span></samp> is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(vc-do-command): Check call-process status.</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the text in
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     1999-05-06  Nathaniel Bowditch  &lt;nat@apn.org&gt;
     
             * vc.el (vc-do-command): Check call-process status.
</pre>
   <p>When <kbd>C-x v a</kbd> adds several change log entries at once, it groups
related log entries together if they all are checked in by the same
author at nearly the same time.  If the log entries for several such
files all have the same text, it coalesces them into a single entry. 
For example, suppose the most recent check-ins have the following log
entries:

<div align="left">&bull; For <samp><span class="file">vc.texinfo</span></samp>: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Fix expansion typos.</span></samp>&rsquo;
&bull; For <samp><span class="file">vc.el</span></samp>: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Don't call expand-file-name.</span></samp>&rsquo;
&bull; For <samp><span class="file">vc-hooks.el</span></samp>: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Don't call expand-file-name.</span></samp>&rsquo;
</div>

<p class="noindent">They appear like this in <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>:

<pre class="smallexample">     1999-04-01  Nathaniel Bowditch  &lt;nat@apn.org&gt;
     
             * vc.texinfo: Fix expansion typos.
     
             * vc.el, vc-hooks.el: Don't call expand-file-name.
</pre>
   <p>Normally, <kbd>C-x v a</kbd> separates log entries by a blank line, but you
can mark several related log entries to be clumped together (without an
intervening blank line) by starting the text of each related log entry
with a label of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span><var>clumpname</var><span class="samp">}&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  The label
itself is not copied to <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>.  For example, suppose the log
entries are:

<div align="left">&bull; For <samp><span class="file">vc.texinfo</span></samp>: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{expand} Fix expansion typos.</span></samp>&rsquo;
&bull; For <samp><span class="file">vc.el</span></samp>: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{expand} Don't call expand-file-name.</span></samp>&rsquo;
&bull; For <samp><span class="file">vc-hooks.el</span></samp>: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{expand} Don't call expand-file-name.</span></samp>&rsquo;
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then the text in <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     1999-04-01  Nathaniel Bowditch  &lt;nat@apn.org&gt;
     
             * vc.texinfo: Fix expansion typos.
             * vc.el, vc-hooks.el: Don't call expand-file-name.
</pre>
   <p>A log entry whose text begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; is not copied to
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>.  For example, if you merely fix some misspellings in
comments, you can log the change with an entry beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;
to avoid putting such trivia into <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>.
