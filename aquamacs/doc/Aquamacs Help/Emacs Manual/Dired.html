  Dired makes an Emacs buffer containing a listing of a directory, and
optionally some of its subdirectories as well.  You can use the normal
Emacs commands to move around in this buffer, and special Dired
commands to operate on the listed files.

   <p>The Dired buffer is &ldquo;read-only,&rdquo; and inserting text in it is not
allowed.  Ordinary printing characters such as <kbd>d</kbd> and <kbd>x</kbd> are
redefined for special Dired commands.  Some Dired commands <dfn>mark</dfn>
or <dfn>flag</dfn> the <dfn>current file</dfn> (that is, the file on the current
line); other commands operate on the marked files or on the flagged
files.  You first mark certain files in order to operate on all of
them with one command.

   <p>The Dired-X package provides various extra features for Dired mode. 
See <a href="../dired-x/index.html#Top">Dired-X</a>.

   <p>You can also view a list of files in a directory with <kbd>C-x C-d</kbd>
(<code>list-directory</code>).  Unlike Dired, this command does not allow
you to operate on the listed files.  See <a href="Directories.html#Directories">Directories</a>.
