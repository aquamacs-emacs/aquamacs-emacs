<h4 class="subsection">22.3.1 Commands for Saving Files</h4>

<p>These are the commands that relate to saving and writing files.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x C-s</kbd><dd>Save the current buffer in its visited file on disk (<code>save-buffer</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x s</kbd><dd>Save any or all buffers in their visited files (<code>save-some-buffers</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-~</kbd><dd>Forget that the current buffer has been changed (<code>not-modified</code>). 
With prefix argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>), mark the current buffer as changed. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-w</kbd><dd>Save the current buffer with a specified file name (<code>write-file</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x set-visited-file-name</kbd><dd>Change the file name under which the current buffer will be saved. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002ds-841"></a><a name="index-save_002dbuffer-842"></a>  When you wish to save the file and make your changes permanent, type
<kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> (<code>save-buffer</code>).  After saving is finished, <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>
displays a message like this:

<pre class="example">     Wrote /u/rms/gnu/gnu.tasks
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the selected buffer is not modified (no changes have been made in it
since the buffer was created or last saved), saving is not really done,
because it would have no effect.  Instead, <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> displays a message
like this in the echo area:

<pre class="example">     (No changes need to be saved)
</pre>
   <p>With a prefix argument, <kbd>C-u C-x C-s</kbd>, Emacs also marks the buffer
to be backed up when the next save is done.  See <a href="Backup.html#Backup">Backup</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-s-843"></a><a name="index-save_002dsome_002dbuffers-844"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x s</kbd> (<code>save-some-buffers</code>) offers to save any
or all modified buffers.  It asks you what to do with each buffer.  The
possible responses are analogous to those of <code>query-replace</code>:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>y</kbd><dd>Save this buffer and ask about the rest of the buffers. 
<br><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>Don't save this buffer, but ask about the rest of the buffers. 
<br><dt><kbd>!</kbd><dd>Save this buffer and all the rest with no more questions. 
<!-- following generates acceptable underfull hbox -->
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Terminate <code>save-some-buffers</code> without any more saving. 
<br><dt><kbd>.</kbd><dd>Save this buffer, then exit <code>save-some-buffers</code> without even asking
about other buffers. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-r</kbd><dd>View the buffer that you are currently being asked about.  When you exit
View mode, you get back to <code>save-some-buffers</code>, which asks the
question again. 
<br><dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Diff the buffer against its corresponding file, so you can see what
changes you would be saving.  This calls the command
<code>diff-buffer-with-file</code> (see <a href="Comparing-Files.html#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-h</kbd><dd>Display a help message about these options. 
</dl>

   <p><kbd>C-x C-c</kbd>, the key sequence to exit Emacs, invokes
<code>save-some-buffers</code> and therefore asks the same questions.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_007e-845"></a><a name="index-not_002dmodified-846"></a>  If you have changed a buffer but do not wish to save the changes,
you should take some action to prevent it.  Otherwise, each time you
use <kbd>C-x s</kbd> or <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd>, you are liable to save this buffer
by mistake.  One thing you can do is type <kbd>M-~</kbd>
(<code>not-modified</code>), which clears out the indication that the buffer
is modified.  If you do this, none of the save commands will believe
that the buffer needs to be saved.  (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; is often used as a
mathematical symbol for `not'; thus <kbd>M-~</kbd> is `not', metafied.) 
Alternatively, you can cancel all the changes made since the file was
visited or saved, by reading the text from the file again.  This is
called <dfn>reverting</dfn>.  See <a href="Reverting.html#Reverting">Reverting</a>.  (You could also undo all
the changes by repeating the undo command <kbd>C-x u</kbd> until you have
undone all the changes; but reverting is easier.)

   <p><a name="index-set_002dvisited_002dfile_002dname-847"></a>  <kbd>M-x set-visited-file-name</kbd> alters the name of the file that the
current buffer is visiting.  It reads the new file name using the
minibuffer.  Then it marks the buffer as visiting that file name, and
changes the buffer name correspondingly.  <code>set-visited-file-name</code>
does not save the buffer in the newly visited file; it just alters the
records inside Emacs in case you do save later.  It also marks the
buffer as &ldquo;modified&rdquo; so that <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> in that buffer
<em>will</em> save.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dw-848"></a><a name="index-write_002dfile-849"></a>  If you wish to mark the buffer as visiting a different file and save
it right away, use <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> (<code>write-file</code>).  This is
equivalent to <code>set-visited-file-name</code> followed by <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>,
except that <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> asks for confirmation if the file exists. 
<kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> used on a buffer that is not visiting a file has the
same effect as <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd>; that is, it reads a file name, marks the
buffer as visiting that file, and saves it there.  The default file
name in a buffer that is not visiting a file is made by combining the
buffer name with the buffer's default directory (see <a href="File-Names.html#File-Names">File Names</a>).

   <p>If the new file name implies a major mode, then <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> switches
to that major mode, in most cases.  The command
<code>set-visited-file-name</code> also does this.  See <a href="Choosing-Modes.html#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>.

   <p>If Emacs is about to save a file and sees that the date of the latest
version on disk does not match what Emacs last read or wrote, Emacs
notifies you of this fact, because it probably indicates a problem caused
by simultaneous editing and requires your immediate attention.
