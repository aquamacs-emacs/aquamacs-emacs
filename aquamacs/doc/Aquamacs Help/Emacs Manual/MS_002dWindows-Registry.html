<h4 class="appendixsubsec">C.5.3 The MS-Windows System Registry</h4>

<p><a name="index-addpm_002c-MS_002dWindows-installation-program-4194"></a><a name="index-registry_002c-setting-environment-variables-and-resources-on-MS_002dWindows-4195"></a>
Under MS-Windows, the installation program <samp><span class="command">addpm.exe</span></samp> adds
values for <samp><span class="env">emacs_dir</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">EMACSLOADPATH</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">EMACSDATA</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="env">EMACSPATH</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">EMACSDOC</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">TERM</span></samp> to the
<samp><span class="file">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span></samp> section of the system registry, under
<samp><span class="file">/Software/GNU/Emacs</span></samp>.  It does this because there is no standard
place to set environment variables across different versions of
Windows.  Running <samp><span class="command">addpm.exe</span></samp> is no longer strictly necessary
in recent versions of Emacs, but if you are upgrading from an older
version, running <samp><span class="command">addpm.exe</span></samp> ensures that you do not have
older registry entries from a previous installation, which may not be
compatible with the latest version of Emacs.

   <p>When Emacs starts, as well as checking the environment, it also checks
the System Registry for those variables and for <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="env">PRELOAD_WINSOCK</span></samp>.

   <p>To determine the value of those variables, Emacs goes through the
following procedure.  First, the environment is checked.  If the
variable is not found there, Emacs looks for registry keys by that
name under <samp><span class="file">/Software/GNU/Emacs</span></samp>; first in the
<samp><span class="file">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span></samp> section of the registry, and if not found
there, in the <samp><span class="file">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span></samp> section.  Finally, if Emacs
still cannot determine the values, compiled-in defaults are used.

   <p>In addition to the environment variables above, you can also add many
of the settings which on X belong in the <samp><span class="file">.Xdefaults</span></samp> file
(see <a href="X-Resources.html#X-Resources">X Resources</a>) to the <samp><span class="file">/Software/GNU/Emacs</span></samp> registry key. 
Settings you add to the <samp><span class="file">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span></samp> section will affect
all users of the machine.  Settings you add to the
<samp><span class="file">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span></samp> section will only affect you, and will
override machine wide settings.
