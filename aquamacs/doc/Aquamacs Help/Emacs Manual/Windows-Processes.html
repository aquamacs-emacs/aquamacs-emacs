<h3 class="section">G.7 Subprocesses on Windows 9X/ME and Windows NT/2K/XP</h3>

<p><a name="index-subprocesses-on-MS_002dWindows-4373"></a>
<a name="index-DOS-applications_002c-running-from-Emacs-4374"></a>  Emacs compiled as a native Windows application (as opposed to the DOS
version) includes full support for asynchronous subprocesses. 
In the Windows version, synchronous and asynchronous subprocesses work
fine on both
Windows 9X/ME and Windows NT/2K/XP as long as you run only 32-bit Windows
applications.  However, when you run a DOS application in a subprocess,
you may encounter problems or be unable to run the application at all;
and if you run two DOS applications at the same time in two
subprocesses, you may have to reboot your system.

   <p>Since the standard command interpreter (and most command line utilities)
on Windows 9X are DOS applications, these problems are significant when
using that system.  But there's nothing we can do about them; only
Microsoft can fix them.

   <p>If you run just one DOS application subprocess, the subprocess should
work as expected as long as it is &ldquo;well-behaved&rdquo; and does not perform
direct screen access or other unusual actions.  If you have a CPU
monitor application, your machine will appear to be 100% busy even when
the DOS application is idle, but this is only an artifact of the way CPU
monitors measure processor load.

   <p>You must terminate the DOS application before you start any other DOS
application in a different subprocess.  Emacs is unable to interrupt or
terminate a DOS subprocess.  The only way you can terminate such a
subprocess is by giving it a command that tells its program to exit.

   <p>If you attempt to run two DOS applications at the same time in separate
subprocesses, the second one that is started will be suspended until the
first one finishes, even if either or both of them are asynchronous.

   <p><a name="index-kill-DOS-application-4375"></a>If you can go to the first subprocess, and tell it to exit, the second
subprocess should continue normally.  However, if the second subprocess
is synchronous, Emacs itself will be hung until the first subprocess
finishes.  If it will not finish without user input, then you have no
choice but to reboot if you are running on Windows 9X.  If you are
running on Windows NT/2K/XP, you can use a process viewer application to kill
the appropriate instance of NTVDM instead (this will terminate both DOS
subprocesses).

   <p>If you have to reboot Windows 9X in this situation, do not use the
<code>Shutdown</code> command on the <code>Start</code> menu; that usually hangs the
system.  Instead, type <kbd>CTL-ALT-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> and then choose
<code>Shutdown</code>.  That usually works, although it may take a few minutes
to do its job.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dquote_002dprocess_002dargs-4376"></a>  The variable <code>w32-quote-process-args</code> controls how Emacs quotes
the process arguments.  Non-<code>nil</code> means quote with the <code>"</code>
character.  If the value is a character, use that character to escape
any quote characters that appear; otherwise chose a suitable escape
character based on the type of the program.

   <p><a name="index-w32_002dshell_002dexecute-4377"></a>  The function <code>w32-shell-execute</code> can be useful for writing
customized commands that run MS-Windows applications registered to
handle a certain standard Windows operation for a specific type of
document or file.  This function is a wrapper around the Windows
<code>ShellExecute</code> API.  See the MS-Windows API documentation for
more details.
