<h4 class="subsection">19.1.3 Errors in Incremental Search</h4>

<p>If your string is not found at all, the echo area says &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Failing
I-Search</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The cursor is after the place where Emacs found as much of
your string as it could.  Thus, if you search for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
there is no &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>&rsquo;, you might see the cursor after the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>&rsquo;
in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOL</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In the echo area, the part of the search string that
failed to match is highlighted using the customizable face
<code>isearch-fail</code>.

   <p>At this point, there are several things you can do.  If your string
was mistyped, you can use &lt;DEL&gt; to erase some of it and correct
it.  If you like the place you have found, you can type &lt;RET&gt; to
remain there.  Or you can type <kbd>C-g</kbd>, which removes from the
search string the characters that could not be found (the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>&rsquo; in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>&rsquo;), leaving those that were found (the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>&rsquo; in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>&rsquo;).  A second <kbd>C-g</kbd> at that point cancels the search
entirely, returning point to where it was when the search started.

   <p><a name="index-quitting-_0028in-search_0029-652"></a>  The quit command, <kbd>C-g</kbd>, does special things during searches;
just what it does depends on the status of the search.  If the search
has found what you specified and is waiting for input, <kbd>C-g</kbd>
cancels the entire search, moving the cursor back to where you started
the search.  If <kbd>C-g</kbd> is typed when there are characters in the
search string that have not been found&mdash;because Emacs is still
searching for them, or because it has failed to find them&mdash;then the
search string characters which have not been found are discarded from
the search string.  With them gone, the search is now successful and
waiting for more input, so a second <kbd>C-g</kbd> will cancel the entire
search.
