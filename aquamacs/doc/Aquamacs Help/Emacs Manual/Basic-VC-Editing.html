<h4 class="subsection">32.1.3 Basic Editing under Version Control</h4>

<p><a name="index-filesets_002c-VC-2443"></a>   Most VC commands operate on <dfn>VC filesets</dfn>.  A VC fileset is a
collection of one or more files that a VC operation acts on.  When you
type VC commands in a buffer visiting a version-controlled file, the
VC fileset is simply that one file.  When you type them in a VC
Directory buffer, and some files in it are marked, the VC fileset
consists of the marked files (see <a href="VC-Directory-Mode.html#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>).

   <p>The principal VC command is an all-purpose command, <kbd>C-x v v</kbd>
(<code>vc-next-action</code>), that performs either registration, locking,
merging or a check-in (depending on the situation) on the current VC
fileset.  You can use <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> in a file-visiting buffer or in a
VC Directory buffer.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v v</kbd><dd>Perform the appropriate next version control operation on the VC fileset. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dnext_002daction-2444"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-v-2445"></a>  The precise action of <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> depends on the state of the VC
fileset, and whether the version control system uses locking or
merging.  This is described in detail in the subsequent sections.

   <p>VC filesets are the way that VC mode bridges the gap between
file-based and changeset-based version control systems.  They are,
essentially, a way to pass multiple file arguments as a group to
version control commands.  For example, on Subversion, a checkin with
a multi-file VC fileset becomes a joint commit, as though you had
typed <samp><span class="command">svn commit</span></samp> with those file arguments at the shell
command line.  All files in a VC fileset must be under the same
version control system; if they are not, Emacs signals an error when
you attempt to execute a command on the fileset.

   <p>Support for VC filesets and changeset-based version control systems
is the main improvement to VC in Emacs 23.  When you mark multi-file
VC in a VC Directory buffer, VC operations treat them as a VC fileset,
and operate on them all at once if the version control system is
changeset-based.  See <a href="VC-Directory-Mode.html#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>.

   <p>VC filesets are distinct from the &ldquo;named filesets&rdquo; used for
viewing and visiting files in functional groups (see <a href="Filesets.html#Filesets">Filesets</a>). 
Unlike named filesets, VC filesets are not named and don't persist
across sessions.
