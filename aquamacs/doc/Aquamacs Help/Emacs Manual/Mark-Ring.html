<h3 class="section">11.4 The Mark Ring</h3>

<p><a name="index-mark-ring-316"></a>  Aside from delimiting the region, the mark is also useful for
remembering spots that you may want to go back to.  Each buffer
remembers 16 previous locations of the mark, in the <dfn>mark ring</dfn>. 
Commands that set the mark also push the old mark onto this ring.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Set the mark, pushing it onto the mark ring, without activating it. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Move point to where the mark was, and restore the mark from the ring
of former marks. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dSPC-C_002dSPC-317"></a>  The command C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt; is handy when you want to use
the mark to remember a position to which you may wish to return.  It
pushes the current point onto the mark ring, without activating the
mark (which would cause Emacs to highlight the region).  This is
actually two consecutive invocations of <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>set-mark-command</code>); the first <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> sets the mark,
and the second <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> deactivates it.  (When Transient Mark
mode is off, C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt; instead activates Transient Mark
mode temporarily.  See <a href="Persistent-Mark.html#Persistent-Mark">Persistent Mark</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-C_002du-C_002dSPC-318"></a>  To return to a marked position, use <code>set-mark-command</code> with a
prefix argument: <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.  This moves point to where the
mark was, and deactivates the mark if it was active.  Each subsequent
<kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> jumps to a prior position stored in the mark
ring.  The positions you move through in this way are not lost; they
go to the end of the ring.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dmark_002dcommand_002drepeat_002dpop-319"></a>  If you set <code>set-mark-command-repeat-pop</code> to non-<code>nil</code>,
then immediately after you type <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, you can type
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> instead of <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> to cycle through
the mark ring.  By default, <code>set-mark-command-repeat-pop</code> is
<code>nil</code>.

   <p>Each buffer has its own mark ring.  All editing commands use the
current buffer's mark ring.  In particular, <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
always stays in the same buffer.

   <p><a name="index-mark_002dring_002dmax-320"></a>  The variable <code>mark-ring-max</code> specifies the maximum number of
entries to keep in the mark ring.  If that many entries exist and
another one is pushed, the earliest one in the list is discarded.  Repeating
<kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> cycles through the positions currently in the
ring.

   <p><a name="index-mark_002deven_002dif_002dinactive-321"></a>  If the variable <code>mark-even-if-inactive</code> is <code>nil</code>, commands
can only use the mark and the region when it is active.  This variable
is non-<code>nil</code> by default.

   <p>If you want to move back to the same place over and over, the mark
ring may not be convenient enough.  If so, you can record the position
in a register for later retrieval (see <a href="RegPos.html#RegPos">Saving Positions in Registers</a>).
