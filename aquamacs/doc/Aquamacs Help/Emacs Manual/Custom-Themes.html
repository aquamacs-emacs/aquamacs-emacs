<h4 class="subsection">57.2.7 Customization Themes</h4>

<p><a name="index-custom-themes-3969"></a>
  <dfn>Custom themes</dfn> are collections of settings that can be enabled
or disabled as a unit.  You can use Custom themes to switch quickly
and easily between various collections of settings, and to transfer
such collections from one computer to another.

   <p><a name="index-customize_002dcreate_002dtheme-3970"></a>  To define a Custom theme, use <kbd>M-x customize-create-theme</kbd>,
which brings up a buffer named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*New Custom Theme*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  At the top
of the buffer is an editable field where you can specify the name of
the theme.  Click on the button labelled &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Insert Variable</span></samp>&rsquo; to add
a variable to the theme, and click on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Insert Face</span></samp>&rsquo; to add a
face.  You can edit these values in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*New Custom Theme*</span></samp>&rsquo;
buffer like in an ordinary Customize buffer.  To remove an option from
the theme, click on its &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">State</span></samp>&rsquo; button and select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Delete</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-custom_002dtheme_002ddirectory-3971"></a>  After adding the desired options, click on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Save Theme</span></samp>&rsquo; to save
the Custom theme.  This writes the theme definition to a file
<samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">-theme.el</span></samp> (where <var>foo</var> is the theme name you
supplied), in the directory <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/</span></samp>.  You can specify the
directory by setting <code>custom-theme-directory</code>.

   <p>You can view and edit the settings of a previously-defined theme by
clicking on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Visit Theme</span></samp>&rsquo; and specifying the theme name.  You can
also import the variables and faces that you have set using Customize
by visiting the &ldquo;special&rdquo; theme named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">user</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This theme, which
records all the options that you set in the ordinary customization
buffer, is always enabled, and always takes precedence over all other
enabled Custom themes.  Additionally, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">user</span></samp>&rsquo; theme is
recorded with code in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, rather than a
<samp><span class="file">user-theme.el</span></samp> file.

   <p><a name="index-custom_002denabled_002dthemes-3972"></a>  Once you have defined a Custom theme, you can use it by customizing
the variable <code>custom-enabled-themes</code>.  This is a list of Custom
themes that are <dfn>enabled</dfn>, or put into effect.  If you set
<code>custom-enabled-themes</code> using the Customize interface, the theme
definitions are automatically loaded from the theme files, if they
aren't already.  If you save the value of <code>custom-enabled-themes</code>
for future Emacs sessions, those Custom themes will be enabled
whenever Emacs is started up.

   <p>If two enabled themes specify different values for an option, the
theme occurring earlier in <code>custom-enabled-themes</code> takes effect.

   <p><a name="index-load_002dtheme-3973"></a><a name="index-enable_002dtheme-3974"></a><a name="index-disable_002dtheme-3975"></a>  You can temporarily enable a Custom theme with <kbd>M-x
enable-theme</kbd>.  This prompts for a theme name in the minibuffer, loads
the theme from the theme file if necessary, and enables the theme. 
You can <dfn>disable</dfn> any enabled theme with the command <kbd>M-x
disable-theme</kbd>; this returns the options specified in the theme to
their original values.  To re-enable the theme, type <kbd>M-x
enable-theme</kbd> again.  If a theme file is changed during your Emacs
session, you can reload it by typing <kbd>M-x load-theme</kbd>.  (This also
enables the theme.)
