<h3 class="section">26.3 Language Environments</h3>

<p><a name="index-language-environments-1368"></a>
  All supported character sets are supported in Emacs buffers whenever
multibyte characters are enabled; there is no need to select a
particular language in order to display its characters in an Emacs
buffer.  However, it is important to select a <dfn>language
environment</dfn> in order to set various defaults.  Roughly speaking, the
language environment represents a choice of preferred script rather
than a choice of language.

   <p>The language environment controls which coding systems to recognize
when reading text (see <a href="Recognize-Coding.html#Recognize-Coding">Recognize Coding</a>).  This applies to files,
incoming mail, and any other text you read into Emacs.  It may also
specify the default coding system to use when you create a file.  Each
language environment also specifies a default input method.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dlanguage_002denvironment-1369"></a><a name="index-current_002dlanguage_002denvironment-1370"></a>  To select a language environment, customize the variable
<code>current-language-environment</code> or use the command <kbd>M-x
set-language-environment</kbd>.  It makes no difference which buffer is
current when you use this command, because the effects apply globally
to the Emacs session.  The supported language environments include:

   <p><a name="index-Euro-sign-1371"></a><a name="index-UTF_002d8-1372"></a><blockquote>
ASCII, Belarusian, Bengali, Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian,
Chinese-BIG5, Chinese-CNS, Chinese-EUC-TW, Chinese-GB, Chinese-GBK,
Chinese-GB18030, Croatian, Cyrillic-ALT, Cyrillic-ISO, Cyrillic-KOI8,
Czech, Devanagari, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Ethiopic, French,
Georgian, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, IPA, Italian, Japanese,
Kannada, Khmer, Korean, Lao, Latin-1, Latin-2, Latin-3, Latin-4,
Latin-5, Latin-6, Latin-7, Latin-8 (Celtic), Latin-9 (updated Latin-1
with the Euro sign), Latvian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Oriya, Polish,
Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish,
Swedish, TaiViet, Tajik, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Tibetan, Turkish, UTF-8
(for a setup which prefers Unicode characters and files encoded in
UTF-8), Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Welsh, and Windows-1255 (for a setup
which prefers Cyrillic characters and files encoded in Windows-1255). 
</blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-fonts-for-various-scripts-1373"></a><a name="index-Intlfonts-package_002c-installation-1374"></a>  To display the script(s) used by your language environment on a
graphical display, you need to have a suitable font.  If some of the
characters appear as empty boxes, you should install the GNU Intlfonts
package, which includes fonts for most supported scripts.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
See <a href="Fontsets.html#Fontsets">Fontsets</a>, for more details about setting up your fonts.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dlocale_002denvironment-1375"></a><a name="index-locale_002dlanguage_002dnames-1376"></a><a name="index-locale_002dcharset_002dlanguage_002dnames-1377"></a><a name="index-locales-1378"></a>  Some operating systems let you specify the character-set locale you
are using by setting the locale environment variables <samp><span class="env">LC_ALL</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>  During startup, Emacs looks up your character-set locale's
name in the system locale alias table, matches its canonical name
against entries in the value of the variables
<code>locale-charset-language-names</code> and <code>locale-language-names</code>,
and selects the corresponding language environment if a match is found. 
(The former variable overrides the latter.)  It also adjusts the display
table and terminal coding system, the locale coding system, the
preferred coding system as needed for the locale, and&mdash;last but not
least&mdash;the way Emacs decodes non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters sent by your keyboard.

   <p>If you modify the <samp><span class="env">LC_ALL</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>
environment variables while running Emacs, you may want to invoke the
<code>set-locale-environment</code> function afterwards to readjust the
language environment from the new locale.

   <p><a name="index-locale_002dpreferred_002dcoding_002dsystems-1379"></a>  The <code>set-locale-environment</code> function normally uses the preferred
coding system established by the language environment to decode system
messages.  But if your locale matches an entry in the variable
<code>locale-preferred-coding-systems</code>, Emacs uses the corresponding
coding system instead.  For example, if the locale &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ja_JP.PCK</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches <code>japanese-shift-jis</code> in
<code>locale-preferred-coding-systems</code>, Emacs uses that encoding even
though it might normally use <code>japanese-iso-8bit</code>.

   <p>You can override the language environment chosen at startup with
explicit use of the command <code>set-language-environment</code>, or with
customization of <code>current-language-environment</code> in your init
file.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dh-L-1380"></a><a name="index-describe_002dlanguage_002denvironment-1381"></a>  To display information about the effects of a certain language
environment <var>lang-env</var>, use the command <kbd>C-h L </kbd><var>lang-env</var><kbd>
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>describe-language-environment</code>).  This tells you
which languages this language environment is useful for, and lists the
character sets, coding systems, and input methods that go with it.  It
also shows some sample text to illustrate scripts used in this
language environment.  If you give an empty input for <var>lang-env</var>,
this command describes the chosen language environment. 
<a name="Describe-Language-Environment"></a><a name="index-set_002dlanguage_002denvironment_002dhook-1382"></a>  You can customize any language environment with the normal hook
<code>set-language-environment-hook</code>.  The command
<code>set-language-environment</code> runs that hook after setting up the new
language environment.  The hook functions can test for a specific
language environment by checking the variable
<code>current-language-environment</code>.  This hook is where you should
put non-default settings for specific language environment, such as
coding systems for keyboard input and terminal output, the default
input method, etc.

   <p><a name="index-exit_002dlanguage_002denvironment_002dhook-1383"></a>  Before it starts to set up the new language environment,
<code>set-language-environment</code> first runs the hook
<code>exit-language-environment-hook</code>.  This hook is useful for undoing
customizations that were made with <code>set-language-environment-hook</code>. 
For instance, if you set up a special key binding in a specific language
environment using <code>set-language-environment-hook</code>, you should set
up <code>exit-language-environment-hook</code> to restore the normal binding
for that key.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> If
you run Emacs on X, you need to inform the X server about the location
of the newly installed fonts with the following commands:

<pre class="example">      xset fp+ /usr/local/share/emacs/fonts
      xset fp rehash
</pre>
   <p></p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> If more than one of these is
set, the first one that is nonempty specifies your locale for this
purpose.</p>
