<h3 class="appendixsec">C.6 Specifying the Display Name</h3>

<p><a name="index-display-name-_0028X-Window-System_0029-4196"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bDISPLAY_007d-environment-variable-4197"></a>
  The environment variable <samp><span class="env">DISPLAY</span></samp> tells all X clients, including
Emacs, where to display their windows.  Its value is set by default
in ordinary circumstances, when you start an X server and run jobs
locally.  Occasionally you may need to specify the display yourself; for
example, if you do a remote login and want to run a client program
remotely, displaying on your local screen.

   <p>With Emacs, the main reason people change the default display is to
let them log into another system, run Emacs on that system, but have the
window displayed at their local terminal.  You might need to log in
to another system because the files you want to edit are there, or
because the Emacs executable file you want to run is there.

   <p>The syntax of the <samp><span class="env">DISPLAY</span></samp> environment variable is
&lsquo;<samp><var>host</var><span class="samp">:</span><var>display</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>screen</var></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>host</var> is the
host name of the X Window System server machine, <var>display</var> is an
arbitrarily-assigned number that distinguishes your server (X terminal)
from other servers on the same machine, and <var>screen</var> is a
rarely-used field that allows an X server to control multiple terminal
screens.  The period and the <var>screen</var> field are optional.  If
included, <var>screen</var> is usually zero.

   <p>For example, if your host is named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">glasperle</span></samp>&rsquo; and your server is
the first (or perhaps the only) server listed in the configuration, your
<samp><span class="env">DISPLAY</span></samp> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">glasperle:0.0</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>You can specify the display name explicitly when you run Emacs, either
by changing the <samp><span class="env">DISPLAY</span></samp> variable, or with the option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-d
</span><var>display</var></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--display=</span><var>display</var></samp>&rsquo;.  Here is an example:

<pre class="smallexample">     emacs --display=glasperle:0 &amp;
</pre>
   <p>You can inhibit the direct use of the window system and GUI with the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-nw</span></samp>&rsquo; option.  It tells Emacs to display using ordinary <acronym>ASCII</acronym> on
its controlling terminal.  This is also an initial option.

   <p>Sometimes, security arrangements prevent a program on a remote system
from displaying on your local system.  In this case, trying to run Emacs
produces messages like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Xlib:  connection to "glasperle:0.0" refused by server
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You might be able to overcome this problem by using the <samp><span class="command">xhost</span></samp>
command on the local system to give permission for access from your
remote machine.
