<h3 class="section">16.1 Undo</h3>
<a name="index-undo"></a>
<a name="index-changes_002c-undoing"></a>

<p>The <em>undo</em> command reverses recent changes in the buffer&rsquo;s text.
Each buffer records changes individually, and the undo command always
applies to the current buffer.  You can undo all the changes in a
buffer for as far back as the buffer&rsquo;s records go.  Usually, each editing
command makes a separate entry in the undo records, but some commands
such as <code>query-replace</code> divide their changes into multiple
entries for flexibility in undoing.  Consecutive character insertion
commands are usually grouped together into a single undo record, to
make undoing less tedious.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><kbd>C-/</kbd></dt>
<dt><kbd>C-x u</kbd></dt>
<dt><kbd>C-_</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Undo one entry in the current buffer&rsquo;s undo records (<code>undo</code>).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-C_002dx-u"></a>
<a name="index-C_002d_005f"></a>
<a name="index-C_002d_002f"></a>
<a name="index-undo-1"></a>
<p>To begin to undo, type <kbd>C-/</kbd> (or its aliases, <kbd>C-_</kbd> or
<kbd>C-x u</kbd>)<a name="DOCF6" href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a>.  This undoes the most recent change in the buffer,
and moves point back to where it was before that change.
  Consecutive repetitions of <kbd>C-/</kbd> (or its aliases) undo earlier
and earlier changes in the current buffer.  If all the recorded
changes have already been undone, the undo command signals an error.
</p>
<a name="index-redo"></a>
<a name="index-undo_002donly"></a>
<p>Any command other than an undo command breaks the sequence of undo
commands.  Starting from that moment, the entire sequence of undo
commands that you have just performed are themselves placed into the
undo record, as a single set of changes.  Therefore, to re-apply
changes you have undone, type <kbd>C-f</kbd> or any other command that
harmlessly breaks the sequence of undoing; then type <kbd>C-/</kbd> to undo
the undo command.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to resume undoing, without redoing
previous undo commands, use <kbd>M-x undo-only</kbd>.  This is like
<code>undo</code>, but will not redo changes you have just undone.
</p>
<p>If you notice that a buffer has been modified accidentally, the
easiest way to recover is to type <kbd>C-/</kbd> repeatedly until the stars
disappear from the front of the mode line (see <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).
Whenever an undo command makes the stars disappear from the mode line,
it means that the buffer contents are the same as they were when the
file was last read in or saved.  If you do not remember whether you
changed the buffer deliberately, type <kbd>C-/</kbd> once.  When you see
the last change you made undone, you will see whether it was an
intentional change.  If it was an accident, leave it undone.  If it
was deliberate, redo the change as described above.
</p>
<a name="index-selective-undo"></a>
<a name="index-C_002du-C_002d_002f"></a>
<p>When there is an active region, any use of <code>undo</code> performs
<em>selective undo</em>: it undoes the most recent change within the
region, instead of the entire buffer.  However, when Transient Mark
mode is off (see <a href="Disabled-Transient-Mark.html#Disabled-Transient-Mark">Disabled Transient Mark</a>), <kbd>C-/</kbd> always
operates on the entire buffer, ignoring the region.  In this case, you
can perform selective undo by supplying a prefix argument to the
<code>undo</code> command: <kbd>C-u C-/</kbd>.  To undo further changes in the
same region, repeat the <code>undo</code> command (no prefix argument is
needed).
</p>
<p>Some specialized buffers do not make undo records.  Buffers whose
names start with spaces never do; these buffers are used internally by
Emacs to hold text that users don&rsquo;t normally look at or edit.
</p>
<a name="index-undo_002dlimit"></a>
<a name="index-undo_002dstrong_002dlimit"></a>
<a name="index-undo_002douter_002dlimit"></a>
<a name="index-undo-limit"></a>
<p>When the undo information for a buffer becomes too large, Emacs discards
the oldest records from time to time (during <em>garbage
collection</em>).  You can specify how much undo information to keep by
setting the variables <code>undo-limit</code>, <code>undo-strong-limit</code>, and
<code>undo-outer-limit</code>.  Their values are expressed in bytes.
</p>
<p>The variable <code>undo-limit</code> sets a soft limit: Emacs keeps undo
data for enough commands to reach this size, and perhaps exceed it,
but does not keep data for any earlier commands beyond that.  Its
default value is 80000.  The variable <code>undo-strong-limit</code> sets a
stricter limit: any previous command (though not the most recent one)
that pushes the size past this amount is forgotten.  The default value
of <code>undo-strong-limit</code> is 120000.
</p>
<p>Regardless of the values of those variables, the most recent change
is never discarded unless it gets bigger than <code>undo-outer-limit</code>
(normally 12,000,000).  At that point, Emacs discards the undo data and
warns you about it.  This is the only situation in which you cannot
undo the last command.  If this happens, you can increase the value of
<code>undo-outer-limit</code> to make it even less likely to happen in the
future.  But if you didn&rsquo;t expect the command to create such large
undo data, then it is probably a bug and you should report it.

<h3><a name="FOOT6" href="#DOCF6">(6)</a></h3>
<p>Aside from <kbd>C-/</kbd>, the <code>undo</code> command is
also bound to <kbd>C-x u</kbd> because that is more straightforward for
beginners to remember: &lsquo;<samp>u</samp>&rsquo; stands for &ldquo;undo&rdquo;.  It is also bound
to <kbd>C-_</kbd> because typing <kbd>C-/</kbd> on some text terminals actually
enters <kbd>C-_</kbd>.</p>
