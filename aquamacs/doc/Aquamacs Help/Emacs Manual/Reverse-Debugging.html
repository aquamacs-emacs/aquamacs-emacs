<h5 class="subsubsection">31.6.5.7 Reverse Debugging</h5>

<p>The GDB tool bar shares many buttons with the other GUD debuggers
for tasks like stepping and printing expressions.  It also has a
further set of buttons that allow reverse debugging (see <a href="../gdb/Process-Record-and-Replay.html#Process-Record-and-Replay">Process Record and Replay</a>).  This is useful when it
takes a long time to reproduce the conditions where your program fails
or for transient problems, like race conditions in multi-threaded
programs, where a failure might otherwise be hard to reproduce.

   <p>To use reverse debugging, set a breakpoint slightly before the
location of interest and run your program to that point.  Enable
process recording by clicking on the record button.  At this point, a
new set of buttons appear.  These buttons allow program execution in
the reverse direction.  Run your program over the code where the
problem occurs, and then use the new set of buttons to retrace your
steps, examine values, and analyze the problem.  When analysis is
complete, turn off process recording by clicking on the record button
again.
