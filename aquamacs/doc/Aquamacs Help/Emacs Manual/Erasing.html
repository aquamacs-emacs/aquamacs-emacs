(<code>backward-kill-word</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>The key <kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> (<code>delete-backward-char</code>) removes the
character before point, moving the cursor and all the characters after
it backwards.  On most keyboards, &lt;DEL&gt; is labelled
&lt;Backspace&gt;, but we refer to it as &lt;DEL&gt; in this manual.  Do
not confuse &lt;DEL&gt; with another key, labelled &lt;Delete&gt;, that
exists on many keyboards; we will discuss &lt;Delete&gt; momentarily.

   <p>Typing &lt;DEL&gt; when the cursor is at the beginning of a line
deletes the preceding newline character, joining the line with the one
before it.

   <p>On some text-only terminals, Emacs may not recognize the &lt;DEL&gt;
key properly.  If &lt;DEL&gt; does not do the right thing (e.g., if it
deletes characters forwards), see <a href="DEL-Does-Not-Delete.html#DEL-Does-Not-Delete">DEL Does Not Delete</a>.

   <p><a name="index-killing-characters-and-lines-108"></a><a name="index-deleting-characters-and-lines-109"></a><a name="index-erasing-characters-and-lines-110"></a>  The key <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>delete-char</code>) deletes the character after
point, i.e., the character under the cursor.  This shifts the rest of
the text on the line to the left.  If you type <kbd>C-d</kbd> at the end of
a line, it joins that line with the following line.  This command is
also bound to the key labelled &lt;Delete&gt; on many keyboards.

   <p>To erase a larger amount of text, use the <kbd>C-k</kbd> key, which
erases (kills) a line at a time.  If you type <kbd>C-k</kbd> at the
beginning or middle of a line, it kills all the text up to the end of
the line.  If you type <kbd>C-k</kbd> at the end of a line, it joins that
line with the following line.

   <p>To learn more about killing text, see <a href="Killing.html#Killing">Killing</a>.
