<h4 class="subsection">38.10.1 Displaying the Diary</h4>

<p>Once you have created a diary file, you can use the calendar to view
it.  You can also view today's events outside of Calendar mode.  In the
following, key bindings refer to the Calendar buffer.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Display all diary entries for the selected date
(<code>diary-view-entries</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>Mouse-3 Diary</kbd><dd>Display all diary entries for the date you click on. 
<br><dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd>Display the entire diary file (<code>diary-show-all-entries</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>m</kbd><dd>Mark all visible dates that have diary entries
(<code>diary-mark-entries</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Unmark the calendar window (<code>calendar-unmark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x diary-print-entries</kbd><dd>Print hard copy of the diary display as it appears. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x diary</kbd><dd>Display all diary entries for today's date. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x diary-mail-entries</kbd><dd>Mail yourself email reminders about upcoming diary entries. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-d-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3334"></a><a name="index-diary_002dview_002dentries-3335"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dview_002ddiary_002dinitially_002dflag-3336"></a>  Displaying the diary entries with <kbd>d</kbd> shows in a separate window
the diary entries for the selected date in the calendar.  The mode line
of the new window shows the date of the diary entries.  Holidays are
shown either in the buffer or in the mode line, depending on the display
method you choose
(see <a href="Diary-Display.html#Diary-Display">Diary Display</a>). 
If you specify a numeric argument with <kbd>d</kbd>, it shows all the diary
entries for that many successive days.  Thus, <kbd>2 d</kbd> displays all the
entries for the selected date and for the following day.

   <p>Another way to display the diary entries for a date is to click
<kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> on the date, and then choose <kbd>Diary entries</kbd> from
the menu that appears.  If the variable
<code>calendar-view-diary-initially-flag</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, creating the
calendar lists the diary entries for the current date (provided the
current date is visible).

   <p><a name="index-m-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3337"></a><a name="index-diary_002dmark_002dentries-3338"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dmark_002ddiary_002dentries_002dflag-3339"></a>  To get a broader view of which days are mentioned in the diary, use
the <kbd>m</kbd> command.  This marks the dates that have diary entries in
a different face. 
See <a href="Calendar-Customizing.html#Calendar-Customizing">diary-entry-marker</a>.

   <p>The command applies both to the currently visible months and to
other months that subsequently become visible by scrolling.  To turn
marking off and erase the current marks, type <kbd>u</kbd>, which also
turns off holiday marks (see <a href="Holidays.html#Holidays">Holidays</a>).  If the variable
<code>calendar-mark-diary-entries-flag</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, creating or
updating the calendar marks diary dates automatically.

   <p><a name="index-s-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3340"></a><a name="index-diary_002dshow_002dall_002dentries-3341"></a>  To see the full diary file, rather than just some of the entries, use
the <kbd>s</kbd> command.

   <p><a name="index-diary-3342"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x diary</kbd> displays the diary entries for the current
date, independently of the calendar display, and optionally for the next
few days as well; the variable <code>diary-number-of-entries</code> specifies
how many days to include. 
See <a href="Diary-Customizing.html#Diary-Customizing">diary-number-of-entries</a>.

   <p>If you put <code>(diary)</code> in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, this
automatically displays a window with the day's diary entries, when you
enter Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dmail_002dentries-3343"></a><a name="index-diary_002dmail_002ddays-3344"></a>  Many users like to receive notice of events in their diary as email. 
To send such mail to yourself, use the command <kbd>M-x
diary-mail-entries</kbd>.  A prefix argument specifies how many days
(starting with today) to check; otherwise, the variable
<code>diary-mail-days</code> says how many days.
