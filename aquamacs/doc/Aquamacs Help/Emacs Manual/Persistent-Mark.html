  By default, the mark is activated by setting it, and deactivated by
most non-motion commands (including all commands that change the text
in the buffer).  This behavior is called Transient Mark
mode<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>Turning off Transient Mark mode switches Emacs to an alternative
mode of operation, which was the default prior to Emacs 23.  When
Transient Mark mode is off, the mark is <em>never</em> deactivated, but
it can be set to different locations using commands such as
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.  Emacs does not highlight the region, because that
would be a nuisance.  As a special exception, the region is
temporarily highlighted if you set it with the mouse (see <a href="Setting-Mark.html#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>), or with shift-selection (see <a href="Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>).

   <p><a name="index-transient_002dmark_002dmode-331"></a>  To turn off Transient Mark mode, type <kbd>M-x transient-mark-mode</kbd>. 
This command toggles the mode; you can use the same command to turn it
on again.  You can also toggle Transient Mark mode using the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Active Region Highlighting</span></samp>&rsquo; menu item in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Options</span></samp>&rsquo;
menu.

   <p>Here are the details of how Emacs behaves when Transient Mark mode
is off:

     <ul>
<li>Emacs does not show where the mark is located&mdash;you have to remember. 
The usual solution to this problem is to set the mark and then use it
soon, before you forget where it is.  Alternatively, you can check the
location of the mark by using <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd>, which exchanges the
positions of the point and the mark (see <a href="Setting-Mark.html#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>).

     <li>Many commands that insert text, such as <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>yank</code>),
position point and the mark at opposite ends of the inserted text, so
that the region consists of the text just inserted.  You can tell when
a command sets the mark because it displays &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Mark set</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
echo area.

     <li>Many commands that move point long distances, like <kbd>M-&lt;</kbd> and
<kbd>C-s</kbd>, first set the mark where point was.

     <li>Some commands, which ordinarily act on the region when the mark is
active, no longer do so.  For example, normally <kbd>M-%</kbd>
(<code>query-replace</code>) performs replacements within the region, if the
mark is active.  When Transient Mark mode is off, it always operates
from point to the end of the buffer.  Commands that act this way are
identified in their own documentation. 
</ul>

   <p>While Transient Mark mode is off, you can activate it temporarily
using <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>C-u C-x C-x</kbd>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002d_0040key_007bSPC_007d-C_002d_0040key_007bSPC_007d-332"></a>Set the mark at point (like plain <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>) and enable
Transient Mark mode just once, until the mark is deactivated.  (This
is not really a separate command; you are using the <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
command twice.)

     <br><dt><kbd>C-u C-x C-x</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002du-C_002dx-C_002dx-333"></a>Activate the mark and enable Transient Mark mode temporarily, until
the mark is next deactivated.  (This is the <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> command,
<code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>, with a prefix argument.) 
</dl>

   <p>These commands set or activate the mark, and enable Transient Mark
mode only until the mark is deactivated.  One reason you may want to
use them is that some commands operate on the entire buffer instead of
the region when Transient Mark mode is off.  Enabling Transient Mark
mode momentarily gives you a way to use these commands on the region.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> It is also sometimes called <dfn>Zmacs mode</dfn>, because
the Zmacs editor on the MIT Lisp Machine handled the mark in a similar
way.</p>
