&ldquo;minimize&rdquo; the selected frame (<code>suspend-emacs</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dc-51"></a><a name="index-save_002dbuffers_002dkill_002dterminal-52"></a>  <dfn>Killing</dfn> Emacs means terminating the Emacs program.  To do
this, type <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> (<code>save-buffers-kill-terminal</code>).  A
two-character key is used to make it harder to type by accident.  If
there are any modified file-visiting buffers when you type <kbd>C-x
C-c</kbd>, Emacs first offers to save these buffers.  If you do not save
them all, it asks for confirmation again, since the unsaved changes
will be lost.  Emacs also asks for confirmation if any subprocesses
are still running, since killing Emacs will also kill the subprocesses
(see <a href="Shell.html#Shell">Shell</a>).

   <p><kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> behaves specially if you are using Emacs as a server. 
If you type it from a &ldquo;client frame&rdquo;, it closes the client
connection.  See <a href="Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>.

   <p>Emacs can, optionally, record certain session information when you
kill it, such as the files you were visiting at the time.  This
information is then available the next time you start Emacs. 
See <a href="Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html#Saving-Emacs-Sessions">Saving Emacs Sessions</a>.

   <p><a name="index-confirm_002dkill_002demacs-53"></a>  If the value of the variable <code>confirm-kill-emacs</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> assumes that its value is a predicate
function, and calls that function.  If the result of the function call
is non-<code>nil</code>, the session is killed, otherwise Emacs continues to
run.  One convenient function to use as the value of
<code>confirm-kill-emacs</code> is the function <code>yes-or-no-p</code>.  The
default value of <code>confirm-kill-emacs</code> is <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002demacs-54"></a>  To kill Emacs without being prompted about saving, type <kbd>M-x
kill-emacs</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-minimizing-a-frame-55"></a><a name="index-iconifying-56"></a><a name="index-suspending-57"></a>  You can &ldquo;exit&rdquo; Emacs in two other ways.  On a graphical display,
you can <dfn>minimize</dfn> (or <dfn>iconify</dfn>) an Emacs frame; depending on
the window system, this either replaces the Emacs frame with a tiny
&ldquo;icon&rdquo; or conceals the frame entirely (see <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>).  On a
text-only terminal, you can <dfn>suspend</dfn> Emacs; this means stopping
the Emacs program temporarily, returning control to its parent process
(usually a shell).

   <p><a name="index-C_002dz-58"></a><a name="index-suspend_002dframe-59"></a>  <kbd>C-z</kbd> runs the command <code>suspend-frame</code>.  On a graphical
display, this &ldquo;minimizes&rdquo; (or &ldquo;iconifies&rdquo;) the selected Emacs
frame.  On a text terminal, this suspends the Emacs process.

   <p>After minimizing or suspending Emacs, you can return to it and
continue editing wherever you left off.  The way to do this depends on
the window system or shell.  In most common shells, you can resume
Emacs after suspending it with the shell command <samp><span class="command">%emacs</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-cannot_002dsuspend-60"></a>  On very old systems that don't support suspending programs,
<kbd>C-z</kbd> starts an inferior shell that communicates directly with the
terminal, and Emacs waits until you exit the subshell.  (The way to
exit the subshell is usually <kbd>C-d</kbd> or <samp><span class="command">exit</span></samp>.)  On these
systems, you can only get back to the shell from which Emacs was run
(to log out, for example) when you kill Emacs.  Suspending can also
fail if you run Emacs under a shell that doesn't support suspending
jobs, even if the system itself does support it.  In this case, you
can set the variable <code>cannot-suspend</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value
to force <kbd>C-z</kbd> to start an inferior shell.

   <p>Text-only terminals usually listen for certain special characters
whose meaning is to kill or suspend the program you are running. 
<b>This terminal feature is turned off while you are in Emacs.</b>  The
meanings of <kbd>C-z</kbd> and <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> as keys in Emacs were inspired
by the use of <kbd>C-z</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd> on several operating systems as
the characters for stopping or killing a program, but that is their
only relationship with the operating system.  You can customize these
keys to run any commands of your choice (see <a href="Keymaps.html#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>).
