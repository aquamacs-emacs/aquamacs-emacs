<h4 class="subsection">22.6.3 Recovering Data from Auto-Saves</h4>

<p><a name="index-recover_002dfile-909"></a>  You can use the contents of an auto-save file to recover from a loss
of data with the command <kbd>M-x recover-file &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>file</var><kbd>
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  This visits <var>file</var> and then (after your confirmation)
restores the contents from its auto-save file <samp><span class="file">#</span><var>file</var><span class="file">#</span></samp>. 
You can then save with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> to put the recovered text into
<var>file</var> itself.  For example, to recover file <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> from its
auto-save file <samp><span class="file">#foo.c#</span></samp>, do:

<pre class="example">     M-x recover-file &lt;RET&gt; foo.c &lt;RET&gt;
     yes &lt;RET&gt;
     C-x C-s
</pre>
   <p>Before asking for confirmation, <kbd>M-x recover-file</kbd> displays a
directory listing describing the specified file and the auto-save file,
so you can compare their sizes and dates.  If the auto-save file
is older, <kbd>M-x recover-file</kbd> does not offer to read it.

   <p><a name="index-recover_002dsession-910"></a>  If Emacs or the computer crashes, you can recover all the files you
were editing from their auto save files with the command <kbd>M-x
recover-session</kbd>.  This first shows you a list of recorded interrupted
sessions.  Move point to the one you choose, and type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>.

   <p>Then <code>recover-session</code> asks about each of the files that were
being edited during that session, asking whether to recover that file. 
If you answer <kbd>y</kbd>, it calls <code>recover-file</code>, which works in its
normal fashion.  It shows the dates of the original file and its
auto-save file, and asks once again whether to recover that file.

   <p>When <code>recover-session</code> is done, the files you've chosen to
recover are present in Emacs buffers.  You should then save them.  Only
this&mdash;saving them&mdash;updates the files themselves.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dlist_002dfile_002dprefix-911"></a>  Emacs records information about interrupted sessions for later
recovery in files named
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/.saves-</span><var>pid</var><span class="file">-</span><var>hostname</var></samp>.  The
directory used, <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/auto-save-list/</span></samp>, is determined by
the variable <code>auto-save-list-file-prefix</code>.  You can record
sessions in a different place by customizing that variable.  If you
set <code>auto-save-list-file-prefix</code> to <code>nil</code> in your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, sessions are not recorded for recovery.
