<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.3.1 Basic Version Control with Merging</h5>

<p>When your version control system is merging-based (the default for
CVS and all newer version control systems), work files are always
writable; you need not do anything special to begin editing a file. 
The status indicator on the mode line is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; if the file is
unmodified; it flips to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; as soon as you save any changes
(see <a href="VC-Mode-Line.html#VC-Mode-Line">VC Mode Line</a>).

   <p>Here is what <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> does when using a merging-based system:

     <ul>
<li>If the work file is in a directory that is not controlled by any
version control system, prompt for a repository type.  Then, create a
version control repository of that type and register the file with it.

     <li>If the work file is in a directory that is controlled by a version
control system but not registered with it, register the file.

     <li>If the work file is the same as in the repository, do nothing.

     <li>If you have not changed the work file, but some other user has checked
in changes to the repository, merge those changes into the work file.

     <li>If you have made modifications to the work file, attempts to check in
your changes.  To do this, Emacs first reads the log entry for the new
revision (see <a href="Log-Buffer.html#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>).  If some other user has checked in
changes to the repository since you last checked it out, the checkin
fails.  In that case, type <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> again to merge those changes
into your own work file; this puts the work file into a &ldquo;conflicted&rdquo;
state.  Type <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> to clear the &ldquo;conflicted&rdquo; state; VC then
regards the file as up-to-date and modified, and you can try to check
it in again.

     <p>To pick up any recent changes from the repository <em>without</em>
trying to commit your own changes, type <kbd>C-x v m &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
See <a href="Merging.html#Merging">Merging</a>. 
</ul>

   <p>These rules also apply when you use RCS in its &ldquo;non-locking&rdquo; mode,
except that changes are not automatically merged from the repository. 
Nothing informs you if another user has checked in changes in the same
file since you began editing it; when you check in your revision, his
changes are removed (however, they remain in the repository and are
thus not irrevocably lost).  Therefore, you must verify that the
current revision is unchanged before checking in your changes.  In
addition, locking is possible with RCS even in this mode: <kbd>C-x v
v</kbd> with an unmodified file locks the file, just as it does with RCS in
its normal locking mode (see <a href="VC-With-A-Locking-VCS.html#VC-With-A-Locking-VCS">VC With A Locking VCS</a>).
