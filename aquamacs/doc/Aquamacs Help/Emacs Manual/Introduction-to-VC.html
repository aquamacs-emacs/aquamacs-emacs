<h4 class="subsection">32.1.1 Introduction to Version Control</h4>

<p>VC allows you to use a version control system from within Emacs,
integrating the version control operations smoothly with editing. 
Though VC cannot completely bridge the gaps between version control
systems with widely differing capabilities, it does provide a uniform
interface to many version control operations. Regardless of which
version control system is in use, you will be able to do basic
operations in much the same way.

   <p>This section provides a general overview of version control, and
describes the version control systems that VC supports.  You can skip
this section if you are already familiar with the version control system
you want to use.
