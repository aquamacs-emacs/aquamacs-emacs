<h3 class="section">32.5 Emacs Development Environment</h3>

<p><a name="index-EDE-_0028Emacs-Development-Environment_0029-2590"></a><a name="index-Emacs-Development-Environment-2591"></a><a name="index-Integrated-development-environment-2592"></a>
EDE (<dfn>Emacs Development Environment</dfn>) is a package that simplifies
the task of creating, building, and debugging large programs with
Emacs.  It provides some of the features of an IDE, or <dfn>Integrated
Development Environment</dfn>, in Emacs.

   <p>This section provides a brief description of EDE usage. 
For full details, see <a href="../ede/index.html#Top">EDE</a>.

   <p>EDE is implemented as a global minor mode (see <a href="Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  To
enable it, type <kbd>M-x global-ede-mode</kbd> or click on the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Project Support (EDE)</span></samp>&rsquo; item in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Tools</span></samp>&rsquo; menu.  You can
also enable EDE each time you start Emacs, by adding the following
line to your initialization file:

<pre class="smallexample">     (global-ede-mode t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Activating EDE adds a menu named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Development</span></samp>&rsquo; to the menu bar. 
Many EDE commands, including the ones described below, can be invoked
from this menu.

   <p>EDE organizes files into <dfn>projects</dfn>, which correspond to
directory trees.  The <dfn>project root</dfn> is the topmost directory of a
project.  To define a new project, visit a file in the desired project
root and type <kbd>M-x ede-new</kbd>.  This command prompts for a
<dfn>project type</dfn>, which refers to the underlying method that EDE
will use to manage the project (see <a href="../ede/Creating-a-Project.html#Creating-a-Project">EDE</a>).  The most common project types are
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Make</span></samp>&rsquo;, which uses Makefiles, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Automake</span></samp>&rsquo;, which uses GNU
Automake (see <a href="../automake/index.html#Top">Automake</a>).  In both cases,
EDE also creates a file named <samp><span class="file">Project.ede</span></samp>, which stores
information about the project.

   <p>A project may contain one or more <dfn>targets</dfn>.  A target can be an
object file, executable program, or some other type of file, which is
&ldquo;built&rdquo; from one or more of the files in the project.

   <p>To add a new <dfn>target</dfn> to a project, type <kbd>C-c . t</kbd>
(<code>M-x ede-new-target</code>).  This command also asks if you wish to
&ldquo;add&rdquo; the current file to that target, which means that the target
is to be built from that file.  After you have defined a target, you
can add more files to it by typing <kbd>C-c . a</kbd>
(<code>ede-add-file</code>).

   <p>To build a target, type <kbd>C-c . c</kbd> (<code>ede-compile-target</code>). 
To build all the targets in the project, type <kbd>C-c . C</kbd>
(<code>ede-compile-project</code>).  EDE uses the file types to guess how
the target should be built.
