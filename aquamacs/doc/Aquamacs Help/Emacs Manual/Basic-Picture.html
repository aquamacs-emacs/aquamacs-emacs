<h3 class="section">34.1 Basic Editing in Picture Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-picture_002dforward_002dcolumn-2643"></a><a name="index-picture_002dbackward_002dcolumn-2644"></a><a name="index-picture_002dmove_002ddown-2645"></a><a name="index-picture_002dmove_002dup-2646"></a><a name="index-editing-in-Picture-mode-2647"></a>
  Most keys do the same thing in Picture mode that they usually do, but
do it in a quarter-plane style.  For example, <kbd>C-f</kbd> is rebound to
run <code>picture-forward-column</code>, a command which moves point one
column to the right, inserting a space if necessary so that the actual
end of the line makes no difference.  <kbd>C-b</kbd> is rebound to run
<code>picture-backward-column</code>, which always moves point left one
column, converting a tab to multiple spaces if necessary.  <kbd>C-n</kbd> and
<kbd>C-p</kbd> are rebound to run <code>picture-move-down</code> and
<code>picture-move-up</code>, which can either insert spaces or convert tabs
as necessary to make sure that point stays in exactly the same column. 
<kbd>C-e</kbd> runs <code>picture-end-of-line</code>, which moves to after the last
nonblank character on the line.  There is no need to change <kbd>C-a</kbd>,
as the choice of screen model does not affect beginnings of
lines.

   <p><a name="index-picture_002dnewline-2648"></a>  Insertion of text is adapted to the quarter-plane screen model
through the use of Overwrite mode
(see <a href="Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>.) 
Self-inserting characters replace existing text, column by column,
rather than pushing existing text to the right.  &lt;RET&gt; runs
<code>picture-newline</code>, which just moves to the beginning of the
following line so that new text will replace that line.

   <p><a name="index-picture_002dbackward_002dclear_002dcolumn-2649"></a><a name="index-picture_002dclear_002dcolumn-2650"></a><a name="index-picture_002dclear_002dline-2651"></a>  In Picture mode, the commands that normally delete or kill text,
instead erase text (replacing it with spaces).  &lt;DEL&gt;
(<code>picture-backward-clear-column</code>) replaces the preceding
character with a space rather than removing it; this moves point
backwards.  <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>picture-clear-column</code>) replaces the next
character or characters with spaces, but does not move point.  (If you
want to clear characters to spaces and move forward over them, use
&lt;SPC&gt;.)  <kbd>C-k</kbd> (<code>picture-clear-line</code>) really kills the
contents of lines, but does not delete the newlines from the buffer.

   <p><a name="index-picture_002dopen_002dline-2652"></a>  To do actual insertion, you must use special commands.  <kbd>C-o</kbd>
(<code>picture-open-line</code>) creates a blank line after the current
line; it never splits a line.  <kbd>C-M-o</kbd> (<code>split-line</code>) makes
sense in Picture mode, so it is not changed.  <kbd>C-j</kbd>
(<code>picture-duplicate-line</code>) inserts another line with the same
contents below the current line.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dd-_0040r_007b_0028Picture-mode_0029_007d-2653"></a>   To do actual deletion in Picture mode, use <kbd>C-w</kbd>, <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>
(which is defined as <code>delete-char</code>, as <kbd>C-d</kbd> is in other
modes), or one of the picture rectangle commands (see <a href="Rectangles-in-Picture.html#Rectangles-in-Picture">Rectangles in Picture</a>).
