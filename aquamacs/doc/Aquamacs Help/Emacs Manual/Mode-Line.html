<h3 class="section">1.3 The Mode Line</h3>

<p><a name="index-mode-line-12"></a><a name="index-top-level-13"></a>
  At the bottom of each window is a <dfn>mode line</dfn>, which describes
what is going on in the current buffer.  When there is only one
window, the mode line appears right above the echo area; it is the
next-to-last line in the frame.  On a graphical display, the mode line
is drawn with a 3D box appearance, and the mode line of the selected
window has a brighter color than that of unselected windows to make it
stand out.  On a text-only terminal, the mode line is usually drawn in
inverse video.

   <p>The text displayed in the mode line has the following format:

<pre class="example">     -<var>cs</var>:<var>ch</var>-<var>fr</var>  <var>buf</var>      <var>pos</var> <var>line</var>   (<var>major</var> <var>minor</var>)------
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <var>cs</var> string and the colon character after it describe the
character set and newline convention used for the current buffer. 
Normally, Emacs handles these settings intelligently, but it is
sometimes useful to have this information.

   <p><var>cs</var> describes the character set of the buffer (see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>).  If it is a dash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;), that indicates the default
state of affairs: no special character set handling, except for the
end-of-line translations described in the next paragraph.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo;
means no conversion whatsoever.  Letters represent various nontrivial
<dfn>coding systems</dfn>&mdash;for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; represents ISO Latin-1. 
On a text-only terminal, <var>cs</var> is preceded by two additional
characters that describe the coding system for keyboard input and the
coding system for terminal output.  Furthermore, if you are using an
input method, <var>cs</var> is preceded by a string that identifies the
input method, which takes the form &lsquo;<samp><var>i</var><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><var>i</var><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;<samp><var>i</var><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; (see <a href="Input-Methods.html#Input-Methods">Input Methods</a>).

   <p><a name="index-end_002dof_002dline-conversion_002c-mode_002dline-indication-14"></a>  The character after <var>cs</var> is usually a colon.  However, under
some circumstances a different string is displayed, which indicates a
nontrivial end-of-line convention.  Usually, lines of text are
separated by <dfn>newline characters</dfn>, but two other conventions are
sometimes used.  The MS-DOS convention is to use a &ldquo;carriage-return&rdquo;
character followed by a &ldquo;linefeed&rdquo; character; when editing such
files, the colon changes to either a backslash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;) or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(DOS)</span></samp>&rsquo;, depending on the operating system.  The Macintosh
end-of-line convention is to use a &ldquo;carriage-return&rdquo; character
instead of a newline; when editing such files, the colon indicator
changes to either a forward slash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;) or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(Mac)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  On some
systems, Emacs displays &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(Unix)</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of the colon for files
that use newline as the line separator.

   <p>The next element on the mode line is the string indicated by
<var>ch</var>.  This shows two dashes (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>&rsquo;) if the buffer displayed
in the window has the same contents as the corresponding file on the
disk; i.e., if the buffer is &ldquo;unmodified&rdquo;.  If the buffer is
modified, it shows two stars (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">**</span></samp>&rsquo;).  For a read-only buffer, it
shows &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%*</span></samp>&rsquo; if the buffer is modified, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo; otherwise.

   <p>The character after <var>ch</var> is normally a dash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
However, if the default-directory for the current buffer is on a
remote machine, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; is displayed instead (see <a href="File-Names.html#File-Names">File Names</a>).

   <p><var>fr</var> gives the selected frame name (see <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>).  It appears
only on text-only terminals.  The initial frame's name is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F1</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><var>buf</var> is the name of the buffer displayed in the window. 
Usually, this is the same as the name of a file you are editing. 
See <a href="Buffers.html#Buffers">Buffers</a>.

   <p><var>pos</var> tells you whether there is additional text above the top of
the window, or below the bottom.  If your buffer is small and it is all
visible in the window, <var>pos</var> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">All</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Otherwise, it is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo; if you are looking at the beginning of the buffer, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Bot</span></samp>&rsquo;
if you are looking at the end of the buffer, or &lsquo;<samp><var>nn</var><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;, where
<var>nn</var> is the percentage of the buffer above the top of the window. 
With Size Indication mode, you can display the size of the buffer as
well.  See <a href="Optional-Mode-Line.html#Optional-Mode-Line">Optional Mode Line</a>.

   <p><var>line</var> is the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by the line number at
point.  (You can display the current column number too, by turning on
Column Number mode.  See <a href="Optional-Mode-Line.html#Optional-Mode-Line">Optional Mode Line</a>.)

   <p><var>major</var> is the name of the <dfn>major mode</dfn> used in the buffer. 
A major mode is a principal editing mode for the buffer, such as Text
mode, Lisp mode, C mode, and so forth.  See <a href="Major-Modes.html#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>.

   <p>Some major modes display additional information after the major mode
name.  For example, Rmail buffers display the current message number and
the total number of messages.  Compilation buffers and Shell buffers
display the status of the subprocess.

   <p><var>minor</var> is a list of some of the <dfn>minor modes</dfn> turned on in
the buffer.  Minor modes are optional editing modes that provide
additional features on top of the major mode.  See <a href="Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>.

   <p>Some features are listed together with the minor modes whenever they
are turned on, even through they are not really minor modes. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Narrow</span></samp>&rsquo; means that the buffer being displayed has editing
restricted to only a portion of its text (see <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>). 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Def</span></samp>&rsquo; means that a keyboard macro is currently being defined
(see <a href="Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>).

   <p>In addition, if Emacs is inside a recursive editing level, square
brackets (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>&rsquo;) appear around the parentheses that
surround the modes.  If Emacs is in one recursive editing level within
another, double square brackets appear, and so on.  Since recursive
editing levels affect Emacs globally, not just one buffer, the square
brackets appear in every window's mode line or not in any of them. 
See <a href="Recursive-Edit.html#Recursive-Edit">Recursive Edit</a>.

   <p>You can change the appearance of the mode line as well as the format
of its contents.  See <a href="Optional-Mode-Line.html#Optional-Mode-Line">Optional Mode Line</a>.  In addition, the mode
line is mouse-sensitive; clicking on different parts of the mode line
performs various commands.  See <a href="Mode-Line-Mouse.html#Mode-Line-Mouse">Mode Line Mouse</a>.
