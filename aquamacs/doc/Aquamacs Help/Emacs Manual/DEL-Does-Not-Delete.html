<h3 class="section">59.1 If &lt;DEL&gt; Fails to Delete</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bDEL_007d-vs-_0040key_007bBACKSPACE_007d-4095"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bBACKSPACE_007d-vs-_0040key_007bDEL_007d-4096"></a><a name="index-usual-erasure-key-4097"></a>
  Every keyboard has a large key, usually labelled &lt;Backspace&gt;,
which is ordinarily used to erase the last character that you typed. 
We call this key <dfn>the usual erasure key</dfn>.  In Emacs, it is
supposed to be equivalent to &lt;DEL&gt;.

   <p>When Emacs starts up on a graphical display, it determines
automatically which key should be &lt;DEL&gt;.  In some unusual cases,
Emacs gets the wrong information from the system.  If the usual
erasure key deletes forwards instead of backwards, that is probably
what happened&mdash;Emacs ought to be treating the &lt;Backspace&gt; key as
&lt;DEL&gt;, but it isn't.

   <p>Some keyboards also have a &lt;Delete&gt; key, which is ordinarily
used to delete forwards.  If this key deletes backward in Emacs, that
too suggests Emacs got the wrong information&mdash;but in the opposite
sense.

   <p>On a text-only terminal, if you find the usual erasure key prompts
for a Help command, like <kbd>Control-h</kbd>, instead of deleting a
character, it means that key is actually sending the &lt;BS&gt;
character.  Emacs ought to be treating &lt;BS&gt; as &lt;DEL&gt;, but it
isn't.

   <p>In all of those cases, the immediate remedy is the same: use the
command <kbd>M-x normal-erase-is-backspace-mode</kbd>.  This toggles
between the two modes that Emacs supports for handling &lt;DEL&gt;, so
if Emacs starts in the wrong mode, this should switch to the right
mode.  On a text-only terminal, if you want to ask for help when
&lt;BS&gt; is treated as &lt;DEL&gt;, use &lt;F1&gt;; <kbd>C-?</kbd> may also
work, if it sends character code 127.

   <p><a name="index-normal_002derase_002dis_002dbackspace_002dmode-4098"></a>  To fix the problem automatically for every Emacs session, you can
put one of the following lines into your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file
(see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).  For the first case above, where &lt;Backspace&gt;
deletes forwards instead of backwards, use this line to make
&lt;Backspace&gt; act as &lt;DEL&gt; (resulting in behavior compatible
with Emacs 20 and previous versions):

<pre class="lisp">     (normal-erase-is-backspace-mode 0)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For the other two cases, use this line:

<pre class="lisp">     (normal-erase-is-backspace-mode 1)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-normal_002derase_002dis_002dbackspace-4099"></a>  Another way to fix the problem for every Emacs session is to
customize the variable <code>normal-erase-is-backspace</code>: the value
<code>t</code> specifies the mode where &lt;BS&gt; or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; is
&lt;DEL&gt;, and <code>nil</code> specifies the other mode.  See <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>.
