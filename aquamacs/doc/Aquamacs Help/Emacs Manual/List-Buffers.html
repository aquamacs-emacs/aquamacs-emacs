<h3 class="section">23.2 Listing Existing Buffers</h3>

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x C-b</kbd><dd>List the existing buffers (<code>list-buffers</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-listing-current-buffers-1072"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002db-1073"></a><a name="index-list_002dbuffers-1074"></a>  To display a list of existing buffers, type <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd>.  Each
line in the list shows one buffer's name, major mode and visited file. 
The buffers are listed in the order that they were current; the
buffers that were current most recently come first.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; in the first field of a line indicates that the buffer is
current.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates a read-only buffer.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates
that the buffer is &ldquo;modified.&rdquo;  If several buffers are modified, it
may be time to save some with <kbd>C-x s</kbd> (see <a href="Save-Commands.html#Save-Commands">Save Commands</a>). 
Here is an example of a buffer list:

<pre class="smallexample">     CRM Buffer                Size  Mode              File
     . * .emacs                3294  Emacs-Lisp        ~/.emacs
      %  *Help*                 101  Help
         search.c             86055  C                 ~/cvs/emacs/src/search.c
      %  src                  20959  Dired by name     ~/cvs/emacs/src/
       * *mail*                  42  Mail
      %  HELLO                 1607  Fundamental       ~/cvs/emacs/etc/HELLO
      %  NEWS                481184  Outline           ~/cvs/emacs/etc/NEWS
         *scratch*              191  Lisp Interaction
       * *Messages*            1554  Fundamental
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Help*</span></samp>&rsquo; was made by a help request (see <a href="Help.html#Help">Help</a>); it
is not visiting any file.  The buffer <code>src</code> was made by Dired on
the directory <samp><span class="file">~/cvs/emacs/src/</span></samp>.  You can list only buffers that
are visiting files by giving the command a prefix argument, as in
<kbd>C-u C-x C-b</kbd>.

   <p><code>list-buffers</code> omits buffers whose names begin with a space,
unless they visit files: such buffers are used internally by Emacs.
