<h4 class="subsection">19.1.6 Scrolling During Incremental Search</h4>

<p><a name="index-isearch_002dallow_002dscroll-658"></a>  You can enable the use of vertical scrolling during incremental
search (without exiting the search) by setting the customizable
variable <code>isearch-allow-scroll</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  This
applies to using the vertical scroll-bar and to certain keyboard
commands such as &lt;prior&gt; (<code>scroll-down</code>), &lt;next&gt;
(<code>scroll-up</code>) and <kbd>C-l</kbd> (<code>recenter</code>).  You must run
these commands via their key sequences to stay in the search&mdash;typing
<kbd>M-x</kbd> will terminate the search.  You can give prefix arguments to
these commands in the usual way.

   <p>This feature won't let you scroll the current match out of visibility,
however.

   <p>The feature also affects some other commands, such as <kbd>C-x 2</kbd>
(<code>split-window-vertically</code>) and <kbd>C-x ^</kbd>
(<code>enlarge-window</code>) which don't exactly scroll but do affect where
the text appears on the screen.  In general, it applies to any command
whose name has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>isearch-scroll</code> property.  So you
can control which commands are affected by changing these properties.

   <p>For example, to make <kbd>C-h l</kbd> usable within an incremental search
in all future Emacs sessions, use <kbd>C-h c</kbd> to find what command it
runs.  (You type <kbd>C-h c C-h l</kbd>; it says <code>view-lossage</code>.) 
Then you can put the following line in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file
(see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>):

<pre class="example">     (put 'view-lossage 'isearch-scroll t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This feature can be applied to any command that doesn't permanently
change point, the buffer contents, the match data, the current buffer,
or the selected window and frame.  The command must not itself attempt
an incremental search.
