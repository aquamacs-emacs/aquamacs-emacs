<h4 class="subsection">19.1.8 Slow Terminal Incremental Search</h4>

<p>Incremental search on a slow terminal uses a modified style of display
that is designed to take less time.  Instead of redisplaying the buffer at
each place the search gets to, it creates a new single-line window and uses
that to display the line that the search has found.  The single-line window
comes into play as soon as point moves outside of the text that is already
on the screen.

   <p>When you terminate the search, the single-line window is removed. 
Emacs then redisplays the window in which the search was done, to show
its new position of point.

   <p><a name="index-search_002dslow_002dspeed-660"></a>  The slow terminal style of display is used when the terminal baud rate is
less than or equal to the value of the variable <code>search-slow-speed</code>,
initially 1200.  See also the discussion of the variable <code>baud-rate</code>
(see <a href="baud_002drate.html#baud_002drate">Customization of Display</a>).

   <p><a name="index-search_002dslow_002dwindow_002dlines-661"></a>  The number of lines to use in slow terminal search display is controlled
by the variable <code>search-slow-window-lines</code>.  Its normal value is 1.
