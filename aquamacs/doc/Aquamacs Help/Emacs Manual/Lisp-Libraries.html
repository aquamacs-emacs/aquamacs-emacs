<h3 class="section">31.8 Libraries of Lisp Code for Emacs</h3>

<p><a name="index-libraries-2380"></a><a name="index-loading-Lisp-code-2381"></a>
  Lisp code for Emacs editing commands is stored in files whose names
conventionally end in <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp>.  This ending tells Emacs to edit them in
Emacs-Lisp mode (see <a href="Executing-Lisp.html#Executing-Lisp">Executing Lisp</a>).

   <p><a name="index-byte-code-2382"></a>  Emacs Lisp code can be compiled into byte-code, which loads faster,
takes up less space, and executes faster.  See <a href="../elisp/Byte-Compilation.html#Byte-Compilation">Byte Compilation</a>.  By
convention, the compiled code for a library goes in a separate file
whose name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.elc</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Thus, the compiled code for
<samp><span class="file">foo.el</span></samp> goes in <samp><span class="file">foo.elc</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-load_002dfile-2383"></a>  To execute a file of Emacs Lisp code, use <kbd>M-x load-file</kbd>.  This
command reads a file name using the minibuffer and then executes the
contents of that file as Lisp code.  It is not necessary to visit the
file first; in any case, this command reads the file as found on disk,
not text in an Emacs buffer.

   <p><a name="index-load-2384"></a><a name="index-load_002dlibrary-2385"></a>  Once a file of Lisp code is installed in the Emacs Lisp library
directories, users can load it using <kbd>M-x load-library</kbd>.  Programs
can load it by calling <code>load</code>, a more primitive function that is
similar but accepts some additional arguments.

   <p><kbd>M-x load-library</kbd> differs from <kbd>M-x load-file</kbd> in that it
searches a sequence of directories and tries three file names in each
directory.  Suppose your argument is <var>lib</var>; the three names are
<samp><var>lib</var><span class="file">.elc</span></samp>, <samp><var>lib</var><span class="file">.el</span></samp>, and lastly just
<samp><var>lib</var></samp>.  If <samp><var>lib</var><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> exists, it is by convention
the result of compiling <samp><var>lib</var><span class="file">.el</span></samp>; it is better to load the
compiled file, since it will load and run faster.

   <p>If <code>load-library</code> finds that <samp><var>lib</var><span class="file">.el</span></samp> is newer than
<samp><var>lib</var><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> file, it issues a warning, because it's likely
that somebody made changes to the <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> file and forgot to
recompile it.  Nonetheless, it loads <samp><var>lib</var><span class="file">.elc</span></samp>.  This is
because people often leave unfinished edits the source file, and don't
recompile it until they think it is ready to use.

   <p><a name="index-load_002dpath-2386"></a>  The variable <code>load-path</code> specifies the sequence of directories
searched by <kbd>M-x load-library</kbd>.  Its value should be a list of
strings that are directory names; in addition, <code>nil</code> in this list
stands for the current default directory.  (Generally, it is not a
good idea to put <code>nil</code> in the list; if you find yourself wishing
that <code>nil</code> were in the list, most likely what you really want is
to do <kbd>M-x load-file</kbd> this once.)

   <p>The default value of <code>load-path</code> is a list of directories where
the Lisp code for Emacs itself is stored.  If you have libraries of
your own, put them in a single directory and add that directory to
<code>load-path</code>, by adding a line like this to your init file
(see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>):

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/lisp/libraries")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-autoload-2387"></a>  Some commands are <dfn>autoloaded</dfn>: when you run them, Emacs will
automatically load the associated library first.  For instance, the
<code>compile</code> and <code>compilation-mode</code> commands
(see <a href="Compilation.html#Compilation">Compilation</a>) are autoloaded; if you call either command,
Emacs automatically loads the <code>compile</code> library.  In contrast,
the command <code>recompile</code> is not autoloaded, so it is unavailable
until you load the <code>compile</code> library.

   <p><a name="index-load_002ddangerous_002dlibraries-2388"></a><a name="index-Lisp-files-byte_002dcompiled-by-XEmacs-2389"></a>  By default, Emacs refuses to load compiled Lisp files which were
compiled with XEmacs, a modified versions of Emacs&mdash;they can cause
Emacs to crash.  Set the variable <code>load-dangerous-libraries</code> to
<code>t</code> if you want to try loading them.
