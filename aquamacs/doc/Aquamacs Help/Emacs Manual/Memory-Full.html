  If you get the error message &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Virtual memory exceeded</span></samp>&rsquo;, save
your modified buffers with <kbd>C-x s</kbd>.  This method of saving them
has the smallest need for additional memory.  Emacs keeps a reserve of
memory which it makes available when this error happens; that should
be enough to enable <kbd>C-x s</kbd> to complete its work.  When the
reserve has been used, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!MEM FULL!</span></samp>&rsquo; appears at the beginning of
the mode line, indicating there is no more reserve.

   <p>Once you have saved your modified buffers, you can exit this Emacs
session and start another, or you can use <kbd>M-x kill-some-buffers</kbd>
to free space in the current Emacs job.  If this frees up sufficient
space, Emacs will refill its memory reserve, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!MEM FULL!</span></samp>&rsquo;
will disappear from the mode line.  That means you can safely go on
editing in the same Emacs session.

   <p>Do not use <kbd>M-x buffer-menu</kbd> to save or kill buffers when you run
out of memory, because the buffer menu needs a fair amount of memory
itself, and the reserve supply may not be enough.
