<h2 class="chapter">4 Keys and Commands</h2>

<p><a name="index-binding-40"></a><a name="index-command-41"></a><a name="index-function-definition-42"></a>  This manual is full of passages that tell you what particular keys
do.  But Emacs does not assign meanings to keys directly.  Instead,
Emacs assigns meanings to named <dfn>commands</dfn>, and then gives keys
their meanings by <dfn>binding</dfn> them to commands.

   <p>Every command has a name chosen by a programmer.  The name is
usually made of a few English words separated by dashes; for example,
<code>next-line</code> or <code>forward-word</code>.  A command also has a
<dfn>function definition</dfn> which is a Lisp program; this is how the
command does its work.  In Emacs Lisp, a command is a Lisp function
with special properties that make it suitable for interactive use. 
For more information on commands and functions, see <a href="../elisp/What-Is-a-Function.html#What-Is-a-Function">What Is a Function</a>.

   <p>The bindings between keys and commands are recorded in tables called
<dfn>keymaps</dfn>.  See <a href="Keymaps.html#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>.

   <p>When we say that &ldquo;<kbd>C-n</kbd> moves down vertically one line&rdquo; we are
glossing over a subtle distinction that is irrelevant in ordinary use,
but vital for Emacs customization.  The command <code>next-line</code> does
a vertical move downward.  <kbd>C-n</kbd> has this effect <em>because</em> it
is bound to <code>next-line</code>.  If you rebind <kbd>C-n</kbd> to the command
<code>forward-word</code>, <kbd>C-n</kbd> will move forward one word instead.

   <p>In this manual, we will often speak of keys like <kbd>C-n</kbd> as
commands, even though strictly speaking the key is bound to a command. 
Usually we state the name of the command which really does the work in
parentheses after mentioning the key that runs it.  For example, we
will say that &ldquo;The command <kbd>C-n</kbd> (<code>next-line</code>) moves point
vertically down,&rdquo; meaning that the command <code>next-line</code> moves
vertically down, and the key <kbd>C-n</kbd> is normally bound to it.

   <p>Since we are discussing customization, we should tell you about
<dfn>variables</dfn>.  Often the description of a command will say, &ldquo;To
change this, set the variable <code>mumble-foo</code>.&rdquo;  A variable is a
name used to store a value.  Most of the variables documented in this
manual are meant for customization: some command or other part of
Emacs examines the variable and behaves differently according to the
value that you set.  You can ignore the information about variables
until you are interested in customizing them.  Then read the basic
information on variables (see <a href="Variables.html#Variables">Variables</a>) and the information about
specific variables will make sense.
