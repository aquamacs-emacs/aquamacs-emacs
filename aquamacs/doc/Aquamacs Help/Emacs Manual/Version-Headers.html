<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.10.3 Inserting Version Control Headers</h5>

<p>Sometimes it is convenient to put version identification strings
directly into working files.  Certain special strings called
<dfn>version headers</dfn> are replaced in each successive version by the
number of that version, the name of the user who created it, and other
relevant information.  All of the back ends that VC supports have such
a mechanism, except GNU Arch.

   <p>VC does not normally use the information contained in these headers. 
The exception is RCS&mdash;with RCS, version headers are sometimes more
reliable than the master file to determine which version of the file
you are editing.  Note that in a multi-branch environment, version
headers are necessary to make VC behave correctly
(see <a href="Multi_002dUser-Branching.html#Multi_002dUser-Branching">Multi-User Branching</a>).

   <p>Searching for RCS version headers is controlled by the variable
<code>vc-consult-headers</code>.  If it is non-<code>nil</code> (the default),
Emacs searches for headers to determine the version number you are
editing.  Setting it to <code>nil</code> disables this feature.

   <p>Note that although CVS uses the same kind of version headers as RCS
does, VC never searches for these headers if you are using CVS,
regardless of the above setting.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-h-2510"></a><a name="index-vc_002dinsert_002dheaders-2511"></a>  You can use the <kbd>C-x v h</kbd> command (<code>vc-insert-headers</code>) to
insert a suitable header string.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v h</kbd><dd>Insert headers in a file for use with your version-control system. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-vc_002d_0040var_007bbackend_007d_002dheader-2512"></a>  The default header string is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$<!-- /@w -->Id$</span></samp>&rsquo; for RCS and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%<!-- /@w -->W%</span></samp>&rsquo; for SCCS.  You can specify other headers to insert by
setting the variables <code>vc-</code><var>backend</var><code>-header</code> where
<var>backend</var> is <code>rcs</code> or <code>sccs</code>.

   <p>Instead of a single string, you can specify a list of strings; then
each string in the list is inserted as a separate header on a line of
its own.

   <p>It may be necessary to use apparently-superfluous backslashes when
writing the strings that you put in this variable.  For instance, you
might write <code>"$Id\$"</code> rather than <code>"$Id$<!-- /@w -->"</code>.  The extra
backslash prevents the string constant from being interpreted as a
header, if the Emacs Lisp file containing it is maintained with
version control.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dcomment_002dalist-2513"></a>  Each header is inserted surrounded by tabs, inside comment delimiters,
on a new line at point.  Normally the ordinary comment
start and comment end strings of the current mode are used, but for
certain modes, there are special comment delimiters for this purpose;
the variable <code>vc-comment-alist</code> specifies them.  Each element of
this list has the form <code>(</code><var>mode</var> <var>starter</var> <var>ender</var><code>)</code>.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dstatic_002dheader_002dalist-2514"></a>  The variable <code>vc-static-header-alist</code> specifies further strings
to add based on the name of the buffer.  Its value should be a list of
elements of the form <code>(</code><var>regexp</var><code> . </code><var>format</var><code>)</code>.  Whenever
<var>regexp</var> matches the buffer name, <var>format</var> is inserted as part
of the header.  A header line is inserted for each element that matches
the buffer name, and for each string specified by
<code>vc-</code><var>backend</var><code>-header</code>.  The header line is made by processing the
string from <code>vc-</code><var>backend</var><code>-header</code> with the format taken from the
element.  The default value for <code>vc-static-header-alist</code> is as follows:

<pre class="example">     (("\\.c$" .
       "\n#ifndef lint\nstatic char vcid[] = \"\%s\";\n\
     #endif /* lint */\n"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It specifies insertion of text of this form:

<pre class="example">     
     #ifndef lint
     static char vcid[] = "<var>string</var>";
     #endif /* lint */
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that the text above starts with a blank line.

   <p>If you use more than one version header in a file, put them close
together in the file.  The mechanism in <code>revert-buffer</code> that
preserves markers may not handle markers positioned between two version
headers.
