<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.7.1 Switching between Branches</h5>

<p>To switch between branches, type <kbd>C-u C-x v v</kbd> and specify the
revision ID you want to select.  On a locking-based system, this
version is then visited <em>unlocked</em> (write-protected), so you can
examine it before locking it.  Switching branches in this way is allowed
only when the file is not locked.

   <p>On a VCS with dot-pair IDs, you can omit the minor part, thus giving
only the branch ID; this takes you to the head version on the
chosen branch.  If you only type &lt;RET&gt;, Emacs goes to the highest
version on the trunk.

   <p>After you have switched to any branch (including the main branch), you
stay on it for subsequent VC commands, until you explicitly select some
other branch.
