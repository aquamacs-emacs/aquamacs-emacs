<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.5.1 Registering a File for Version Control</h5>

<p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-i-2462"></a><a name="index-vc_002dregister-2463"></a>  You can put any file under version control by simply visiting it, and
then typing <kbd>C-x&nbsp;v&nbsp;i</kbd><!-- /@w --> (<code>vc-register</code>).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v i</kbd><dd>Register the visited file for version control. 
</dl>

   <p>To register the file, Emacs must choose which version control system
to use for it.  If the file's directory already contains files
registered in a version control system, Emacs uses that system.  If
there is more than one system in use for a directory, Emacs uses the
one that appears first in <code>vc-handled-backends</code>
(see <a href="Customizing-VC.html#Customizing-VC">Customizing VC</a>). 
On the other hand, if there are no files already registered, Emacs uses
the first system from <code>vc-handled-backends</code> that could register
the file (for example, you cannot register a file under CVS if its
directory is not already part of a CVS tree); with the default value
of <code>vc-handled-backends</code>, this means that Emacs uses RCS in this
situation.

   <p>If locking is in use, <kbd>C-x v i</kbd> leaves the file unlocked and
read-only.  Type <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> if you wish to start editing it.  After
registering a file with CVS, you must subsequently commit the initial
revision by typing <kbd>C-x v v</kbd>.  Until you do that, the revision ID
appears as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@@</span></samp>&rsquo; in the mode line.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddefault_002dinit_002drevision-2464"></a><a name="index-initial-revision-ID-to-register-2465"></a>  The default initial revision ID for a newly registered file
varies by what VCS you are using; normally it will be 1.1 on VCSes
that use dot-pair revision IDs and 1 on VCSes that use monotonic IDs. 
You can specify a different default by setting the variable
<code>vc-default-init-revision</code>, or you can give <kbd>C-x v i</kbd> a
numeric argument; then it reads the initial revision ID for this
particular file using the minibuffer.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dinitial_002dcomment-2466"></a>  If <code>vc-initial-comment</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, <kbd>C-x v i</kbd> reads an
initial comment to describe the purpose of this source file.  Reading
the initial comment works like reading a log entry (see <a href="Log-Buffer.html#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>).
