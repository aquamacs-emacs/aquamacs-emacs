<h2 class="chapter">20 Commands for Fixing Typos</h2>

<p><a name="index-typos_002c-fixing-712"></a><a name="index-mistakes_002c-correcting-713"></a>
  In this chapter we describe the commands that are especially useful
when you catch a mistake in your text after you have made it, or
change your mind while composing text on the fly.

   <p>The most fundamental command for correcting erroneous editing is the
undo command <kbd>C-/</kbd> (which is also bound to <kbd>C-x u</kbd> and
<kbd>C-_</kbd>).  This undoes a single command, or a part of a command (as
in the case of <code>query-replace</code>), or several consecutive
self-inserting characters.  Consecutive repetitions of <kbd>C-/</kbd> undo
earlier and earlier changes, back to the limit of the undo information
available.

   <p>Aside from the commands described here, you can erase text using
deletion commands such as &lt;DEL&gt; (<code>delete-backward-char</code>). 
These were described earlier in this manual.  See <a href="Erasing.html#Erasing">Erasing</a>.
