<h4 class="subsection">8.3.2 Completion Commands</h4>

<p>Here is a list of the completion commands defined in the minibuffer
when completion is allowed.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-minibuffer_002dcomplete-166"></a>Complete the text in the minibuffer as much as possible; if unable to
complete, display a list of possible completions
(<code>minibuffer-complete</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Complete up to one word from the minibuffer text before point
(<code>minibuffer-complete-word</code>).  &lt;SPC&gt; for completion is not
available when entering a file name, since file names often include
spaces. 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Submit the text in the minibuffer as the argument, possibly completing
first as described in the next
node (<code>minibuffer-complete-and-exit</code>).  See <a href="Strict-Completion.html#Strict-Completion">Strict Completion</a>. 
<br><dt><kbd>?</kbd><dd>Display a list of possible completions of the text before point
(<code>minibuffer-completion-help</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-TAB-167"></a><a name="index-minibuffer_002dcomplete-168"></a>  &lt;TAB&gt; (<code>minibuffer-complete</code>) is the most fundamental
completion command.  It searches for all possible completion
alternatives that match the existing minibuffer text, and attempts to
complete as much as it can.  The matching of completion alternatives
to the minibuffer text is performed according to somewhat intricate
rules, which are designed so that plausible completions are offered
under most circumstances.  A valid completion alternative must satisfy
the following criteria:

     <ul>
<li>The minibuffer text before point must be the same as the beginning of
the completion alternative.  If there is any minibuffer text after
point, it must be a substring of the remainder of the completion
alternative.

     <li>If no completion alternative satisfies the above rules, try using
<dfn>partial completion</dfn> rules: divide the minibuffer text into words
separated by hyphens or spaces, and complete each word separately. 
Thus, when completing command names, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">em-l-m</span></samp>&rsquo; completes to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emacs-lisp-mode</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>If there is still no completion alternative, try the first rule again,
but ignore the minibuffer text after point (i.e., don't try matching
it). 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">When performing these comparisons, a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; in the minibuffer text
acts as a <dfn>wildcard</dfn>&mdash;it matches any character at the
corresponding position in the completion alternative.

   <p><a name="index-SPC-169"></a><a name="index-minibuffer_002dcomplete_002dword-170"></a>  &lt;SPC&gt; (<code>minibuffer-complete-word</code>) completes like
&lt;TAB&gt;, but only up to the next hyphen or space.  If you have
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto-f</span></samp>&rsquo; in the minibuffer and type &lt;SPC&gt;, it finds that the
completion is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto-fill-mode</span></samp>&rsquo;, but it only inserts &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ill-</span></samp>&rsquo;,
giving &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto-fill-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Another &lt;SPC&gt; at this point completes
all the way to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auto-fill-mode</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If &lt;TAB&gt; or &lt;SPC&gt; is unable to complete, it displays a list
of possible completions (if there are any) in a separate window.  You
can choose a completion from this list using the following commands:

     
<a name="index-mouse_002dchoose_002dcompletion-171"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>Mouse-1</kbd><dt><kbd>Mouse-2</kbd><dd>Clicking mouse button 1 or 2 on a completion possibility chooses that
completion (<code>mouse-choose-completion</code>).

     <p><a name="index-switch_002dto_002dcompletions-172"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-v</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;PageUp&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;prior&gt;</kbd><dd>Typing <kbd>M-v</kbd>, while in the minibuffer, selects the window showing
the completion list buffer (<code>switch-to-completions</code>).  This paves
the way for using the commands below.  Typing &lt;PageUp&gt; or
&lt;prior&gt; does the same, as does selecting that window in other
ways.

     <p><a name="index-choose_002dcompletion-173"></a><br><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Typing &lt;RET&gt;, while in the completion list buffer, chooses the
completion that point is in or next to (<code>choose-completion</code>).  To
use this command, you must first switch to the completion list window.

     <p><a name="index-next_002dcompletion-174"></a><br><dt><kbd>&lt;Right&gt;</kbd><dd>Typing the right-arrow key &lt;Right&gt;, while in the completion list
buffer, moves point to the following completion possibility
(<code>next-completion</code>).

     <p><a name="index-previous_002dcompletion-175"></a><br><dt><kbd>&lt;Left&gt;</kbd><dd>Typing the left-arrow key &lt;Left&gt;, while in the completion list
buffer, moves point to the previous completion possibility
(<code>previous-completion</code>).
