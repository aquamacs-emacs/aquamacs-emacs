<h3 class="section">36.4 Deleting Messages</h3>

<p><a name="index-deletion-_0028Rmail_0029-2814"></a>  When you no longer need to keep a message, you can <dfn>delete</dfn> it.  This
flags it as ignorable, and some Rmail commands pretend it is no longer
present; but it still has its place in the Rmail file, and still has its
message number.

   <p><a name="index-expunging-_0028Rmail_0029-2815"></a>  <dfn>Expunging</dfn> the Rmail file actually removes the deleted messages. 
The remaining messages are renumbered consecutively. 
<!-- The following is neither true (there is also unforward, sorting, -->
<!-- etc), nor especially interesting. -->
<!-- Expunging is the only action that changes the message number of any -->
<!-- message, except for undigestifying (@pxref{Rmail Digest}). -->

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Delete the current message, and move to the next nondeleted message
(<code>rmail-delete-forward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-d</kbd><dd>Delete the current message, and move to the previous nondeleted
message (<code>rmail-delete-backward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Undelete the current message, or move back to the previous deleted
message and undelete it (<code>rmail-undelete-previous-message</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd>Expunge the Rmail file (<code>rmail-expunge</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-d-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-2816"></a><a name="index-C_002dd-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-2817"></a><a name="index-rmail_002ddelete_002dforward-2818"></a><a name="index-rmail_002ddelete_002dbackward-2819"></a>  There are two Rmail commands for deleting messages.  Both delete the
current message and select another message.  <kbd>d</kbd>
(<code>rmail-delete-forward</code>) moves to the following message, skipping
messages already deleted, while <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>rmail-delete-backward</code>)
moves to the previous nondeleted message.  If there is no nondeleted
message to move to in the specified direction, the message that was just
deleted remains current.  <kbd>d</kbd> with a prefix argument is equivalent
to <kbd>C-d</kbd>.  Note that the Rmail summary versions of these commands
behave slightly differently (see <a href="Rmail-Summary-Edit.html#Rmail-Summary-Edit">Rmail Summary Edit</a>).

<!-- mention other hooks, eg show message hook? -->
   <p><a name="index-rmail_002ddelete_002dmessage_002dhook-2820"></a>  Whenever Rmail deletes a message, it runs the hook
<code>rmail-delete-message-hook</code>.  When the hook functions are invoked,
the message has been marked deleted, but it is still the current message
in the Rmail buffer.

   <p><a name="index-undeletion-_0028Rmail_0029-2821"></a><a name="index-x-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-2822"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dexpunge-2823"></a><a name="index-u-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-2824"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dundelete_002dprevious_002dmessage-2825"></a>  To make all the deleted messages finally vanish from the Rmail file,
type <kbd>x</kbd> (<code>rmail-expunge</code>).  Until you do this, you can still
<dfn>undelete</dfn> the deleted messages.  The undeletion command, <kbd>u</kbd>
(<code>rmail-undelete-previous-message</code>), is designed to cancel the
effect of a <kbd>d</kbd> command in most cases.  It undeletes the current
message if the current message is deleted.  Otherwise it moves backward
to previous messages until a deleted message is found, and undeletes
that message.

   <p>You can usually undo a <kbd>d</kbd> with a <kbd>u</kbd> because the <kbd>u</kbd>
moves back to and undeletes the message that the <kbd>d</kbd> deleted.  But
this does not work when the <kbd>d</kbd> skips a few already-deleted messages
that follow the message being deleted; then the <kbd>u</kbd> command
undeletes the last of the messages that were skipped.  There is no clean
way to avoid this problem.  However, by repeating the <kbd>u</kbd> command,
you can eventually get back to the message that you intend to
undelete.  You can also select a particular deleted message with
the <kbd>M-p</kbd> command, then type <kbd>u</kbd> to undelete it.

   <p>A deleted message has the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">deleted</span></samp>&rsquo; attribute, and as a result
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">deleted</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in the mode line when the current message is
deleted.  In fact, deleting or undeleting a message is nothing more than
adding or removing this attribute.  See <a href="Rmail-Attributes.html#Rmail-Attributes">Rmail Attributes</a>.
