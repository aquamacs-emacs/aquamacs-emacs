<h3 class="section">59.2 Recursive Editing Levels</h3>

<p>Recursive editing levels are important and useful features of Emacs, but
they can seem like malfunctions if you do not understand them.

   <p>If the mode line has square brackets &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>&rsquo; around the parentheses
that contain the names of the major and minor modes, you have entered a
recursive editing level.  If you did not do this on purpose, or if you
don't understand what that means, you should just get out of the recursive
editing level.  To do so, type <kbd>M-x top-level</kbd>.  This is called getting
back to top level.  See <a href="Recursive-Edit.html#Recursive-Edit">Recursive Edit</a>.
