<h3 class="section">60.3 Understanding Bug Reporting</h3>

<p><a name="index-emacs_002dversion-4106"></a>  When you decide that there is a bug, it is important to report it and to
report it in a way which is useful.  What is most useful is an exact
description of what commands you type, starting with the shell command to
run Emacs, until the problem happens.

   <p>The most important principle in reporting a bug is to report
<em>facts</em>.  Hypotheses and verbal descriptions are no substitute for
the detailed raw data.  Reporting the facts is straightforward, but many
people strain to posit explanations and report them instead of the
facts.  If the explanations are based on guesses about how Emacs is
implemented, they will be useless; meanwhile, lacking the facts, we will
have no real information about the bug.

   <p>For example, suppose that you type <kbd>C-x C-f /glorp/baz.ugh
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, visiting a file which (you know) happens to be rather
large, and Emacs displays &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">I feel pretty today</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The best way to
report the bug is with a sentence like the preceding one, because it
gives all the facts.

   <p>A bad way would be to assume that the problem is due to the size of
the file and say, &ldquo;I visited a large file, and Emacs displayed &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">I
feel pretty today</span></samp>&rsquo;.&rdquo;  This is what we mean by &ldquo;guessing
explanations.&rdquo;  The problem is just as likely to be due to the fact
that there is a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo; in the file name.  If this is so, then when we
got your report, we would try out the problem with some &ldquo;large file,&rdquo;
probably with no &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo; in its name, and not see any problem.  There
is no way in the world that we could guess that we should try visiting a
file with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">z</span></samp>&rsquo; in its name.

   <p>Alternatively, the problem might be due to the fact that the file starts
with exactly 25 spaces.  For this reason, you should make sure that you
inform us of the exact contents of any file that is needed to reproduce the
bug.  What if the problem only occurs when you have typed the <kbd>C-x C-a</kbd>
command previously?  This is why we ask you to give the exact sequence of
characters you typed since starting the Emacs session.

   <p>You should not even say &ldquo;visit a file&rdquo; instead of <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> unless
you <em>know</em> that it makes no difference which visiting command is used. 
Similarly, rather than saying &ldquo;if I have three characters on the line,&rdquo;
say &ldquo;after I type <kbd>&lt;RET&gt; A B C &lt;RET&gt; C-p</kbd>,&rdquo; if that is
the way you entered the text.

   <p>So please don't guess any explanations when you report a bug.  If you
want to actually <em>debug</em> the problem, and report explanations that
are more than guesses, that is useful&mdash;but please include the facts as
well.
