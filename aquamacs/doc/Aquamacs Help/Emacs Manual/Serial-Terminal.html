  If you have a device connected to a serial port of your computer,
you can use Emacs to communicate with it.  <kbd>M-x serial-term</kbd> will
ask you for a serial port name and speed and will then open a new
window in <a href="Term-Mode.html#Term-Mode">Term Mode</a>.

   <p>The speed of the serial port is measured in bits per second.  The
most common speed is 9600 bits per second.  You can change the speed
interactively by clicking on the mode line.

   <p>A serial port can be configured even more by clicking on &ldquo;8N1&rdquo; in
the mode line.  By default, a serial port is configured as &ldquo;8N1&rdquo;,
which means that each byte consists of 8 data bits, No parity check
bit, and 1 stopbit.

   <p>When you have opened the serial port connection, you will see output
from the device in the window.  Also, what you type in the window is
sent to the device.

   <p>If the speed or the configuration is wrong, you cannot communicate
with your device and will probably only see garbage output in the
window.
