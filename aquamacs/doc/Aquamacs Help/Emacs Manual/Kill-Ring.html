<h3 class="section">13.1 The Kill Ring</h3>

<p>All killed text is recorded in the <dfn>kill ring</dfn>, a list of blocks
of text that have been killed.  There is only one kill ring, shared by
all buffers, so you can kill text in one buffer and yank it in another
buffer.  This is the usual way to move text from one file to another. 
(There are several other methods: for instance, you could store the
text in a register.  See <a href="Registers.html#Registers">Registers</a>, for information about
registers.  See <a href="Accumulating-Text.html#Accumulating-Text">Accumulating Text</a>, for some other ways to move text
around.)

   <p><a name="index-C_002dy-362"></a><a name="index-yank-363"></a>  The command <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>yank</code>) reinserts the text of the most
recent kill, leaving the cursor at the end of the text.  It also adds
the position of the beginning of the text to the mark ring, without
activating the mark; this allows you to jump easily to that position
with <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> (see <a href="Setting-Mark.html#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>).  With a plain prefix
argument (<kbd>C-u C-y</kbd>), it instead leaves the cursor in front of the
text, and adds the position of the end of the text to the mark ring. 
Using other sort of prefix argument specifies an earlier kill; for
example, <kbd>C-u 4 C-y</kbd> reinserts the fourth most recent kill. 
See <a href="Earlier-Kills.html#Earlier-Kills">Earlier Kills</a>.

   <p><a name="index-yanking-and-text-properties-364"></a><a name="index-yank_002dexcluded_002dproperties-365"></a>  The yank commands discard certain properties from the yanked text. 
These are properties that might lead to annoying results, such as
causing the text to respond to the mouse or specifying key bindings. 
The list of properties to discard is stored in the variable
<code>yank-excluded-properties</code>.  Yanking of register contents and
rectangles also discard these properties.  See <a href="../elisp/Text-Properties.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>, for more information about
text properties.
