<h3 class="section">28.1 Indentation Commands and Techniques</h3>

<p><a name="index-M_002dm-1502"></a><a name="index-back_002dto_002dindentation-1503"></a>  To move over the indentation on a line, do <kbd>M-m</kbd>
(<code>back-to-indentation</code>).  This command, given anywhere on a line,
positions point at the first nonblank character on the line, if any,
or else at the end of the line.

   <p>To insert an indented line before the current line, do <kbd>C-a C-o
&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.  To make an indented line after the current line, use
<kbd>C-e C-j</kbd>.

   <p>If you just want to insert a tab character in the buffer, type
<kbd>C-q &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002do-1504"></a><a name="index-split_002dline-1505"></a>  <kbd>C-M-o</kbd> (<code>split-line</code>) moves the text from point to the end of
the line vertically down, so that the current line becomes two lines. 
<kbd>C-M-o</kbd> first moves point forward over any spaces and tabs.  Then it
inserts after point a newline and enough indentation to reach the same
column point is on.  Point remains before the inserted newline; in this
regard, <kbd>C-M-o</kbd> resembles <kbd>C-o</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_005e-1506"></a><a name="index-delete_002dindentation-1507"></a>  To join two lines cleanly, use the <kbd>M-^</kbd>
(<code>delete-indentation</code>) command.  It deletes the indentation at
the front of the current line, and the line boundary as well,
replacing them with a single space.  As a special case (useful for
Lisp code) the single space is omitted if the characters to be joined
are consecutive open parentheses or closing parentheses, or if the
junction follows another newline.  To delete just the indentation of a
line, go to the beginning of the line and use <kbd>M-\</kbd>
(<code>delete-horizontal-space</code>), which deletes all spaces and tabs
around the cursor.

   <p>If you have a fill prefix, <kbd>M-^</kbd> deletes the fill prefix if it
appears after the newline that is deleted.  See <a href="Fill-Prefix.html#Fill-Prefix">Fill Prefix</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002d_005c-1508"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-TAB-1509"></a><a name="index-indent_002dregion-1510"></a><a name="index-indent_002drigidly-1511"></a>  There are also commands for changing the indentation of several lines
at once.  They apply to all the lines that begin in the region. 
<kbd>C-M-\</kbd> (<code>indent-region</code>) indents each line in the &ldquo;usual&rdquo;
way, as if you had typed &lt;TAB&gt; at the beginning of the line.  A
numeric argument specifies the column to indent to, and each line is
shifted left or right so that its first nonblank character appears in
that column.  <kbd>C-x &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (<code>indent-rigidly</code>) moves all of
the lines in the region right by its argument (left, for negative
arguments).  The whole group of lines moves rigidly sideways, which is
how the command gets its name.

   <p><a name="index-remove-indentation-1512"></a>  To remove all indentation from all of the lines in the region,
invoke <kbd>C-x &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> with a large negative argument, such as
-1000.

   <p><a name="index-indent_002drelative-1513"></a>  <kbd>M-x indent-relative</kbd> indents at point based on the previous line
(actually, the last nonempty line).  It inserts whitespace at point, moving
point, until it is underneath the next indentation point in the previous line. 
An indentation point is the end of a sequence of whitespace or the end of
the line.  If point is farther right than any indentation point in the
previous line, <code>indent-relative</code> runs <code>tab-to-tab-stop</code>
(see <a href="Tab-Stops.html#Tab-Stops">Tab Stops</a>),
unless it is called with a numeric argument, in which case it does
nothing.

   <p>See <a href="Format-Indentation.html#Format-Indentation">Format Indentation</a>, for another way of specifying the
indentation for part of your text.
