<h4 class="subsection">25.1.3 Cut and Paste with Other Window Applications</h4>

<p><a name="index-X-cutting-and-pasting-1186"></a><a name="index-X-selection-1187"></a><a name="index-primary-selection-1188"></a><a name="index-selection_002c-primary-1189"></a>  When running Emacs under the X window system, you can easily
transfer text between Emacs and other X applications using the
<dfn>primary selection</dfn> (also called the <dfn>X selection</dfn>).  This is
<em>not</em> the same thing as the <dfn>clipboard</dfn>, which is a separate
facility used on desktop environments such as Gnome, and on operating
systems such as Microsoft Windows (see <a href="Clipboard.html#Clipboard">Clipboard</a>).

   <p>Under X, whenever you select some text in Emacs by dragging or
clicking the mouse (see <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>), it is also saved in the
primary selection.  You can then <dfn>paste</dfn> that text into any other
X application, usually by clicking <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> in that application. 
Unlike the Emacs kill ring (see <a href="Kill-Ring.html#Kill-Ring">Kill Ring</a>), the primary selection
has no &ldquo;memory&rdquo;: each time you save something in the primary
selection, either in Emacs or in another X application, the previous
contents of the primary selection are lost.

   <p>Whenever you kill some text using a command such as <kbd>C-w</kbd>
(<code>kill-region</code>), or copy it into the kill ring using a command
such as <kbd>M-w</kbd> (<code>kill-ring-save</code>), that text is also saved in
the primary selection.  See <a href="Killing.html#Killing">Killing</a>.

   <p><a name="index-select_002dactive_002dregions-1190"></a>  If you set the region using the keyboard&mdash;for instance, by typing
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> and moving point away from the mark&mdash;the text in
the region is not normally saved to the primary selection.  However,
if you change the variable <code>select-active-regions</code> to <code>t</code>,
the region is saved to the primary selection whenever you activate the
mark.  Each change to the region also updates the primary selection.

   <p><a name="index-yank_002dpop_002dchange_002dselection-1191"></a>  If you change <code>yank-pop-change-selection</code> to <code>t</code>, rotating
the kill ring with <kbd>M-y</kbd> (<code>yank-pop</code>) also saves the new yank
to the primary selection (see <a href="Yanking.html#Yanking">Yanking</a>).

   <p><a name="index-save_002dinterprogram_002dpaste_002dbefore_002dkill-1192"></a>  If you change <code>save-interprogram-paste-before-kill</code> to
<code>t</code>, each kill command first saves the existing selection onto
the kill ring.  This prevents you from losing the existing selection,
at the risk of large memory consumption if other applications generate
large selections.

   <p><a name="index-cut-buffer-1193"></a><a name="index-x_002dcut_002dbuffer_002dmax-1194"></a>  Whenever Emacs saves some text to the primary selection, it may also
save it to the <dfn>cut buffer</dfn>.  The cut buffer is an obsolete
predecessor to the primary selection; most modern applications do not
use it.  Saving text to the cut buffer is slow and inefficient, so
Emacs only does it if the text is shorter than the value of
<code>x-cut-buffer-max</code> (20000 characters by default).

   <p>You can yank the primary selection into Emacs using the usual yank
commands, such as <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>yank</code>) and <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd>
(<code>mouse-yank-at-click</code>).  These commands actually check the
primary selection before referring to the kill ring; if no primary
selection is available, the kill ring contents are used.  To prevent
yank commands from accessing the primary selection, set the variable
<code>x-select-enable-primary</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>The standard coding system for the primary selection is
<code>compound-text-with-extensions</code>.  You may find that the pasted
text is not what you expected.  In such a case, you can specify
another coding system for the selection by typing <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt;
x</kbd> or <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; X</kbd>.  Alternatively, you can request a
different data type by modifying the variable
<code>x-select-request-type</code>.  See <a href="Communication-Coding.html#Communication-Coding">Communication Coding</a>.
