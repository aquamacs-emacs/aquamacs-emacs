<h4 class="subsection">G.11.4 File Names on MS-DOS</h4>

<p><a name="index-file-names-under-MS_002dDOS-4433"></a><a name="index-init-file_002c-default-name-under-MS_002dDOS-4434"></a>
  On MS-DOS, file names are case-insensitive and limited to eight
characters, plus optionally a period and three more characters.  Emacs
knows enough about these limitations to handle file names that were
meant for other operating systems.  For instance, leading dots
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;  in file names are invalid in MS-DOS, so Emacs transparently
converts them to underscores &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo;; thus your default init file
(see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>)
is called <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp> on MS-DOS.  Excess characters before or after
the period are generally ignored by MS-DOS itself; thus, if you visit
the file <samp><span class="file">LongFileName.EvenLongerExtension</span></samp>, you will silently
get <samp><span class="file">longfile.eve</span></samp>, but Emacs will still display the long file
name on the mode line.  Other than that, it's up to you to specify
file names which are valid under MS-DOS; the transparent conversion as
described above only works on file names built into Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-backup-file-names-on-MS_002dDOS-4435"></a>  The above restrictions on the file names on MS-DOS make it almost
impossible to construct the name of a backup file
(see <a href="Backup-Names.html#Backup-Names">Backup Names</a>)
without losing some of the original file name characters.  For
example, the name of a backup file for <samp><span class="file">docs.txt</span></samp> is
<samp><span class="file">docs.tx~</span></samp> even if single backup is used.

   <p><a name="index-file-names-under-Windows-95_002fNT-4436"></a><a name="index-long-file-names-in-DOS-box-under-Windows-95_002fNT-4437"></a>  If you run Emacs as a DOS application under Windows 9X, Windows ME, or
Windows 2000/XP, you can turn on support for long file names.  If you do
that, Emacs doesn't truncate file names or convert them to lower case;
instead, it uses the file names that you specify, verbatim.  To enable
long file name support, set the environment variable <samp><span class="env">LFN</span></samp> to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>&rsquo; before starting Emacs.  Unfortunately, Windows NT doesn't allow
DOS programs to access long file names, so Emacs built for MS-DOS will
only see their short 8+3 aliases.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bHOME_007d-directory-under-MS_002dDOS-4438"></a>  MS-DOS has no notion of home directory, so Emacs on MS-DOS pretends
that the directory where it is installed is the value of the <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp>
environment variable.  That is, if your Emacs binary,
<samp><span class="file">emacs.exe</span></samp>, is in the directory <samp><span class="file">c:/utils/emacs/bin</span></samp>, then
Emacs acts as if <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> were set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c:/utils/emacs</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In
particular, that is where Emacs looks for the init file <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp>. 
With this in mind, you can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; in file names as an alias for
the home directory, as you would on GNU or Unix.  You can also set
<samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> variable in the environment before starting Emacs; its
value will then override the above default behavior.

   <p>Emacs on MS-DOS handles the directory name <samp><span class="file">/dev</span></samp> specially,
because of a feature in the emulator libraries of DJGPP that pretends
I/O devices have names in that directory.  We recommend that you avoid
using an actual directory named <samp><span class="file">/dev</span></samp> on any disk.
