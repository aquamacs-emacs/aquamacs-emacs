<h4 class="subsection">57.3.5 Per-Directory Local Variables</h4>

<p><a name="index-local-variables_002c-for-all-files-in-a-directory-4009"></a><a name="index-directory-local-variables-4010"></a><a name="index-per_002ddirectory-local-variables-4011"></a>
  A <dfn>project</dfn> is a collection of files on which you work together. 
Usually, the project's files are kept in one or more directories. 
Occasionally, you may wish to define Emacs settings that are common to
all the files that belong to the project.

   <p>Emacs provides two ways to specify settings that are applicable to
files in a specific directory: you can put a special file in that
directory, or you can define a <dfn>project class</dfn> for that directory.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002edir_002dlocals_002eel_007d-file-4012"></a>  If you put a file with a special name <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> in a directory, Emacs will read it when it visits any file in that
directory or any of its subdirectories, and apply the settings it
specifies to the file's buffer.  Emacs searches for
<samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> starting in the directory of the visited file,
and moving up the directory tree.  (To avoid slowdown, this search is
skipped for remote files.)

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> file should hold a specially-constructed
list.  This list maps Emacs mode names (symbols) to alists; each alist
specifies values for variables to use when the respective mode is
turned on.  The special mode name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nil</span></samp>&rsquo; means that its alist
applies to any mode.  Instead of a mode name, you can specify a string
that is a name of a subdirectory of the project's directory; then the
corresponding alist applies to all the files in that subdirectory.

   <p>Here's an example of a <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     ((nil . ((indent-tabs-mode . t)
              (tab-width . 4)
              (fill-column . 80)))
      (c-mode . ((c-file-style . "BSD")))
      (java-mode . ((c-file-style . "BSD")))
      ("src/imported"
       . ((nil . ((change-log-default-name . "ChangeLog.local"))))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This example shows some settings for a hypothetical project.  It sets
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">indent-tabs-mode</span></samp>&rsquo;, <code>tab-width</code>, and <code>fill-column</code> for
any file in the project's directory tree, and it sets the indentation
style for any C or Java source file.  Finally, it specifies a different
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file name for any file in the <samp><span class="file">src/imported</span></samp>
subdirectory of the directory where you put the <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp>
file.

   <p><a name="index-add_002ddir_002dlocal_002dvariable-4013"></a><a name="index-delete_002ddir_002dlocal_002dvariable-4014"></a><a name="index-copy_002dfile_002dlocals_002dto_002ddir_002dlocals-4015"></a>  You can edit the <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> file by hand, or use the
command <code>add-dir-local-variable</code>.  This prompts for a mode (or
subdirectory), variable and value, and adds an entry to the file. 
The command <code>delete-dir-local-variable</code> deletes an entry.  The
command <code>copy-file-locals-to-dir-locals</code> copies file local
variables (see <a href="File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>) to the <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> file.

   <p><a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002dset_002dclass_002dvariables-4016"></a><a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002dset_002ddirectory_002dclass-4017"></a>  Another method of specifying directory-local variables is to explicitly
define a project class using <code>dir-locals-set-class-variables</code>, and
then tell Emacs which directories correspond to that class, using
<code>dir-locals-set-directory-class</code>.  You can put calls to these functions
in your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> init file; this can be useful when you can't put
<samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> in the directory for some reason, or if you want
to keep in a single place settings for several directories that don't
have a common parent.  For example, you could apply settings to an
unwritable directory this way:

<pre class="example">     (dir-locals-set-class-variables 'unwritable-directory
        '((nil . ((some-useful-setting . value)))))
     
     (dir-locals-set-directory-class
        "/usr/include/" 'unwritable-directory)
</pre>
   <p>Unsafe directory-local variables are handled in the same way as
unsafe file-local variables (see <a href="Safe-File-Variables.html#Safe-File-Variables">Safe File Variables</a>).

On MS-DOS, the name of this file should be <samp><span class="file">_dir-locals.el</span></samp>, due
to limitations of the DOS filesystems.  If the filesystem is limited
to 8+3 file names, the name of the file will be truncated by the OS to
<samp><span class="file">_dir-loc.el</span></samp>.
