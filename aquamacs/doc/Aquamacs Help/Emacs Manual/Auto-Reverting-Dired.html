<h4 class="subsection">22.5.2 Auto Reverting Dired buffers</h4>

<p>Auto-reverting Dired buffers currently works on GNU or Unix style
operating systems.  It may not work satisfactorily on some other
systems.

   <p>Dired buffers only auto-revert when the file list of the buffer's main
directory changes (e.g. when a new file is added).  They do not
auto-revert when information about a particular file changes
(e.g. when the size changes) or when inserted subdirectories change. 
To be sure that <em>all</em> listed information is up to date, you have
to manually revert using <kbd>g</kbd>, <em>even</em> if auto-reverting is
enabled in the Dired buffer.  Sometimes, you might get the impression
that modifying or saving files listed in the main directory actually
does cause auto-reverting.  This is because making changes to a file,
or saving it, very often causes changes in the directory itself; for
instance, through backup files or auto-save files.  However, this is
not guaranteed.

   <p>If the Dired buffer is marked modified and there are no changes you
want to protect, then most of the time you can make auto-reverting
resume by manually reverting the buffer using <kbd>g</kbd>.  There is one
exception.  If you flag or mark files, you can safely revert the
buffer.  This will not erase the flags or marks (unless the marked
file has been deleted, of course).  However, the buffer will stay
modified, even after reverting, and auto-reverting will not resume. 
This is because, if you flag or mark files, you may be working on the
buffer and you might not want the buffer to change without warning. 
If you want auto-reverting to resume in the presence of marks and
flags, mark the buffer non-modified using <kbd>M-~</kbd>.  However, adding,
deleting or changing marks or flags will mark it modified again.

   <p>Remote Dired buffers are not auto-reverted (because it may be slow). 
Neither are Dired buffers for which you used shell wildcards or file
arguments to list only some of the files.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Find*</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Locate*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffers do not auto-revert either.
