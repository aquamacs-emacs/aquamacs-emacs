<h5 class="subsubsection">57.3.4.2 Safety of File Variables</h5>

<p>File-local variables can be dangerous; when you visit someone else's
file, there's no telling what its local variables list could do to
your Emacs.  Improper values of the <code>eval</code> &ldquo;variable&rdquo;, and
other variables such as <code>load-path</code>, could execute Lisp code you
didn't intend to run.

   <p>Therefore, whenever Emacs encounters file local variable values that
are not known to be safe, it displays the file's entire local
variables list, and asks you for confirmation before setting them. 
You can type <kbd>y</kbd> or &lt;SPC&gt; to put the local variables list into
effect, or <kbd>n</kbd> to ignore it.  When Emacs is run in batch mode
(see <a href="Initial-Options.html#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>), it can't really ask you, so it assumes the
answer <kbd>n</kbd>.

   <p>Emacs normally recognizes certain variable/value pairs as safe. 
For instance, it is safe to give <code>comment-column</code> or
<code>fill-column</code> any integer value.  If a file specifies only
known-safe variable/value pairs, Emacs does not ask for confirmation
before setting them.  Otherwise, you can tell Emacs to record all the
variable/value pairs in this file as safe, by typing <kbd>!</kbd> at the
confirmation prompt.  When Emacs encounters these variable/value pairs
subsequently, in the same file or others, it will assume they are
safe.

   <p><a name="index-safe_002dlocal_002dvariable_002dvalues-4004"></a><a name="index-risky-variable-4005"></a>  Some variables, such as <code>load-path</code>, are considered
particularly <dfn>risky</dfn>: there is seldom any reason to specify them
as local variables, and changing them can be dangerous.  If a file
contains only risky local variables, Emacs neither offers nor accepts
<kbd>!</kbd> as input at the confirmation prompt.  If some of the local
variables in a file are risky, and some are only potentially unsafe, you
can enter <kbd>!</kbd> at the prompt.  It applies all the variables, but only
marks the non-risky ones as safe for the future.  If you really want to
record safe values for risky variables, do it directly by customizing
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">safe-local-variable-values</span></samp>&rsquo; (see <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>).

   <p><a name="index-enable_002dlocal_002dvariables-4006"></a>  The variable <code>enable-local-variables</code> allows you to change the
way Emacs processes local variables.  Its default value is <code>t</code>,
which specifies the behavior described above.  If it is <code>nil</code>,
Emacs simply ignores all file local variables.  <code>:safe</code> means use
only the safe values and ignore the rest.  Any other value says to
query you about each file that has local variables, without trying to
determine whether the values are known to be safe.

   <p><a name="index-enable_002dlocal_002deval-4007"></a><a name="index-safe_002dlocal_002deval_002dforms-4008"></a>  The variable <code>enable-local-eval</code> controls whether Emacs
processes <code>eval</code> variables.  The three possibilities for the
variable's value are <code>t</code>, <code>nil</code>, and anything else, just as
for <code>enable-local-variables</code>.  The default is <code>maybe</code>, which
is neither <code>t</code> nor <code>nil</code>, so normally Emacs does ask for
confirmation about processing <code>eval</code> variables.

   <p>As an exception, Emacs never asks for confirmation to evaluate any
<code>eval</code> form if that form occurs within the variable
<code>safe-local-eval-forms</code>.
