<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.8.1 Version Backups</h5>

<p><a name="index-version-backups-2495"></a>
<a name="index-automatic-version-backups-2496"></a>  When VC sees that the repository for a file is on a remote
machine, it automatically makes local backups of unmodified versions
of the file&mdash;<dfn>automatic version backups</dfn>.  This means that you
can compare the file to the repository version (<kbd>C-x v =</kbd>), or
revert to that version (<kbd>C-x v u</kbd>), without any network
interactions.

   <p>The local copy of the unmodified file is called a <dfn>version
backup</dfn> to indicate that it corresponds exactly to a version that is
stored in the repository.  Note that version backups are not the same
as ordinary Emacs backup files
(see <a href="Backup.html#Backup">Backup</a>). 
But they follow a similar naming convention.

   <p>For a file that comes from a remote repository, VC makes a
version backup whenever you save the first changes to the file, and
removes it after you have committed your modified version to the
repository. You can disable the making of automatic version backups by
setting <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> to <code>nil</code> (see <a href="CVS-Options.html#CVS-Options">CVS Options</a>).

   <p><a name="index-manual-version-backups-2497"></a>  The name of the automatic version backup for version <var>version</var>
of file <var>file</var> is <var>file</var><code>.~</code><var>version</var><code>.~</code>.  This is
almost the same as the name used by <kbd>C-x v ~</kbd>
(see <a href="Old-Revisions.html#Old-Revisions">Old Revisions</a>),
the only difference being the additional dot (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;)  after the
version number.  This similarity is intentional, because both kinds of
files store the same kind of information.  The file made by <kbd>C-x v
~</kbd> acts as a <dfn>manual version backup</dfn>.

   <p>All the VC commands that operate on old versions of a file can use
both kinds of version backups.  For instance, <kbd>C-x v ~</kbd> uses
either an automatic or a manual version backup, if possible, to get
the contents of the version you request.  Likewise, <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> and
<kbd>C-x v u</kbd> use either an automatic or a manual version backup, if
one of them exists, to get the contents of a version to compare or
revert to.  If you changed a file outside of Emacs, so that no
automatic version backup was created for the previous text, you can
create a manual backup of that version using <kbd>C-x v ~</kbd>, and thus
obtain the benefit of the local copy for Emacs commands.

   <p>The only difference in Emacs's handling of manual and automatic
version backups, once they exist, is that Emacs deletes automatic
version backups when you commit to the repository.  By contrast,
manual version backups remain until you delete them.
