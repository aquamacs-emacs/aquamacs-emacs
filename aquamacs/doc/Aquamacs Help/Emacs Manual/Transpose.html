   <p><a name="index-C_002dt-728"></a><a name="index-transpose_002dchars-729"></a>  The common error of transposing two characters can be fixed, when they
are adjacent, with the <kbd>C-t</kbd> command (<code>transpose-chars</code>).  Normally,
<kbd>C-t</kbd> transposes the two characters on either side of point.  When
given at the end of a line, rather than transposing the last character of
the line with the newline, which would be useless, <kbd>C-t</kbd> transposes the
last two characters on the line.  So, if you catch your transposition error
right away, you can fix it with just a <kbd>C-t</kbd>.  If you don't catch it so
fast, you must move the cursor back between the two transposed
characters before you type <kbd>C-t</kbd>.  If you transposed a space with
the last character of the word before it, the word motion commands are
a good way of getting there.  Otherwise, a reverse search (<kbd>C-r</kbd>)
is often the best way.  See <a href="Search.html#Search">Search</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dt-730"></a><a name="index-transpose_002dlines-731"></a><a name="index-M_002dt-732"></a><a name="index-transpose_002dwords-733"></a><!-- Don't index C-M-t and transpose-sexps here, they are indexed in -->
<!-- programs.texi, in the "List Commands" node. -->
<!-- @kindex C-M-t -->
<!-- @findex transpose-sexps -->
  <kbd>M-t</kbd> transposes the word before point with the word after point
(<code>transpose-words</code>).  It moves point forward over a word,
dragging the word preceding or containing point forward as well.  The
punctuation characters between the words do not move.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOO,&nbsp;BAR</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> transposes into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BAR,&nbsp;FOO</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> rather than
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BAR&nbsp;FOO,<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><kbd>C-M-t</kbd> (<code>transpose-sexps</code>) is a similar command for
transposing two expressions (see <a href="Expressions.html#Expressions">Expressions</a>), and <kbd>C-x C-t</kbd>
(<code>transpose-lines</code>) exchanges lines.  They work like <kbd>M-t</kbd>
except as regards what units of text they transpose.

   <p>A numeric argument to a transpose command serves as a repeat count: it
tells the transpose command to move the character (word, expression, line)
before or containing point across several other characters (words,
expressions, lines).  For example, <kbd>C-u 3 C-t</kbd> moves the character before
point forward across three other characters.  It would change
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f-!-oobar</span></samp>&rsquo; into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">oobf-!-ar</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is equivalent to
repeating <kbd>C-t</kbd> three times.  <kbd>C-u - 4 M-t</kbd> moves the word
before point backward across four words.  <kbd>C-u - C-M-t</kbd> would cancel
the effect of plain <kbd>C-M-t</kbd>.

   <p>A numeric argument of zero is assigned a special meaning (because
otherwise a command with a repeat count of zero would do nothing): to
transpose the character (word, expression, line) ending after point
with the one ending after the mark.
