<h3 class="section">37.15 Updating the Dired Buffer</h3>

<p><a name="index-updating-Dired-buffer-3143"></a><a name="index-refreshing-displayed-files-3144"></a>
  This section describes commands to update the Dired buffer to reflect
outside (non-Dired) changes in the directories and files, and to delete
part of the Dired buffer.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>g</kbd><dd>Update the entire contents of the Dired buffer (<code>revert-buffer</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>l</kbd><dd>Update the specified files (<code>dired-do-redisplay</code>).  You specify the
files for <kbd>l</kbd> in the same way as for file operations.

     <br><dt><kbd>k</kbd><dd>Delete the specified <em>file lines</em>&mdash;not the files, just the lines
(<code>dired-do-kill-lines</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd>Toggle between alphabetical order and date/time order
(<code>dired-sort-toggle-or-edit</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-u s </kbd><var>switches</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Refresh the Dired buffer using <var>switches</var> as
<code>dired-listing-switches</code>. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-g-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3145"></a><a name="index-revert_002dbuffer-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3146"></a>  Type <kbd>g</kbd> (<code>revert-buffer</code>) to update the contents of the
Dired buffer, based on changes in the files and directories listed. 
This preserves all marks except for those on files that have vanished. 
Hidden subdirectories are updated but remain hidden.

   <p><a name="index-l-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3147"></a><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002dredisplay-3148"></a>  To update only some of the files, type <kbd>l</kbd>
(<code>dired-do-redisplay</code>).  Like the Dired file-operating commands,
this command operates on the next <var>n</var> files (or previous
&minus;<var>n</var> files), or on the marked files if any, or on the
current file.  Updating the files means reading their current status,
then updating their lines in the buffer to indicate that status.

   <p>If you use <kbd>l</kbd> on a subdirectory header line, it updates the
contents of the corresponding subdirectory.

   <p><a name="index-dired_002dauto_002drevert_002dbuffer-3149"></a>  If you use <kbd>C-x d</kbd> or some other Dired command to visit a
directory that is already being shown in a Dired buffer, Dired
switches to that buffer but does not update it.  If the buffer is not
up-to-date, Dired displays a warning telling you to type &lt;g&gt; to
update it.  You can also tell Emacs to revert each Dired buffer
automatically when you revisit it, by setting the variable
<code>dired-auto-revert-buffer</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p><a name="index-k-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3150"></a><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002dkill_002dlines-3151"></a>  To delete the specified <em>file lines</em> from the buffer&mdash;not
delete the files&mdash;type <kbd>k</kbd> (<code>dired-do-kill-lines</code>).  Like
the file-operating commands, this command operates on the next <var>n</var>
files, or on the marked files if any; but it does not operate on the
current file as a last resort.

   <p>If you use <kbd>k</kbd> with a numeric prefix argument to kill the line
for a file that is a directory, which you have inserted in the Dired
buffer as a subdirectory, it deletes that subdirectory from the buffer
as well.  Typing <kbd>C-u k</kbd> on the header line for a subdirectory
also deletes the subdirectory from the Dired buffer.

   <p>The <kbd>g</kbd> command brings back any individual lines that you have
killed in this way, but not subdirectories&mdash;you must use <kbd>i</kbd> to
reinsert a subdirectory.

   <p><a name="index-Dired-sorting-3152"></a><a name="index-sorting-Dired-buffer-3153"></a><a name="index-s-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3154"></a><a name="index-dired_002dsort_002dtoggle_002dor_002dedit-3155"></a>  The files in a Dired buffers are normally listed in alphabetical order
by file names.  Alternatively Dired can sort them by date/time.  The
Dired command <kbd>s</kbd> (<code>dired-sort-toggle-or-edit</code>) switches
between these two sorting modes.  The mode line in a Dired buffer
indicates which way it is currently sorted&mdash;by name, or by date.

   <p><kbd>C-u s </kbd><var>switches</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> lets you specify a new value for
<code>dired-listing-switches</code>.
