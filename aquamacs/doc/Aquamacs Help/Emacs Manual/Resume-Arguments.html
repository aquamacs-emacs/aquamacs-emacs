<h3 class="appendixsec">C.4 Resuming Emacs with Arguments</h3>

<p>You can specify action arguments for Emacs when you resume it after
a suspension.  To prepare for this, put the following code in your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>):

<!-- `resume-suspend-hook' is correct.  It is the name of a function. -->
<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'suspend-hook 'resume-suspend-hook)
     (add-hook 'suspend-resume-hook 'resume-process-args)
</pre>
   <p>As further preparation, you must execute the shell script
<samp><span class="file">emacs.csh</span></samp> (if you use csh as your shell) or <samp><span class="file">emacs.bash</span></samp>
(if you use bash as your shell).  These scripts define an alias named
<code>edit</code>, which will resume Emacs giving it new command line
arguments such as files to visit.  The scripts are found in the
<samp><span class="file">etc</span></samp> subdirectory of the Emacs distribution.

   <p>Only action arguments work properly when you resume Emacs.  Initial
arguments are not recognized&mdash;it's too late to execute them anyway.

   <p>Note that resuming Emacs (with or without arguments) must be done from
within the shell that is the parent of the Emacs job.  This is why
<code>edit</code> is an alias rather than a program or a shell script.  It is
not possible to implement a resumption command that could be run from
other subjobs of the shell; there is no way to define a command that could
be made the value of <samp><span class="env">EDITOR</span></samp>, for example.  Therefore, this feature
does not take the place of the Emacs Server feature (see <a href="Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>).

   <p>The aliases use the Emacs Server feature if you appear to have a
server Emacs running.  However, they cannot determine this with complete
accuracy.  They may think that a server is still running when in
actuality you have killed that Emacs, because the file
<samp><span class="file">/tmp/esrv...</span></samp> still exists.  If this happens, find that
file and delete it.
