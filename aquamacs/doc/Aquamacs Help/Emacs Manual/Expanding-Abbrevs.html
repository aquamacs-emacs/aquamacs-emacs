<h3 class="section">33.3 Controlling Abbrev Expansion</h3>

<p>When Abbrev mode is enabled, an abbrev expands whenever it is
present in the buffer just before point and you type a self-inserting
whitespace or punctuation character (&lt;SPC&gt;, comma, etc.).  More
precisely, any character that is not a word constituent expands an
abbrev, and any word-constituent character can be part of an abbrev. 
The most common way to use an abbrev is to insert it and then insert a
punctuation or whitespace character to expand it.

   <p><a name="index-abbrev_002dall_002dcaps-2610"></a>  Abbrev expansion preserves case; thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; expands into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">find
outer otter</span></samp>&rsquo;; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Foo</span></samp>&rsquo; into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Find outer otter</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>&rsquo; into
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FIND OUTER OTTER</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Find Outer Otter</span></samp>&rsquo; according to the
variable <code>abbrev-all-caps</code> (setting it non-<code>nil</code> specifies
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FIND OUTER OTTER</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p>These commands are used to control abbrev expansion:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-'</kbd><dd>Separate a prefix from a following abbrev to be expanded
(<code>abbrev-prefix-mark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x a e</kbd><dd><a name="index-expand_002dabbrev-2611"></a>Expand the abbrev before point (<code>expand-abbrev</code>). 
This is effective even when Abbrev mode is not enabled. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x expand-region-abbrevs</kbd><dd>Expand some or all abbrevs found in the region. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0027-2612"></a><a name="index-abbrev_002dprefix_002dmark-2613"></a>  You may wish to expand an abbrev and attach a prefix to the expansion;
for example, if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cnst</span></samp>&rsquo; expands into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">construction</span></samp>&rsquo;, you might want
to use it to enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">reconstruction</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It does not work to type
<kbd>recnst</kbd>, because that is not necessarily a defined abbrev.  What
you can do is use the command <kbd>M-'</kbd> (<code>abbrev-prefix-mark</code>) in
between the prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">re</span></samp>&rsquo; and the abbrev &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cnst</span></samp>&rsquo;.  First, insert
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">re</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Then type <kbd>M-'</kbd>; this inserts a hyphen in the buffer to
indicate that it has done its work.  Then insert the abbrev &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cnst</span></samp>&rsquo;;
the buffer now contains &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">re-cnst</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Now insert a non-word character
to expand the abbrev &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cnst</span></samp>&rsquo; into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">construction</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This
expansion step also deletes the hyphen that indicated <kbd>M-'</kbd> had been
used.  The result is the desired &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">reconstruction</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If you actually want the text of the abbrev in the buffer, rather than
its expansion, you can accomplish this by inserting the following
punctuation with <kbd>C-q</kbd>.  Thus, <kbd>foo C-q ,</kbd> leaves &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo,</span></samp>&rsquo; in
the buffer, not expanding it.

   <p><a name="index-unexpand_002dabbrev-2614"></a>  If you expand an abbrev by mistake, you can undo the expansion and
bring back the abbrev itself by typing <kbd>C-_</kbd> to undo (see <a href="Undo.html#Undo">Undo</a>). 
This also undoes the insertion of the non-word character that expanded
the abbrev.  If the result you want is the terminating non-word
character plus the unexpanded abbrev, you must reinsert the terminating
character, quoting it with <kbd>C-q</kbd>.  You can also use the command
<kbd>M-x unexpand-abbrev</kbd> to cancel the last expansion without
deleting the terminating character.

   <p><a name="index-expand_002dregion_002dabbrevs-2615"></a>  <kbd>M-x expand-region-abbrevs</kbd> searches through the region for defined
abbrevs, and for each one found offers to replace it with its expansion. 
This command is useful if you have typed in text using abbrevs but forgot
to turn on Abbrev mode first.  It may also be useful together with a
special set of abbrev definitions for making several global replacements at
once.  This command is effective even if Abbrev mode is not enabled.

   <p>Expanding any abbrev runs <code>abbrev-expand-functions</code>, a special
hook.  Functions in this special hook can make arbitrary changes to
the abbrev expansion.  See <a href="../elisp/Abbrev-Expansion.html#Abbrev-Expansion">Abbrev Expansion</a>.
