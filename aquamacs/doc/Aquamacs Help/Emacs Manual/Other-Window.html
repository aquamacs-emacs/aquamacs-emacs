<dt><kbd>C-x o</kbd><dd>Select another window (<code>other-window</code>).  That is <kbd>o</kbd>, not zero.

the text in the next window. 
<br><dt><kbd>Mouse-1</kbd><dd><kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>, in a window's mode line, selects that window
but does not move point in it (<code>mouse-select-window</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-o-1130"></a><a name="index-other_002dwindow-1131"></a>  To select a different window, click with <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> on its mode
line.  With the keyboard, you can switch windows by typing <kbd>C-x o</kbd>
(<code>other-window</code>).  That is an <kbd>o</kbd>, for &ldquo;other,&rdquo; not a zero. 
When there are more than two windows, this command moves through all the
windows in a cyclic order, generally top to bottom and left to right. 
After the rightmost and bottommost window, it goes back to the one at
the upper left corner.  A numeric argument means to move several steps
in the cyclic order of windows.  A negative argument moves around the
cycle in the opposite order.  When the minibuffer is active, the
minibuffer is the last window in the cycle; you can switch from the
minibuffer window to one of the other windows, and later switch back and
finish supplying the minibuffer argument that is requested. 
See <a href="Minibuffer-Edit.html#Minibuffer-Edit">Minibuffer Edit</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dv-1132"></a><a name="index-scroll_002dother_002dwindow-1133"></a>  The usual scrolling commands (see <a href="Display.html#Display">Display</a>) apply to the selected
window only, but there is one command to scroll the next window. 
<kbd>C-M-v</kbd> (<code>scroll-other-window</code>) scrolls the window that
<kbd>C-x o</kbd> would select.  It takes arguments, positive and negative,
like <kbd>C-v</kbd>.  (In the minibuffer, <kbd>C-M-v</kbd> scrolls the window
that contains the minibuffer help display, if any, rather than the
next window in the standard cyclic order.)

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x compare-windows</kbd> lets you compare two files or
buffers visible in two windows, by moving through them to the next
mismatch.  See <a href="Comparing-Files.html#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>, for details.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dautoselect_002dwindow-1134"></a>  If you set <code>mouse-autoselect-window</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value,
moving the mouse into a different window selects that window.  This
feature is off by default.
