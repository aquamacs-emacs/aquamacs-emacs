<h3 class="section">37.2 Navigation in the Dired Buffer</h3>

<p><a name="index-C_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-2948"></a><a name="index-C_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-2949"></a>  All the usual Emacs cursor motion commands are available in Dired
buffers.  The keys <kbd>C-n</kbd> and <kbd>C-p</kbd> are redefined to put the
cursor at the beginning of the file name on the line, rather than at
the beginning of the line.

   <p><a name="index-SPC-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-2950"></a>  For extra convenience, &lt;SPC&gt; and <kbd>n</kbd> in Dired are equivalent
to <kbd>C-n</kbd>.  <kbd>p</kbd> is equivalent to <kbd>C-p</kbd>.  (Moving by lines
is so common in Dired that it deserves to be easy to type.)  &lt;DEL&gt;
(move up and unflag) is also often useful simply for moving up
(see <a href="Dired-Deletion.html#Dired-Deletion">Dired Deletion</a>).

   <p><a name="index-dired_002dgoto_002dfile-2951"></a><a name="index-j-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-2952"></a>  <kbd>j</kbd> (<code>dired-goto-file</code>) prompts for a file name using the
minibuffer, and moves point to the line in the Dired buffer describing
that file.

   <p><a name="index-searching-Dired-buffers-2953"></a><a name="index-dired_002disearch_002dfilenames-2954"></a>  <kbd>M-s f C-s</kbd> (<code>dired-isearch-filenames</code>) performs a forward
incremental search in the Dired buffer, looking for matches only
amongst the file names and ignoring the rest of the text in the
buffer.  <kbd>M-s f M-C-s</kbd> (<code>dired-isearch-filenames-regexp</code>)
does the same, using a regular expression search.  If you change the
variable <code>dired-isearch-filenames</code> to <code>t</code>, then the
usual search commands also limit themselves to the file names; for
instance, <kbd>C-s</kbd> behaves like <kbd>M-s f C-s</kbd>.  If the value is
<code>dwim</code>, then search commands match the file names only when point
was on a file name initially.  See <a href="Search.html#Search">Search</a>, for information about
incremental search.

   <p>Some additional navigation commands are available when the Dired
buffer includes several directories.  See <a href="Subdirectory-Motion.html#Subdirectory-Motion">Subdirectory Motion</a>.
