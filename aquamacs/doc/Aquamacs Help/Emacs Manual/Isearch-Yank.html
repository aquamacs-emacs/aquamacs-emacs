<h4 class="subsection">19.1.5 Isearch Yanking</h4>

<p>Within incremental search, you can use <kbd>C-w</kbd> and <kbd>C-y</kbd> to grab
text from the buffer into the search string.  This makes it convenient
to search for another occurrence of text at point.

   <p><kbd>C-w</kbd> copies the character or word after point and adds it to
the search string, advancing point over it.  (The decision, whether to
copy a character or a word, is heuristic.)

   <p><kbd>C-y</kbd> is similar to <kbd>C-w</kbd> but copies all the rest of the
current line into the search string.  If point is already at the end
of a line, it grabs the entire next line.  If the search is currently
case-insensitive, both <kbd>C-y</kbd> and <kbd>C-w</kbd> convert the text they
copy to lower case, so that the search remains case-insensitive.

   <p><kbd>C-M-w</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-y</kbd> modify the search string by only one
character at a time: <kbd>C-M-w</kbd> deletes the last character from the
search string and <kbd>C-M-y</kbd> copies the character after point to the
end of the search string.  An alternative method to add the character
after point into the search string is to enter the minibuffer by
<kbd>M-e</kbd> and to type <kbd>C-f</kbd> at the end of the search string in the
minibuffer.

   <p>The character <kbd>M-y</kbd> copies text from the kill ring into the
search string.  It uses the same text that <kbd>C-y</kbd> would yank. 
<kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> in the echo area does the same.  See <a href="Yanking.html#Yanking">Yanking</a>.
