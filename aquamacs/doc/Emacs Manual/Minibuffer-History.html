<h3 class="section">8.4 Minibuffer History</h3>

<p><a name="index-minibuffer-history-185"></a><a name="index-history-of-minibuffer-input-186"></a>
  Every argument that you enter with the minibuffer is saved in a
<dfn>minibuffer history list</dfn> so you can easily use it again later. 
You can use the following arguments to quickly fetch an earlier
argument into the minibuffer:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-p</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;Up&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the previous item in the minibuffer history, an earlier
argument (<code>previous-history-element</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-n</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;Down&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to the next item in the minibuffer history
(<code>next-history-element</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-r </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to an earlier item in the minibuffer history that
matches <var>regexp</var> (<code>previous-matching-history-element</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-s </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to a later item in the minibuffer history that matches
<var>regexp</var> (<code>next-matching-history-element</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002dp-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-187"></a><a name="index-M_002dn-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-188"></a><a name="index-next_002dhistory_002delement-189"></a><a name="index-previous_002dhistory_002delement-190"></a>  While in the minibuffer, typing <kbd>M-p</kbd> or &lt;Up&gt;
(<code>previous-history-element</code>) moves up through the minibuffer
history list, one item at a time.  Each <kbd>M-p</kbd> fetches an earlier
item from the history list into the minibuffer, replacing its existing
contents.  Similarly, typing <kbd>M-n</kbd> or &lt;Down&gt;
(<code>next-history-element</code>) moves back down the history list,
fetching later entries into the minibuffer.  You can think of these
commands as &ldquo;backwards&rdquo; and &ldquo;forwards&rdquo; through the history list.

   <p>If you type <kbd>M-n</kbd> in the minibuffer when there are no later
entries in the minibuffer history (e.g., if you haven't previously
typed <kbd>M-p</kbd>), Emacs tries fetching from a list of default
argument: values that you are likely to enter.  You can think of this
as moving through the &ldquo;future list&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;history list&rdquo;.

   <p>The input that <kbd>M-p</kbd> or <kbd>M-n</kbd> fetches into the minibuffer
entirely replaces the existing contents of the minibuffer, so you can
simply type &lt;RET&gt; to use it as an argument.  You can also edit the
text before you reuse it; this does not change the history element
that you &ldquo;moved&rdquo; to, but your new argument does go at the end of the
history list in its own right.

   <p><a name="index-previous_002dmatching_002dhistory_002delement-191"></a><a name="index-next_002dmatching_002dhistory_002delement-192"></a><a name="index-M_002dr-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-193"></a><a name="index-M_002ds-_0040r_007b_0028minibuffer-history_0029_007d-194"></a>  There are also commands to search forward or backward through the
history; they search for history elements that match a regular
expression.  <kbd>M-r</kbd> (<code>previous-matching-history-element</code>)
searches older elements in the history, while <kbd>M-s</kbd>
(<code>next-matching-history-element</code>) searches newer elements.  These
commands are unusual: they use the minibuffer to read the regular
expression even though they are invoked from the minibuffer.  As with
incremental searching, an upper-case letter in the regular expression
makes the search case-sensitive (see <a href="Search-Case.html#Search-Case">Search Case</a>).  You can also
search through the history using an incremental search (see <a href="Isearch-Minibuffer.html#Isearch-Minibuffer">Isearch Minibuffer</a>).

   <p>All uses of the minibuffer record your input on a history list, but
there are separate history lists for different kinds of arguments. 
For example, there is a list for file names, used by all the commands
that read file names.  (As a special feature, this history list
records the absolute file name, even if the name you entered was not
absolute.)

   <p>There are several other specific history lists, including one for
buffer names, one for arguments of commands like <code>query-replace</code>,
one used by <kbd>M-x</kbd> for command names, and one used by
<code>compile</code> for compilation commands.  Finally, there is one
&ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; history list that most minibuffer arguments use.

   <p><a name="index-history_002dlength-195"></a>  The variable <code>history-length</code> specifies the maximum length of a
minibuffer history list; adding a new element deletes the oldest
element if the list gets too long.  If the value of
<code>history-length</code> is <code>t</code>, there is no maximum length.

   <p><a name="index-history_002ddelete_002dduplicates-196"></a>  The variable <code>history-delete-duplicates</code> specifies whether to
delete duplicates in history.  If it is non-<code>nil</code>, adding a new
element deletes from the list all other elements that are equal to it. 
The default is <code>nil</code>.
