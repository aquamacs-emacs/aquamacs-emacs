<h3 class="section">19.6 Backslash in Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>For the most part, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by any character matches only
that character.  However, there are several exceptions: two-character
sequences starting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; that have special meanings.  The
second character in the sequence is always an ordinary character when
used on its own.  Here is a table of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; constructs.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>\|</kbd><dd>specifies an alternative.  Two regular expressions <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo; in between form an expression that matches some text if
either <var>a</var> matches it or <var>b</var> matches it.  It works by trying to
match <var>a</var>, and if that fails, by trying to match <var>b</var>.

     <p>Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo\|bar</span></samp>&rsquo; matches either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>&rsquo;
but no other string.

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo; applies to the largest possible surrounding expressions.  Only a
surrounding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo; grouping can limit the grouping power of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>Full backtracking capability exists to handle multiple uses of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><kbd>\( ... \)</kbd><dd>is a grouping construct that serves three purposes:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>To enclose a set of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo; alternatives for other operations. 
Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(foo\|bar\)x</span></samp>&rsquo; matches either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foox</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">barx</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <li>To enclose a complicated expression for the postfix operators &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; to operate on.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ba\(na\)*</span></samp>&rsquo; matches
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bananana</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc., with any (zero or more) number of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">na</span></samp>&rsquo;
strings.

          <li>To record a matched substring for future reference.
          </ol>

     <p>This last application is not a consequence of the idea of a
parenthetical grouping; it is a separate feature that is assigned as a
second meaning to the same &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo; construct.  In practice
there is usually no conflict between the two meanings; when there is
a conflict, you can use a &ldquo;shy&rdquo; group.

     <br><dt><kbd>\(?: ... \)</kbd><dd><a name="index-shy-group_002c-in-regexp-681"></a>specifies a &ldquo;shy&rdquo; group that does not record the matched substring;
you can't refer back to it with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span><var>d</var></samp>&rsquo;.  This is useful
in mechanically combining regular expressions, so that you
can add groups for syntactic purposes without interfering with
the numbering of the groups that are meant to be referred to.

     <br><dt><kbd>\</kbd><var>d</var><dd><a name="index-back-reference_002c-in-regexp-682"></a>matches the same text that matched the <var>d</var>th occurrence of a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo; construct.  This is called a <dfn>back
reference</dfn>.

     <p>After the end of a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo; construct, the matcher remembers
the beginning and end of the text matched by that construct.  Then,
later on in the regular expression, you can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by the
digit <var>d</var> to mean &ldquo;match the same text matched the <var>d</var>th time
by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo; construct.&rdquo;

     <p>The strings matching the first nine &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo; constructs
appearing in a regular expression are assigned numbers 1 through 9 in
the order that the open-parentheses appear in the regular expression. 
So you can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\1</span></samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\9</span></samp>&rsquo; to refer to the text matched
by the corresponding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo; constructs.

     <p>For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(.*\)\1</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any newline-free string that is
composed of two identical halves.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(.*\)</span></samp>&rsquo; matches the first
half, which may be anything, but the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\1</span></samp>&rsquo; that follows must match
the same exact text.

     <p>If a particular &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\( ... \)</span></samp>&rsquo; construct matches more than once
(which can easily happen if it is followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;), only the last
match is recorded.

     <br><dt><kbd>\`</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of the string or
buffer (or its accessible portion) being matched against.

     <br><dt><kbd>\'</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the end of the string or buffer
(or its accessible portion) being matched against.

     <br><dt><kbd>\=</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at point.

     <br><dt><kbd>\b</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or
end of a word.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\bfoo\b</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any occurrence of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; as a separate word.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\bballs?\b</span></samp>&rsquo; matches
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ball</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">balls</span></samp>&rsquo; as a separate word.

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\b</span></samp>&rsquo; matches at the beginning or end of the buffer
regardless of what text appears next to it.

     <br><dt><kbd>\B</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but <em>not</em> at the beginning or
end of a word.

     <br><dt><kbd>\&lt;</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of a word. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; matches at the beginning of the buffer only if a
word-constituent character follows.

     <br><dt><kbd>\&gt;</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the end of a word.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches at the end of the buffer only if the contents end with a
word-constituent character.

     <br><dt><kbd>\w</kbd><dd>matches any word-constituent character.  The syntax table
determines which characters these are.  See <a href="Syntax.html#Syntax">Syntax</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>\W</kbd><dd>matches any character that is not a word-constituent.

     <br><dt><kbd>\_&lt;</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the beginning of a symbol. 
A symbol is a sequence of one or more symbol-constituent characters. 
A symbol-constituent character is a character whose syntax is either
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo;.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\_&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; matches at the beginning of the
buffer only if a symbol-constituent character follows.

     <br><dt><kbd>\_&gt;</kbd><dd>matches the empty string, but only at the end of a symbol.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\_&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches at the end of the buffer only if the contents end with a
symbol-constituent character.

     <br><dt><kbd>\s</kbd><var>c</var><dd>matches any character whose syntax is <var>c</var>.  Here <var>c</var> is a
character that designates a particular syntax class: thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">w</span></samp>&rsquo;
for word constituent, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp> </samp>&rsquo; for whitespace, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;
for ordinary punctuation, etc.  See <a href="Syntax.html#Syntax">Syntax</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>\S</kbd><var>c</var><dd>matches any character whose syntax is not <var>c</var>.

     <p><a name="index-categories-of-characters-683"></a><a name="index-characters-which-belong-to-a-specific-language-684"></a><a name="index-describe_002dcategories-685"></a><br><dt><kbd>\c</kbd><var>c</var><dd>matches any character that belongs to the category <var>c</var>.  For
example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\cc</span></samp>&rsquo; matches Chinese characters, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\cg</span></samp>&rsquo; matches
Greek characters, etc.  For the description of the known categories,
type <kbd>M-x describe-categories &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>\C</kbd><var>c</var><dd>matches any character that does <em>not</em> belong to category
<var>c</var>. 
</dl>

   <p>The constructs that pertain to words and syntax are controlled by the
setting of the syntax table (see <a href="Syntax.html#Syntax">Syntax</a>).
