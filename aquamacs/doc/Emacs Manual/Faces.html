<h3 class="section">18.5 Faces: Controlling Text Display Style</h3>

<p><a name="index-faces-483"></a>
  Emacs can display text in several different styles, which are called
<dfn>faces</dfn>.  Each face can specify various <dfn>face attributes</dfn>,
such as the font, height, weight and slant, the foreground and
background color, and underlining or overlining.  A face does not have
to specify all of these attributes; often it inherits most of them
from another face.

   <p>On a text-only terminal, not all face attributes are meaningful. 
Some text-only terminals support inverse video, bold, and underline
attributes; some support colors.  Text-only terminals generally do not
support changing the height, width or font.

   <p>Most major modes assign faces to the text automatically through the
work of Font Lock mode.  See <a href="Font-Lock.html#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>, for more information about
Font Lock mode and syntactic highlighting.  You can print the current
buffer with the highlighting that appears on your screen using the
command <code>ps-print-buffer-with-faces</code>.  See <a href="PostScript.html#PostScript">PostScript</a>.

   <p>Enriched mode, the mode for editing formatted text, provides
commands and menus for specifying faces for text in the buffer. 
See <a href="Format-Faces.html#Format-Faces">Format Faces</a>.

   <p><a name="index-face-colors_002c-setting-484"></a>  To alter the appearance of a face, use the customization buffer. 
See <a href="Face-Customization.html#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>.  You can also use X resources to specify
attributes of any particular face (see <a href="Resources.html#Resources">Resources</a>).  When
displaying a character, any attribute that isn't specified by its face
is taken from the <code>default</code> face, whose attributes reflect the
default settings of the frame itself.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dface_002dforeground-485"></a><a name="index-set_002dface_002dbackground-486"></a>  You can also change the foreground and background colors of a
specific face with <kbd>M-x set-face-foreground</kbd> and <kbd>M-x
set-face-background</kbd>.  These commands prompt in the minibuffer for a
face name and a color name, with completion, and then set that face to
use the specified color.  See <a href="Face-Customization.html#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>, for information
about color names.  These commands affect the face colors on all
frames, both existing and those to be created in the future.  These
changes do not, however, persist for future Emacs sessions; to make
lasting changes, use the customization buffer (see <a href="Face-Customization.html#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>).

   <p>You can also set foreground and background colors for the current
frame only; see <a href="Frame-Parameters.html#Frame-Parameters">Frame Parameters</a>.

   <p>Emacs can display variable-width fonts, but some of the Emacs
commands that calculate width and indentation do not know how to
calculate variable widths.  This can sometimes lead to incorrect
results when you use variable-width fonts.  In particular, indentation
commands can give inconsistent results, so we recommend you avoid
variable-width fonts, especially for editing program source code.
