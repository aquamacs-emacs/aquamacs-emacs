<p><a name="index-European-character-sets-1462"></a><a name="index-accented-characters-1463"></a><a name="index-ISO-Latin-character-sets-1464"></a><a name="index-Unibyte-operation-1465"></a>  The ISO 8859 Latin-<var>n</var> character sets define character codes in
the range 0240 to 0377 octal (160 to 255 decimal) to handle the
accented letters and punctuation needed by various European languages
(and some non-European ones).  Note that Emacs considers bytes with
codes in this range as raw bytes, not as characters, even in a unibyte
session, i.e. if you disable multibyte characters.  However, Emacs
can still handle these character codes as if they belonged to
<em>one</em> of the single-byte character sets at a time.  To specify
<em>which</em> of these codes to use, invoke <kbd>M-x
set-language-environment</kbd> and specify a suitable language environment
such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Latin-</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>For more information about unibyte operation, see <a href="Enabling-Multibyte.html#Enabling-Multibyte">Enabling Multibyte</a>.  Note particularly that you probably want to ensure that
your initialization files are read as unibyte if they contain
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters.

   <p><a name="index-unibyte_002ddisplay_002dvia_002dlanguage_002denvironment-1466"></a>  Emacs can also display bytes in the range 160 to 255 as readable
characters, provided the terminal or font in use supports them.  This
works automatically.  On a graphical display, Emacs can also display
single-byte characters through fontsets, in effect by displaying the
equivalent multibyte characters according to the current language
environment.  To request this, set the variable
<code>unibyte-display-via-language-environment</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value.  Note that setting this only affects how these bytes are
displayed, but does not change the fundamental fact that Emacs treats
them as raw bytes, not as characters.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007biso_002dascii_007d-library-1467"></a>  If your terminal does not support display of the Latin-1 character
set, Emacs can display these characters as <acronym>ASCII</acronym> sequences which at
least give you a clear idea of what the characters are.  To do this,
load the library <code>iso-ascii</code>.  Similar libraries for other
Latin-<var>n</var> character sets could be implemented, but we don't have
them yet.

   <p><a name="index-standard_002ddisplay_002d8bit-1468"></a><a name="index-g_t8_002dbit-display-1469"></a>  Normally non-ISO-8859 characters (decimal codes between 128 and 159
inclusive) are displayed as octal escapes.  You can change this for
non-standard &ldquo;extended&rdquo; versions of ISO-8859 character sets by using the
function <code>standard-display-8bit</code> in the <code>disp-table</code> library.

   <p>There are two ways to input single-byte non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters:

     
<a name="index-g_t8_002dbit-input-1470"></a>
<ul><li>You can use an input method for the selected language environment. 
See <a href="Input-Methods.html#Input-Methods">Input Methods</a>.  When you use an input method in a unibyte buffer,
the non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character you specify with it is converted to unibyte.

     <li>If your keyboard can generate character codes 128 (decimal) and up,
representing non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters, you can type those character codes
directly.

     <p>On a graphical display, you should not need to do anything special to use
these keys; they should simply work.  On a text-only terminal, you
should use the command <code>M-x set-keyboard-coding-system</code> or the
variable <code>keyboard-coding-system</code> to specify which coding system
your keyboard uses (see <a href="Terminal-Coding.html#Terminal-Coding">Terminal Coding</a>).  Enabling this feature
will probably require you to use <kbd>ESC</kbd> to type Meta characters;
however, on a console terminal or in <code>xterm</code>, you can arrange for
Meta to be converted to <kbd>ESC</kbd> and still be able type 8-bit
characters present directly on the keyboard or using <kbd>Compose</kbd> or
<kbd>AltGr</kbd> keys.  See <a href="User-Input.html#User-Input">User Input</a>.

     <p><a name="index-C_002dx-8-1471"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007biso_002dtransl_007d-library-1472"></a><a name="index-compose-character-1473"></a><a name="index-dead-character-1474"></a><li>For Latin-1 only, you can use the key <kbd>C-x 8</kbd> as a &ldquo;compose
character&rdquo; prefix for entry of non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> Latin-1 printing
characters.  <kbd>C-x 8</kbd> is good for insertion (in the minibuffer as
well as other buffers), for searching, and in any other context where
a key sequence is allowed.

     <p><kbd>C-x 8</kbd> works by loading the <code>iso-transl</code> library.  Once that
library is loaded, the &lt;ALT&gt; modifier key, if the keyboard has
one, serves the same purpose as <kbd>C-x 8</kbd>: use &lt;ALT&gt; together
with an accent character to modify the following letter.  In addition,
if the keyboard has keys for the Latin-1 &ldquo;dead accent characters,&rdquo;
they too are defined to compose with the following character, once
<code>iso-transl</code> is loaded.

     <p>Use <kbd>C-x 8 C-h</kbd> to list all the available <kbd>C-x 8</kbd> translations. 
</ul>
