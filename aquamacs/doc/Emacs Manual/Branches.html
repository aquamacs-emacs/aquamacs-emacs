<h4 class="subsection">32.1.7 Multiple Branches of a File</h4>

<p><a name="index-branch-_0028version-control_0029-2485"></a><a name="index-trunk-_0028version-control_0029-2486"></a>
  One use of version control is to maintain multiple &ldquo;current&rdquo;
revisions of a file.  For example, you might have different revisions of a
program in which you are gradually adding various unfinished new
features.  Each such independent line of development is called a
<dfn>branch</dfn>.  VC allows you to create branches, switch between
different branches, and merge changes from one branch to another. 
Please note, however, that branches are not supported for SCCS.

   <p>A file's main line of development is usually called the <dfn>trunk</dfn>. 
You can create multiple branches from the trunk.  How the difference
between trunk and branch is made visible is dependent on whether the
VCS uses dot-pair or monotonic version IDs.

   <p>In VCSes with dot-pair revision IDs, the revisions on the trunk are
normally IDed 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.  At any such revision, you can
start an independent branch.  A branch starting at revision 1.2 would
have revision ID 1.2.1.1, and consecutive revisions on this branch
would have IDs 1.2.1.2, 1.2.1.3, 1.2.1.4, and so on.  If there is
a second branch also starting at revision 1.2, it would consist of
revisions 1.2.2.1, 1.2.2.2, 1.2.2.3, etc.

   <p>In VCSes with monotonic revision IDs, trunk revisions are IDed as
1, 2, 3, etc.  A branch from (say) revision 2 might start with 2.1 and
continue through 2.2, 2.3, etc.  But naming conventions for branches
and subbranches vary widely on these systems, and some (like
Mercurial) never depart from the monotonic integer sequence at all. 
Consult the documentation of the VCS you are using.

   <p><a name="index-head-revision-2487"></a>  If you omit the final component of a dot-pair revision ID, that is called a
<dfn>branch ID</dfn>.  It refers to the highest existing revision on that
branch&mdash;the <dfn>head revision</dfn> of that branch.  The branches in the
dot-pair example above have branch IDs 1.2.1 and 1.2.2.
