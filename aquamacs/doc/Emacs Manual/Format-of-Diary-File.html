<h4 class="subsection">38.10.2 The Diary File</h4>

<p><a name="index-diary-file-3345"></a>
<a name="index-diary_002dfile-3346"></a>  Your <dfn>diary file</dfn> is a file that records events associated with
particular dates.  The name of the diary file is specified by the
variable <code>diary-file</code>; <samp><span class="file">~/diary</span></samp> is the default.  The
<code>calendar</code> utility program supports a subset of the format allowed
by the Emacs diary facilities, so you can use that utility to view the
diary file, with reasonable results aside from the entries it cannot
understand.

   <p>Each entry in the diary file describes one event and consists of one
or more lines.  An entry always begins with a date specification at the
left margin.  The rest of the entry is simply text to describe the
event.  If the entry has more than one line, then the lines after the
first must begin with whitespace to indicate they continue a previous
entry.  Lines that do not begin with valid dates and do not continue a
preceding entry are ignored.

   <p>You can also use a format where the first line of a diary entry
consists only of the date or day name (with no following blanks or
punctuation).  For example:

<pre class="example">     02/11/1989
           Bill B. visits Princeton today
           2pm Cognitive Studies Committee meeting
           2:30-5:30 Liz at Lawrenceville
           4:00pm Dentist appt
           7:30pm Dinner at George's
           8:00-10:00pm concert
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This entry will have a different appearance if you use the simple diary
display
(see <a href="Diary-Display.html#Diary-Display">Diary Display</a>). 
The simple diary display omits the date line at the beginning; only the
continuation lines appear.  This style of entry looks neater when you
display just a single day's entries, but can cause confusion if you ask
for more than one day's entries.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dnonmarking_002dsymbol-3347"></a>  You can inhibit the marking of certain diary entries in the calendar
window; to do this, insert an ampersand <code>diary-nonmarking-symbol</code>
(default &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;) at the beginning of the entry, before the date.  This
has no effect on display of the entry in the diary window; it affects
only marks on dates in the calendar window.  Nonmarking entries are
especially useful for generic entries that would otherwise mark many
different dates.
