<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.5.3 Undoing Version Control Actions</h5>

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v u</kbd><dd>Revert the buffer and the file to the working revision from which you started
editing the file.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x v c</kbd><dd>Remove the last-entered change from the master for the visited file. 
This undoes your last check-in. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-u-2471"></a><a name="index-vc_002drevert_002dbuffer-2472"></a>  If you want to discard your current set of changes and revert to the
working revision from which you started editing the file, use <kbd>C-x
v u</kbd> (<code>vc-revert-buffer</code>).  If the version control system is
locking-based, this leaves the file unlocked, and you must lock it
again before making new changes.  <kbd>C-x v u</kbd> requires confirmation,
unless it sees that you haven't made any changes with respect to the
master copy of the working revision.

   <p><kbd>C-x v u</kbd> is also the command to unlock a file if you lock it and
then decide not to change it.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-c-2473"></a><a name="index-vc_002drollback-2474"></a>  To cancel a change that you already checked in, use <kbd>C-x v c</kbd>
(<code>vc-rollback</code>).  This command discards all record of the most
recent checked-in revision, but only if your work file corresponds to
that revision&mdash;you cannot use <kbd>C-x v c</kbd> to cancel a revision that
is not the latest on its branch.  Note that many version control
systems do not support rollback at all; this command is something of a
historical relic.
