<h4 class="subsection">32.1.4 Examining And Comparing Old Revisions</h4>

<p>One of the convenient features of version control is the ability
to examine any revision of a file, or compare two revisions.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v ~</kbd><dd>Prompt for a revision of the current file, and visit it in a buffer of
its own (<code>vc-revision-other-window</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x v =</kbd><dd>Compare the files in the current fileset with the working revision(s)
you started from (<code>vc-diff</code>).  With a prefix argument, prompt for
two revisions of the current fileset and compare them.  You can call
this command from a Dired buffer (see <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x v D</kbd><dd>Compare the entire tree corresponding to the current fileset with the
tree you started from (<code>vc-root-diff</code>).  With a prefix argument,
prompt for two revisions and compare their trees.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x v g</kbd><dd>Display an annotated version of the file: for each line, show the
latest revision in which it was modified (<code>vc-annotate</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-vc_002drevision_002dother_002dwindow-2452"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-_007e-2453"></a>  To examine an old revision, visit the work file and type <kbd>C-x v
~ </kbd><var>revision</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>vc-revision-other-window</code>).  Here,
<var>revision</var> is either the desired revision ID (see <a href="VCS-Concepts.html#VCS-Concepts">VCS Concepts</a>), or the name of a tag or branch
(see <a href="Tags.html#Tags">Tags</a>). 
This command puts the text of the old revision in a file named
<samp><var>filename</var><span class="file">.~</span><var>revision</var><span class="file">~</span></samp>, and visits it in its own
buffer in a separate window.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddiff-2454"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-_003d-2455"></a>  <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> (<code>vc-diff</code>) compares each file in the current VC
fileset (saving them if necessary) with the repository revision(s)
from which you started editing.  Note that the latter may or may not
be the latest revision of the file(s).  The diff is displayed in a
special buffer in another window.  See <a href="Comparing-Files.html#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddiff-2456"></a><a name="index-C_002du-C_002dx-v-_003d-2457"></a>  To compare two arbitrary revisions of the current VC fileset, call
<code>vc-diff</code> with a prefix argument: <kbd>C-u C-x v =</kbd>.  This
prompts for two revision IDs, using the minibuffer, and displays the
diff in a special buffer in another window.  Instead of providing a
revision ID, you can give an empty input, which specifies the current
contents of the work file; or a tag or branch name
(see <a href="Tags.html#Tags">Tags</a>). 
If your version control system is file-based (e.g. CVS) rather than
changeset-based (Subversion, GNU Arch, git, Mercurial), supplying a
revision ID for a multi-file fileset (as opposed to a symbolic tag
name) is unlikely to return diffs that are connected in any meaningful
way.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-x v D</kbd> (<code>vc-root-diff</code>) is similar to
<kbd>C-x v =</kbd>, but it compares the entire tree associated with the
current VC fileset with the tree you started with.  This means all the
files controlled by the current version control repository, even those
that are not part of the current VC fileset.

   <p>If you invoke <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> or <kbd>C-u C-x v =</kbd> from a buffer that
is neither visiting a version-controlled file nor a VC directory
buffer, these commands generate a diff of all registered files in the
current directory and its subdirectories.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddiff_002dswitches-2458"></a><a name="index-vc_002drcs_002ddiff_002dswitches-2459"></a>  <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> works by running a variant of the <code>diff</code> utility
designed to work with the version control system in use.  The options
to pass to the <code>diff</code> command are taken from the first non-<code>nil</code>
value of <code>vc-</code><var>backend</var><code>-diff-switches</code>, <code>vc-diff-switches</code>,
and <code>diff-switches</code> (see <a href="Comparing-Files.html#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>), in that order. 
Since <code>nil</code> means to check the next variable in the sequence,
either of the first two may use the value <code>t</code> to mean no switches at all. 
Most of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vc...diff-switches</span></samp>&rsquo; variables default to
<code>nil</code>, but some default to <code>t</code>.  These are for those version
control systems (e.g. SVN) whose <code>diff</code> implementations do not
accept common options (e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-c</span></samp>&rsquo;) likely to be in
<code>diff-switches</code>.

   <p>The buffer produced by <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> supports the commands of
Compilation mode (see <a href="Compilation-Mode.html#Compilation-Mode">Compilation Mode</a>), such as <kbd>C-x `</kbd> and
<kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, in both the &ldquo;old&rdquo; and &ldquo;new&rdquo; text, and they always
find the corresponding locations in the current work file.  (Older
revisions are not, in general, present as files on your disk.)

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dannotate-2460"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-g-2461"></a>  For some back ends, you can display the file <dfn>annotated</dfn> with
per-line revision information, by typing <kbd>C-x v g</kbd>
(<code>vc-annotate</code>).  This creates a new buffer (the &ldquo;annotate
buffer&rdquo;) displaying the file's text, with each part colored to show
how old it is.  Text colored red is new, blue means old, and
intermediate colors indicate intermediate ages.  By default, the color
is scaled over the full range of ages, such that the oldest changes
are blue, and the newest changes are red.

   <p>When you give a prefix argument to this command, Emacs reads two
arguments using the minibuffer: the ID of which revision to display and
annotate (instead of the current file contents), and the time span in
days the color range should cover.

   <p>From the annotate buffer, these and other color scaling options are
available from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VC-Annotate</span></samp>&rsquo; menu.  In this buffer, you can
also use the following keys to browse the annotations of past revisions,
view diffs, or view log entries:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Annotate the previous revision, that is to say, the revision before
the one currently annotated.  A numeric prefix argument is a repeat
count, so <kbd>C-u 10 p</kbd> would take you back 10 revisions.

     <br><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>Annotate the next revision&mdash;the one after the revision currently
annotated.  A numeric prefix argument is a repeat count.

     <br><dt><kbd>j</kbd><dd>Annotate the revision indicated by the current line.

     <br><dt><kbd>a</kbd><dd>Annotate the revision before the one indicated by the current line. 
This is useful to see the state the file was in before the change on
the current line was made.

     <br><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>Show in a buffer the file revision indicated by the current line.

     <br><dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Display the diff between the current line's revision and the previous
revision.  This is useful to see what the current line's revision
actually changed in the file.

     <br><dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd>Display the diff between the current line's revision and the previous
revision for all files in the changeset (for VC systems that support
changesets).  This is useful to see what the current line's revision
actually changed in the tree.

     <br><dt><kbd>l</kbd><dd>Show the log of the current line's revision.  This is useful to see
the author's description of the changes in the revision on the current
line.

     <br><dt><kbd>w</kbd><dd>Annotate the working revision&ndash;the one you are editing.  If you used
<kbd>p</kbd> and <kbd>n</kbd> to browse to other revisions, use this key to
return to your working revision.

     <br><dt><kbd>v</kbd><dd>Toggle the annotation visibility.  This is useful for looking just at
the file contents without distraction from the annotations.
