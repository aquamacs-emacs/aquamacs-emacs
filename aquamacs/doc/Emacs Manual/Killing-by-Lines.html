<h3 class="section">12.2 Killing by Lines</h3>

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-k</kbd><dd>Kill rest of line or one or more lines (<code>kill-line</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-S-backspace</kbd><dd>Kill an entire line at once (<code>kill-whole-line</code>)
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dk-343"></a><a name="index-kill_002dline-344"></a>  The simplest kill command is <kbd>C-k</kbd>.  If given at the beginning
of a line, it kills all the text on the line<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, leaving it blank.  When used on a blank line, it kills the
whole line including its newline.

   <p>More precisely, <kbd>C-k</kbd> kills from point up to the end of the
line, unless it is at the end of a line.  In that case it kills the
newline following point, thus merging the next line into the current
one.  Spaces and tabs at the end of the line are ignored when deciding
which case applies, so as long as point is after the last visible
character in the line, you can be sure that <kbd>C-k</kbd> will kill the
newline.  To kill an entire non-blank line, go to the beginning and
type <kbd>C-k</kbd> twice.

   <p>When <kbd>C-k</kbd> is given a positive argument <var>n</var>, it kills
<var>n</var> lines and the newlines that follow them (text on the current
line before point is not killed).  With a negative argument
&minus;<var>n</var>, it kills <var>n</var> lines preceding the current line,
together with the text on the current line before point.  <kbd>C-k</kbd>
with an argument of zero kills the text before point on the current
line.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dwhole_002dline-345"></a>  If the variable <code>kill-whole-line</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, <kbd>C-k</kbd> at
the very beginning of a line kills the entire line including the
following newline.  This variable is normally <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dS_002dbackspace-346"></a><a name="index-kill_002dwhole_002dline-347"></a>  <kbd>C-S-backspace</kbd> (<code>kill-whole-line</code>) will kill a whole line
including its newline regardless of the position of point within the
line.  Note that many character terminals will prevent you from typing
the key sequence <kbd>C-S-backspace</kbd>.
