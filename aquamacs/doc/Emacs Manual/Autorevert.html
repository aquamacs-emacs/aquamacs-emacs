<h3 class="section">22.5 Auto Reverting Non-File Buffers</h3>

<p>Global Auto Revert Mode normally only reverts file buffers.  There are
two ways to auto-revert certain non-file buffers: enabling Auto Revert
Mode in those buffers (using <kbd>M-x auto-revert-mode</kbd>); and setting
<code>global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers</code> non-<code>nil</code>.  The latter
enables Auto Reverting for all types of buffers for which it is
implemented (listed in the menu below).

   <p>Like file buffers, non-file buffers should normally not revert while
you are working on them, or while they contain information that might
get lost after reverting.  Therefore, they do not revert if they are
&ldquo;modified&rdquo;.  This can get tricky, because deciding when a non-file
buffer should be marked modified is usually more difficult than for
file buffers.

   <p>Another tricky detail is that, for efficiency reasons, Auto Revert
often does not try to detect all possible changes in the buffer, only
changes that are &ldquo;major&rdquo; or easy to detect.  Hence, enabling
auto-reverting for a non-file buffer does not always guarantee that
all information in the buffer is up-to-date, and does not necessarily
make manual reverts useless.

   <p>At the other extreme, certain buffers automatically revert every
<code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds.  (This currently only applies to
the Buffer Menu.)  In this case, Auto Revert does not print any
messages while reverting, even when <code>auto-revert-verbose</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>.

   <p>The details depend on the particular types of buffers and are
explained in the corresponding sections.
