<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.3.2 Basic Version Control with Locking</h5>

<p>Under a locking-based version control system (such as SCCS, and RCS
in its default mode), <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> does the following:

     <ul>
<li>If the file is not locked, lock it and make it writable, so that you
can change it.

     <li>If the file is locked by you, and contains changes, check in the
changes.  In order to do this, Emacs first reads the log entry for the
new revision.  See <a href="Log-Buffer.html#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>.

     <li>If the file is locked by you, but you have not changed it since you
locked it, release the lock and makes the file read-only again.

     <li>If the file is locked by some other user, ask whether you want to
&ldquo;steal the lock&rdquo; from that user.  If you say yes, the file becomes
locked by you, but a message is sent to the person who had formerly
locked the file, to inform him of what has happened. 
</ul>

   <p>These rules also apply when you use CVS in locking mode, except
that there is no such thing as stealing a lock.
