<h2 class="chapter">60 Reporting Bugs</h2>

<p><a name="index-bugs-4101"></a>  Sometimes you will encounter a bug in Emacs.  Although we cannot
promise we can or will fix the bug, and we might not even agree that it
is a bug, we want to hear about problems you encounter.  Often we agree
they are bugs and want to fix them.

   <p>To make it possible for us to fix a bug, you must report it.  In order
to do so effectively, you must know when and how to do it.

   <p>Before reporting a bug, it is a good idea to see if it is already
known.  You can find the list of known problems in the file
<samp><span class="file">etc/PROBLEMS</span></samp> in the Emacs distribution; type <kbd>C-h C-p</kbd> to read
it.  Some additional user-level problems can be found in <a href="../efaq/Bugs-and-problems.html#Bugs-and-problems">Bugs and problems</a>.  Looking up your
problem in these two documents might provide you with a solution or a
work-around, or give you additional information about related issues.
