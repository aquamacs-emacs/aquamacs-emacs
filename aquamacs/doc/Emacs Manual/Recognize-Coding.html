<h3 class="section">26.7 Recognizing Coding Systems</h3>

<p>Whenever Emacs reads a given piece of text, it tries to recognize
which coding system to use.  This applies to files being read, output
from subprocesses, text from X selections, etc.  Emacs can select the
right coding system automatically most of the time&mdash;once you have
specified your preferences.

   <p>Some coding systems can be recognized or distinguished by which byte
sequences appear in the data.  However, there are coding systems that
cannot be distinguished, not even potentially.  For example, there is no
way to distinguish between Latin-1 and Latin-2; they use the same byte
values with different meanings.

   <p>Emacs handles this situation by means of a priority list of coding
systems.  Whenever Emacs reads a file, if you do not specify the coding
system to use, Emacs checks the data against each coding system,
starting with the first in priority and working down the list, until it
finds a coding system that fits the data.  Then it converts the file
contents assuming that they are represented in this coding system.

   <p>The priority list of coding systems depends on the selected language
environment (see <a href="Language-Environments.html#Language-Environments">Language Environments</a>).  For example, if you use
French, you probably want Emacs to prefer Latin-1 to Latin-2; if you use
Czech, you probably want Latin-2 to be preferred.  This is one of the
reasons to specify a language environment.

   <p><a name="index-prefer_002dcoding_002dsystem-1410"></a>  However, you can alter the coding system priority list in detail
with the command <kbd>M-x prefer-coding-system</kbd>.  This command reads
the name of a coding system from the minibuffer, and adds it to the
front of the priority list, so that it is preferred to all others.  If
you use this command several times, each use adds one element to the
front of the priority list.

   <p>If you use a coding system that specifies the end-of-line conversion
type, such as <code>iso-8859-1-dos</code>, what this means is that Emacs
should attempt to recognize <code>iso-8859-1</code> with priority, and should
use DOS end-of-line conversion when it does recognize <code>iso-8859-1</code>.

   <p><a name="index-file_002dcoding_002dsystem_002dalist-1411"></a>  Sometimes a file name indicates which coding system to use for the
file.  The variable <code>file-coding-system-alist</code> specifies this
correspondence.  There is a special function
<code>modify-coding-system-alist</code> for adding elements to this list.  For
example, to read and write all &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.txt</span></samp>&rsquo; files using the coding system
<code>chinese-iso-8bit</code>, you can execute this Lisp expression:

<pre class="smallexample">     (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.txt\\'" 'chinese-iso-8bit)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first argument should be <code>file</code>, the second argument should be
a regular expression that determines which files this applies to, and
the third argument says which coding system to use for these files.

   <p><a name="index-inhibit_002deol_002dconversion-1412"></a><a name="index-DOS_002dstyle-end_002dof_002dline-display-1413"></a>  Emacs recognizes which kind of end-of-line conversion to use based on
the contents of the file: if it sees only carriage-returns, or only
carriage-return linefeed sequences, then it chooses the end-of-line
conversion accordingly.  You can inhibit the automatic use of
end-of-line conversion by setting the variable <code>inhibit-eol-conversion</code>
to non-<code>nil</code>.  If you do that, DOS-style files will be displayed
with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^M</span></samp>&rsquo; characters visible in the buffer; some people
prefer this to the more subtle &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(DOS)</span></samp>&rsquo; end-of-line type
indication near the left edge of the mode line (see <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">eol-mnemonic</a>).

   <p><a name="index-inhibit_002diso_002descape_002ddetection-1414"></a><a name="index-escape-sequences-in-files-1415"></a>  By default, the automatic detection of coding system is sensitive to
escape sequences.  If Emacs sees a sequence of characters that begin
with an escape character, and the sequence is valid as an ISO-2022
code, that tells Emacs to use one of the ISO-2022 encodings to decode
the file.

   <p>However, there may be cases that you want to read escape sequences
in a file as is.  In such a case, you can set the variable
<code>inhibit-iso-escape-detection</code> to non-<code>nil</code>.  Then the code
detection ignores any escape sequences, and never uses an ISO-2022
encoding.  The result is that all escape sequences become visible in
the buffer.

   <p>The default value of <code>inhibit-iso-escape-detection</code> is
<code>nil</code>.  We recommend that you not change it permanently, only for
one specific operation.  That's because many Emacs Lisp source files
in the Emacs distribution contain non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters encoded in the
coding system <code>iso-2022-7bit</code>, and they won't be
decoded correctly when you visit those files if you suppress the
escape sequence detection.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dcoding_002dalist-1416"></a><a name="index-auto_002dcoding_002dregexp_002dalist-1417"></a><a name="index-auto_002dcoding_002dfunctions-1418"></a>  The variables <code>auto-coding-alist</code>,
<code>auto-coding-regexp-alist</code> and <code>auto-coding-functions</code> are
the strongest way to specify the coding system for certain patterns of
file names, or for files containing certain patterns; these variables
even override &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-coding:-*-</span></samp>&rsquo; tags in the file itself.  Emacs
uses <code>auto-coding-alist</code> for tar and archive files, to prevent it
from being confused by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-coding:-*-</span></samp>&rsquo; tag in a member of the
archive and thinking it applies to the archive file as a whole. 
Likewise, Emacs uses <code>auto-coding-regexp-alist</code> to ensure that
RMAIL files, whose names in general don't match any particular
pattern, are decoded correctly.  One of the builtin
<code>auto-coding-functions</code> detects the encoding for XML files.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002ddecode_002dmime_002dcharset-1419"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dfile_002dcoding_002dsystem-1420"></a>  When you get new mail in Rmail, each message is translated
automatically from the coding system it is written in, as if it were a
separate file.  This uses the priority list of coding systems that you
have specified.  If a MIME message specifies a character set, Rmail
obeys that specification, unless <code>rmail-decode-mime-charset</code> is
<code>nil</code>.  For reading and saving Rmail files themselves, Emacs uses
the coding system specified by the variable
<code>rmail-file-coding-system</code>.  The default value is <code>nil</code>,
which means that Rmail files are not translated (they are read and
written in the Emacs internal character code).
