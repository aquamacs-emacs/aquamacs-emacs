<h4 class="subsection">32.1.8 Remote Repositories</h4>

<p><a name="index-remote-repositories-2494"></a>
  A common way of using CVS and other more advanced VCSes is to set up
a central repository on some Internet host, then have each
developer check out a personal working copy of the files on his local
machine.  Committing changes to the repository, and picking up changes
from other users into one's own working area, then works by direct
interactions with the repository server.

   <p>One difficulty is that access to a repository server is often slow,
and that developers might need to work off-line as well.  While only
third-generation decentralized VCses such as GNU Arch or Mercurial
really solve this problem, VC is designed to reduce the amount of
network interaction necessary.

   <p>If you are using a truly decentralized VCS you can skip the rest of
this section. It describes backup and local-repository techniques
that are only useful for Subversion and earlier VCSes.
