<h3 class="section">36.10 Sending Replies</h3>

<p>Rmail has several commands that use Mail mode to send outgoing mail. 
See <a href="Sending-Mail.html#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>, for information on using Mail mode, including
certain features meant to work with Rmail.  What this section documents
are the special commands of Rmail for entering Mail mode.  Note that the
usual keys for sending mail&mdash;<kbd>C-x m</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd>, and <kbd>C-x 5
m</kbd>&mdash;also work normally in Rmail mode.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>m</kbd><dd>Send a message (<code>rmail-mail</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>c</kbd><dd>Continue editing the already started outgoing message (<code>rmail-continue</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd>Send a reply to the current Rmail message (<code>rmail-reply</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>Forward the current message to other users (<code>rmail-forward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-u f</kbd><dd>Resend the current message to other users (<code>rmail-resend</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-m</kbd><dd>Try sending a bounced message a second time (<code>rmail-retry-failure</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-r-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-2833"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dreply-2834"></a><a name="index-reply-to-a-message-2835"></a>  The most common reason to send a message while in Rmail is to reply
to the message you are reading.  To do this, type <kbd>r</kbd>
(<code>rmail-reply</code>).  This displays the `<samp><span class="samp">*mail*</span></samp>' buffer in
another window, much like <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd>, but preinitializes the
`<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">In-reply-to</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">References</span></samp>' header fields based on the message you are replying
to.  The `<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>' field starts out as the address of the person who
sent the message you received, and the `<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>' field starts out with
all the other recipients of that message.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002ddont_002dreply_002dto_002dnames-2836"></a>  You can exclude certain recipients from being included automatically
in replies, using the variable <code>rmail-dont-reply-to-names</code>.  Its
value should be a regular expression; any recipients that match are
excluded from the `<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>' field.  They are also excluded from the
`<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>' field, unless this would leave the field empty.  If this
variable is nil, then the first time you compose a reply it is
initialized to a default value that matches your own address, and any
name starting with `<samp><span class="samp">info-</span></samp>'.  (Those names are excluded because
there is a convention of using them for large mailing lists to broadcast
announcements.)

   <p>To omit the `<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>' field completely for a particular reply, enter
the reply command with a numeric argument: <kbd>C-u r</kbd> or <kbd>1 r</kbd>. 
This means to reply only to the sender of the original message.

   <p>Once the `<samp><span class="samp">*mail*</span></samp>' buffer has been initialized, editing and
sending the mail goes as usual (see <a href="Sending-Mail.html#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>).  You can edit the
presupplied header fields if they are not what you want.  You can also
use the commands of Mail mode (see <a href="Mail-Mode.html#Mail-Mode">Mail Mode</a>), including <kbd>C-c
C-y</kbd> which yanks in the message that you are replying to.  You can
also switch to the Rmail buffer, select a different message there, switch
back, and yank the new current message.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dm-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-2837"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dretry_002dfailure-2838"></a><a name="index-retrying-a-failed-message-2839"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dretry_002dignored_002dheaders-2840"></a>  Sometimes a message does not reach its destination.  Mailers usually
send the failed message back to you, enclosed in a <dfn>failure
message</dfn>.  The Rmail command <kbd>M-m</kbd> (<code>rmail-retry-failure</code>)
prepares to send the same message a second time: it sets up a
`<samp><span class="samp">*mail*</span></samp>' buffer with the same text and header fields as before.  If
you type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> right away, you send the message again exactly
the same as the first time.  Alternatively, you can edit the text or
headers and then send it.  The variable
<code>rmail-retry-ignored-headers</code>, in the same format as
<code>rmail-ignored-headers</code> (see <a href="Rmail-Display.html#Rmail-Display">Rmail Display</a>), controls which
headers are stripped from the failed message when retrying it.

   <p><a name="index-f-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-2841"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dforward-2842"></a><a name="index-forwarding-a-message-2843"></a>  Another frequent reason to send mail in Rmail is to <dfn>forward</dfn> the
current message to other users.  <kbd>f</kbd> (<code>rmail-forward</code>) makes
this easy by preinitializing the `<samp><span class="samp">*mail*</span></samp>' buffer with the current
message as the text, and a subject designating a forwarded message.  All
you have to do is fill in the recipients and send.  When you forward a
message, recipients get a message which is &ldquo;from&rdquo; you, and which has
the original message in its contents.

   <p><a name="index-unforward_002drmail_002dmessage-2844"></a>  Forwarding a message encloses it between two delimiter lines.  It also
modifies every line that starts with a dash, by inserting `<samp><span class="samp">-&nbsp;</span></samp>'<!-- /@w -->
at the start of the line.  When you receive a forwarded message, if it
contains something besides ordinary text&mdash;for example, program source
code&mdash;you might find it useful to undo that transformation.  You can do
this by selecting the forwarded message and typing <kbd>M-x
unforward-rmail-message</kbd>.  This command extracts the original forwarded
message, deleting the inserted `<samp><span class="samp">-&nbsp;</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> strings, and inserts it
into the Rmail file as a separate message immediately following the
current one.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dresend-2845"></a>  <dfn>Resending</dfn> is an alternative similar to forwarding; the
difference is that resending sends a message that is &ldquo;from&rdquo; the
original sender, just as it reached you&mdash;with a few added header fields
(`<samp><span class="samp">Resent-From</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">Resent-To</span></samp>') to indicate that it came via
you.  To resend a message in Rmail, use <kbd>C-u f</kbd>.  (<kbd>f</kbd> runs
<code>rmail-forward</code>, which invokes <code>rmail-resend</code> if you provide a
numeric argument.)

   <p><a name="index-m-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-2846"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dmail-2847"></a>  Use the <kbd>m</kbd> (<code>rmail-mail</code>) command to start editing an
outgoing message that is not a reply.  It leaves the header fields empty. 
Its only difference from <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd> is that it makes the Rmail buffer
accessible for <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd>, just as <kbd>r</kbd> does.  Thus, <kbd>m</kbd> can be
used to reply to or forward a message; it can do anything <kbd>r</kbd> or <kbd>f</kbd>
can do.

   <p><a name="index-c-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-2848"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dcontinue-2849"></a>  The <kbd>c</kbd> (<code>rmail-continue</code>) command resumes editing the
`<samp><span class="samp">*mail*</span></samp>' buffer, to finish editing an outgoing message you were
already composing, or to alter a message you have sent.

   <p><a name="index-rmail_002dmail_002dnew_002dframe-2850"></a>  If you set the variable <code>rmail-mail-new-frame</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, then all the Rmail commands to start sending a
message create a new frame to edit it in.  This frame is deleted when
you send the message, or when you use the `<samp><span class="samp">Cancel</span></samp>' item in the
`<samp><span class="samp">Mail</span></samp>' menu.

   <p>All the Rmail commands to send a message use the mail-composition
method that you have chosen (see <a href="Mail-Methods.html#Mail-Methods">Mail Methods</a>).
