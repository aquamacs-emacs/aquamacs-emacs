<h3 class="section">31.11 Running an External Lisp</h3>

<p>Emacs has facilities for running programs in other Lisp systems.  You can
run a Lisp process as an inferior of Emacs, and pass expressions to it to
be evaluated.  You can also pass changed function definitions directly from
the Emacs buffers in which you edit the Lisp programs to the inferior Lisp
process.

   <p><a name="index-run_002dlisp-2409"></a><a name="index-inferior_002dlisp_002dprogram-2410"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dz-2411"></a>  To run an inferior Lisp process, type <kbd>M-x run-lisp</kbd>.  This runs
the program named <code>lisp</code>, the same program you would run by typing
<code>lisp</code> as a shell command, with both input and output going through
an Emacs buffer named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*lisp*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  That is to say, any &ldquo;terminal
output&rdquo; from Lisp will go into the buffer, advancing point, and any
&ldquo;terminal input&rdquo; for Lisp comes from text in the buffer.  (You can
change the name of the Lisp executable file by setting the variable
<code>inferior-lisp-program</code>.)

   <p>To give input to Lisp, go to the end of the buffer and type the input,
terminated by &lt;RET&gt;.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*lisp*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer is in Inferior Lisp
mode, which combines the special characteristics of Lisp mode with most
of the features of Shell mode (see <a href="Shell-Mode.html#Shell-Mode">Shell Mode</a>).  The definition of
&lt;RET&gt; to send a line to a subprocess is one of the features of Shell
mode.

   <p><a name="index-lisp_002dmode-2412"></a>  For the source files of programs to run in external Lisps, use Lisp
mode.  You can switch to this mode with <kbd>M-x lisp-mode</kbd>, and it is
used automatically for files whose names end in <samp><span class="file">.l</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">.lsp</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="file">.lisp</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dx-_0040r_007b_0028Lisp-mode_0029_007d-2413"></a><a name="index-lisp_002deval_002ddefun-2414"></a>  When you edit a function in a Lisp program you are running, the easiest
way to send the changed definition to the inferior Lisp process is the key
<kbd>C-M-x</kbd>.  In Lisp mode, this runs the function <code>lisp-eval-defun</code>,
which finds the defun around or following point and sends it as input to
the Lisp process.  (Emacs can send input to any inferior process regardless
of what buffer is current.)

   <p>Contrast the meanings of <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> in Lisp mode (for editing
programs to be run in another Lisp system) and Emacs-Lisp mode (for
editing Lisp programs to be run in Emacs; see see <a href="Lisp-Eval.html#Lisp-Eval">Lisp Eval</a>): in
both modes it has the effect of installing the function definition
that point is in, but the way of doing so is different according to
where the relevant Lisp environment is found.
