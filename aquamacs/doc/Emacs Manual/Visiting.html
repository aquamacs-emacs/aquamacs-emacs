   <p><a name="index-files_002c-visiting-and-saving-815"></a><a name="index-saving-files-816"></a>  <dfn>Visiting</dfn> a file means reading its contents into an Emacs
buffer so you can edit them.  Emacs makes a new buffer for each file
that you visit.

   <p>Emacs normally constructs the buffer name from the file name,
omitting the directory name.  For example, a file named
<samp><span class="file">/usr/rms/emacs.tex</span></samp> is visited in a buffer named
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emacs.tex</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If there is already a buffer with that name, Emacs
constructs a unique name; the normal method is to append &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;2&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;3&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on, but you can select other methods. 
See <a href="Uniquify.html#Uniquify">Uniquify</a>.

   <p>Each window's mode line shows the name of the buffer that is being
displayed in that window, so you can always tell what buffer you are
editing.  see <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>.

   <p>The changes you make with editing commands are made in the Emacs
buffer.  They do not take effect in the file that you visited, or any
permanent place, until you <dfn>save</dfn> the buffer (see <a href="Saving.html#Saving">Saving</a>).

   <p><a name="index-modified-_0028buffer_0029-817"></a>  If a buffer contains changes that have not been saved, we say the
buffer is <dfn>modified</dfn>.  This implies that some changes will be lost
if the buffer is not saved.  The mode line displays two stars near the
left margin to indicate that the buffer is modified.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002df-818"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile-819"></a>  To visit a file, type <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>) and use the
minibuffer to enter the name of the desired file.  The usual
defaulting and completion behavior is available in this minibuffer
(see <a href="Minibuffer-File.html#Minibuffer-File">Minibuffer File</a>).  Note, also, that completion ignores
certain file names (see <a href="Completion-Options.html#Completion-Options">Completion Options</a>).  While in the
minibuffer, you can abort <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> by typing <kbd>C-g</kbd>.

   <p>Your can tell that <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> has completed successfully by the
appearance of new text on the screen and a new buffer name in the mode
line.  If the specified file does not exist and you could not create
it, or exists but you can't read it, an error message is displayed in
the echo area.

   <p>If you visit a file that is already in Emacs, <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> does not make
another copy.  It selects the existing buffer containing that file. 
However, before doing so, it checks whether the file itself has changed
since you visited or saved it last.  If the file has changed, Emacs offers
to reread it.

   <p><a name="index-large_002dfile_002dwarning_002dthreshold-820"></a><a name="index-maximum-buffer-size-exceeded_002c-error-message-821"></a>  If you try to visit a file larger than
<code>large-file-warning-threshold</code> (the default is 10000000, which is
about 10 megabytes), Emacs asks you for confirmation first.  You can
answer <kbd>y</kbd> to proceed with visiting the file.  Note, however, that
Emacs cannot visit files that are larger than the maximum Emacs buffer
size, which is around 512 megabytes on 32-bit machines
(see <a href="Buffers.html#Buffers">Buffers</a>).  If you try, Emacs will display an error message
saying that the maximum buffer size has been exceeded.

   <p><a name="index-wildcard-characters-in-file-names-822"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dwildcards-823"></a>  If the file name you specify contains shell-style wildcard
characters, Emacs visits all the files that match it.  (On
case-insensitive filesystems, Emacs matches the wildcards disregarding
the letter case.)  Wildcards include &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>&rsquo; sequences.  To enter the wild card &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; in a file
name in the minibuffer, you need to type <kbd>C-q ?</kbd>.  See <a href="Quoted-File-Names.html#Quoted-File-Names">Quoted File Names</a>, for information on how to visit a file whose name
actually contains wildcard characters.  You can disable the wildcard
feature by customizing <code>find-file-wildcards</code>.

   <p><a name="index-file-selection-dialog-824"></a>  On graphical displays, there are two additional methods for visiting
files.  Firstly, when Emacs is built with a suitable GUI toolkit,
commands invoked with the mouse (by clicking on the menu bar or tool
bar) use the toolkit's standard &ldquo;File Selection&rdquo; dialog instead of
prompting for the file name in the minibuffer.  On GNU/Linux and Unix
platforms, Emacs does this when built with GTK, LessTif, and Motif
toolkits; on MS-Windows and Mac, the GUI version does that by default. 
For information on how to customize this, see <a href="Dialog-Boxes.html#Dialog-Boxes">Dialog Boxes</a>.

   <p>Secondly, Emacs supports &ldquo;drag and drop&rdquo;: dropping a file into an
ordinary Emacs window visits the file using that window.  As an
exception, dropping a file into a window displaying a Dired buffer
moves or copies the file into the displayed directory.  For details,
see <a href="Drag-and-Drop.html#Drag-and-Drop">Drag and Drop</a>, and <a href="Misc-Dired-Features.html#Misc-Dired-Features">Misc Dired Features</a>.

   <p><a name="index-creating-files-825"></a>  What if you want to create a new file?  Just visit it.  Emacs
displays &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(New file)</span></samp>&rsquo; in the echo area, but in other respects
behaves as if you had visited an existing empty file.  If you make
changes and save them, the file is created.

   <p><a name="index-minibuffer-confirmation-826"></a><a name="index-confirming-in-the-minibuffer-827"></a><a name="index-confirm_002dnonexistent_002dfile_002dor_002dbuffer-828"></a>  When &lt;TAB&gt; completion results in a nonexistent file name and you
type &lt;RET&gt; immediately to visit it, Emacs asks for confirmation;
this is because it's possible that you expected completion to go
further and give you an existing file's name.  The string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Confirm]</span></samp>&rsquo; appears for a short time after the file name to
indicate the need to confirm in this way.  Type &lt;RET&gt; to confirm
and visit the nonexistent file.  The variable
<code>confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer</code> controls whether Emacs asks
for confirmation before visiting a new file.  The default value,
<code>after-completion</code>, gives the behavior we have just described. 
If the value is <code>nil</code>, Emacs never asks for confirmation; for any
other non-<code>nil</code> value, Emacs always asks for confirmation.  This
variable also affects the <code>switch-to-buffer</code> command
(see <a href="Select-Buffer.html#Select-Buffer">Select Buffer</a>).  See <a href="Completion.html#Completion">Completion</a>, for more information
about completion.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dv-829"></a><a name="index-find_002dalternate_002dfile-830"></a>  If you visit a nonexistent file unintentionally (because you typed
the wrong file name), type <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> (<code>find-alternate-file</code>)
to visit the file you really wanted.  <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> is similar to
<kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, but it kills the current buffer (after first offering
to save it if it is modified).  When <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> reads the file name
to visit, it inserts the entire default file name in the buffer, with
point just after the directory part; this is convenient if you made a
slight error in typing the name.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002drun_002ddired-831"></a>  If you &ldquo;visit&rdquo; a file that is actually a directory, Emacs invokes
Dired, the Emacs directory browser; this lets you &ldquo;edit&rdquo; the
contents of the directory.  See <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>.  You can disable this
behavior by setting the variable <code>find-file-run-dired</code> to
<code>nil</code>; in that case, it is an error to try to visit a directory.

   <p>Files which are actually collections of other files, or <dfn>file
archives</dfn>, are visited in special modes which invoke a Dired-like
environment to allow operations on archive members.  See <a href="File-Archives.html#File-Archives">File Archives</a>, for more about these features.

   <p>If you visit a file that the operating system won't let you modify,
or that is marked read-only, Emacs makes the buffer read-only too, so
that you won't go ahead and make changes that you'll have trouble
saving afterward.  You can make the buffer writable with <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd>
(<code>toggle-read-only</code>).  See <a href="Misc-Buffer.html#Misc-Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dr-832"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dread_002donly-833"></a>  If you want to visit a file as read-only in order to protect
yourself from entering changes accidentally, visit it with the command
<kbd>C-x C-r</kbd> (<code>find-file-read-only</code>) instead of <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-4-f-834"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dother_002dwindow-835"></a>  <kbd>C-x 4 f</kbd> (<code>find-file-other-window</code>) is like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>
except that the buffer containing the specified file is selected in another
window.  The window that was selected before <kbd>C-x 4 f</kbd> continues to
show the same buffer it was already showing.  If this command is used when
only one window is being displayed, that window is split in two, with one
window showing the same buffer as before, and the other one showing the
newly requested file.  See <a href="Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-5-f-836"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dother_002dframe-837"></a>  <kbd>C-x 5 f</kbd> (<code>find-file-other-frame</code>) is similar, but opens a
new frame, or makes visible any existing frame showing the file you
seek.  This feature is available only when you are using a window
system.  See <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>.

   <p>Emacs recognizes from the contents of a file which end-of-line
convention it uses to separate lines&mdash;newline (used on GNU/Linux and
on Unix), carriage-return linefeed (used on Microsoft systems), or
just carriage-return (used on the Macintosh)&mdash;and automatically
converts the contents to the normal Emacs convention, which is that
the newline character separates lines.  This is a part of the general
feature of coding system conversion (see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>), and
makes it possible to edit files imported from different operating
systems with equal convenience.  If you change the text and save the
file, Emacs performs the inverse conversion, changing newlines back
into carriage-return linefeed or just carriage-return if appropriate.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dliterally-838"></a>  If you wish to edit a file as a sequence of <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters with no special encoding or conversion, use the <kbd>M-x
find-file-literally</kbd> command.  This visits a file, like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>,
but does not do format conversion (see <a href="Formatted-Text.html#Formatted-Text">Formatted Text</a>), character
code conversion (see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>), or automatic uncompression
(see <a href="Compressed-Files.html#Compressed-Files">Compressed Files</a>), and does not add a final newline because
of <code>require-final-newline</code> (see <a href="Customize-Save.html#Customize-Save">Customize Save</a>).  If you have
already visited the same file in the usual (non-literal) manner, this
command asks you whether to visit it literally instead.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dhook-839"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dnot_002dfound_002dfunctions-840"></a>  Two special hook variables allow extensions to modify the operation of
visiting files.  Visiting a file that does not exist runs the functions
in the list <code>find-file-not-found-functions</code>; this variable holds a list
of functions, and the functions are called one by one (with no
arguments) until one of them returns non-<code>nil</code>.  This is not a
normal hook, and the name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-functions</span></samp>&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>&rsquo;
to indicate that fact.

   <p>Successful visiting of any file, whether existing or not, calls the
functions in the list <code>find-file-hook</code>, with no arguments. 
This variable is a normal hook.  In the case of a nonexistent file, the
<code>find-file-not-found-functions</code> are run first.  See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

   <p>There are several ways to specify automatically the major mode for
editing the file (see <a href="Choosing-Modes.html#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>), and to specify local
variables defined for that file (see <a href="File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).
