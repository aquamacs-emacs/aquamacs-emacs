<h3 class="section">32.25 Atomic Change Groups</h3>

<p><a name="index-atomic-changes-2757"></a>
  In data base terminology, an <dfn>atomic</dfn> change is an indivisible
change&mdash;it can succeed entirely or it can fail entirely, but it
cannot partly succeed.  A Lisp program can make a series of changes to
one or several buffers as an <dfn>atomic change group</dfn>, meaning that
either the entire series of changes will be installed in their buffers
or, in case of an error, none of them will be.

   <p>To do this for one buffer, the one already current, simply write a
call to <code>atomic-change-group</code> around the code that makes the
changes, like this:

<pre class="example">     (atomic-change-group
       (insert foo)
       (delete-region x y))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If an error (or other nonlocal exit) occurs inside the body of
<code>atomic-change-group</code>, it unmakes all the changes in that buffer
that were during the execution of the body.  This kind of change group
has no effect on any other buffers&mdash;any such changes remain.

   <p>If you need something more sophisticated, such as to make changes in
various buffers constitute one atomic group, you must directly call
lower-level functions that <code>atomic-change-group</code> uses.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>prepare-change-group</b><var> &amp;optional buffer<a name="index-prepare_002dchange_002dgroup-2758"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets up a change group for buffer <var>buffer</var>, which
defaults to the current buffer.  It returns a &ldquo;handle&rdquo; that
represents the change group.  You must use this handle to activate the
change group and subsequently to finish it. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>To use the change group, you must <dfn>activate</dfn> it.  You must do
this before making any changes in the text of <var>buffer</var>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>activate-change-group</b><var> handle<a name="index-activate_002dchange_002dgroup-2759"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function activates the change group that <var>handle</var> designates. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>After you activate the change group, any changes you make in that
buffer become part of it.  Once you have made all the desired changes
in the buffer, you must <dfn>finish</dfn> the change group.  There are two
ways to do this: you can either accept (and finalize) all the changes,
or cancel them all.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>accept-change-group</b><var> handle<a name="index-accept_002dchange_002dgroup-2760"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function accepts all the changes in the change group specified by
<var>handle</var>, making them final. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>cancel-change-group</b><var> handle<a name="index-cancel_002dchange_002dgroup-2761"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function cancels and undoes all the changes in the change group
specified by <var>handle</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Your code should use <code>unwind-protect</code> to make sure the group is
always finished.  The call to <code>activate-change-group</code> should be
inside the <code>unwind-protect</code>, in case the user types <kbd>C-g</kbd>
just after it runs.  (This is one reason why
<code>prepare-change-group</code> and <code>activate-change-group</code> are
separate functions, because normally you would call
<code>prepare-change-group</code> before the start of that
<code>unwind-protect</code>.)  Once you finish the group, don't use the
handle again&mdash;in particular, don't try to finish the same group
twice.

   <p>To make a multibuffer change group, call <code>prepare-change-group</code>
once for each buffer you want to cover, then use <code>nconc</code> to
combine the returned values, like this:

<pre class="example">     (nconc (prepare-change-group buffer-1)
            (prepare-change-group buffer-2))
</pre>
   <p>You can then activate the multibuffer change group with a single call
to <code>activate-change-group</code>, and finish it with a single call to
<code>accept-change-group</code> or <code>cancel-change-group</code>.

   <p>Nested use of several change groups for the same buffer works as you
would expect.  Non-nested use of change groups for the same buffer
will get Emacs confused, so don't let it happen; the first change
group you start for any given buffer should be the last one finished.
