<h3 class="section">19.1 Introduction to Reading and Printing</h3>

<p><a name="index-Lisp-reader-1024"></a><a name="index-printing-1025"></a><a name="index-reading-1026"></a>
  <dfn>Reading</dfn> a Lisp object means parsing a Lisp expression in textual
form and producing a corresponding Lisp object.  This is how Lisp
programs get into Lisp from files of Lisp code.  We call the text the
<dfn>read syntax</dfn> of the object.  For example, the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a . 5)</span></samp>&rsquo;
is the read syntax for a cons cell whose <span class="sc">car</span> is <code>a</code> and whose
<span class="sc">cdr</span> is the number 5.

   <p><dfn>Printing</dfn> a Lisp object means producing text that represents that
object&mdash;converting the object to its <dfn>printed representation</dfn>
(see <a href="Printed-Representation.html#Printed-Representation">Printed Representation</a>).  Printing the cons cell described
above produces the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a . 5)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Reading and printing are more or less inverse operations: printing the
object that results from reading a given piece of text often produces
the same text, and reading the text that results from printing an object
usually produces a similar-looking object.  For example, printing the
symbol <code>foo</code> produces the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;, and reading that text
returns the symbol <code>foo</code>.  Printing a list whose elements are
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> produces the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a b)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and reading that
text produces a list (but not the same list) with elements <code>a</code>
and <code>b</code>.

   <p>However, these two operations are not precisely inverse to each other. 
There are three kinds of exceptions:

     <ul>
<li>Printing can produce text that cannot be read.  For example, buffers,
windows, frames, subprocesses and markers print as text that starts
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;; if you try to read this text, you get an error.  There is
no way to read those data types.

     <li>One object can have multiple textual representations.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">01</span></samp>&rsquo; represent the same integer, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a b)</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a . (b))</span></samp>&rsquo; represent the same list.  Reading will accept any of
the alternatives, but printing must choose one of them.

     <li>Comments can appear at certain points in the middle of an object's
read sequence without affecting the result of reading it. 
</ul>
