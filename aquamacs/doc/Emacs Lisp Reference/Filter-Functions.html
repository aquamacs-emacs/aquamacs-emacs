<h4 class="subsection">37.9.2 Process Filter Functions</h4>

<p><a name="index-filter-function-3250"></a><a name="index-process-filter-3251"></a>
  A process <dfn>filter function</dfn> is a function that receives the
standard output from the associated process.  If a process has a filter,
then <em>all</em> output from that process is passed to the filter.  The
process buffer is used directly for output from the process only when
there is no filter.

   <p>The filter function can only be called when Emacs is waiting for
something, because process output arrives only at such times.  Emacs
waits when reading terminal input, in <code>sit-for</code> and
<code>sleep-for</code> (see <a href="Waiting.html#Waiting">Waiting</a>), and in <code>accept-process-output</code>
(see <a href="Accepting-Output.html#Accepting-Output">Accepting Output</a>).

   <p>A filter function must accept two arguments: the associated process
and a string, which is output just received from it.  The function is
then free to do whatever it chooses with the output.

   <p>Quitting is normally inhibited within a filter function&mdash;otherwise,
the effect of typing <kbd>C-g</kbd> at command level or to quit a user
command would be unpredictable.  If you want to permit quitting inside
a filter function, bind <code>inhibit-quit</code> to <code>nil</code>.  In most
cases, the right way to do this is with the macro
<code>with-local-quit</code>.  See <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>.

   <p>If an error happens during execution of a filter function, it is
caught automatically, so that it doesn't stop the execution of whatever
program was running when the filter function was started.  However, if
<code>debug-on-error</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the error-catching is turned
off.  This makes it possible to use the Lisp debugger to debug the
filter function.  See <a href="Debugger.html#Debugger">Debugger</a>.

   <p>Many filter functions sometimes or always insert the text in the
process's buffer, mimicking the actions of Emacs when there is no
filter.  Such filter functions need to use <code>set-buffer</code> in order to
be sure to insert in that buffer.  To avoid setting the current buffer
semipermanently, these filter functions must save and restore the
current buffer.  They should also update the process marker, and in some
cases update the value of point.  Here is how to do these things:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun ordinary-insertion-filter (proc string)
       (with-current-buffer (process-buffer proc)
         (let ((moving (= (point) (process-mark proc))))
           (save-excursion
             ;; <span class="roman">Insert the text, advancing the process marker.</span>
             (goto-char (process-mark proc))
             (insert string)
             (set-marker (process-mark proc) (point)))
           (if moving (goto-char (process-mark proc))))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The reason to use <code>with-current-buffer</code>, rather than using
<code>save-excursion</code> to save and restore the current buffer, is so as
to preserve the change in point made by the second call to
<code>goto-char</code>.

   <p>To make the filter force the process buffer to be visible whenever new
text arrives, insert the following line just before the
<code>with-current-buffer</code> construct:

<pre class="smallexample">     (display-buffer (process-buffer proc))
</pre>
   <p>To force point to the end of the new output, no matter where it was
previously, eliminate the variable <code>moving</code> and call
<code>goto-char</code> unconditionally.

   <p>In earlier Emacs versions, every filter function that did regular
expression searching or matching had to explicitly save and restore the
match data.  Now Emacs does this automatically for filter functions;
they never need to do it explicitly.  See <a href="Match-Data.html#Match-Data">Match Data</a>.

   <p>A filter function that writes the output into the buffer of the
process should check whether the buffer is still alive.  If it tries to
insert into a dead buffer, it will get an error.  The expression
<code>(buffer-name (process-buffer </code><var>process</var><code>))</code> returns <code>nil</code>
if the buffer is dead.

   <p>The output to the function may come in chunks of any size.  A program
that produces the same output twice in a row may send it as one batch of
200 characters one time, and five batches of 40 characters the next.  If
the filter looks for certain text strings in the subprocess output, make
sure to handle the case where one of these strings is split across two
or more batches of output; one way to do this is to insert the
received text into a temporary buffer, which can then be searched.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-process-filter</b><var> process filter<a name="index-set_002dprocess_002dfilter-3252"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function gives <var>process</var> the filter function <var>filter</var>.  If
<var>filter</var> is <code>nil</code>, it gives the process no filter. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>process-filter</b><var> process<a name="index-process_002dfilter-3253"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the filter function of <var>process</var>, or <code>nil</code>
if it has none. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Here is an example of use of a filter function:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun keep-output (process output)
        (setq kept (cons output kept)))
          &rArr; keep-output
     (setq kept nil)
          &rArr; nil
     (set-process-filter (get-process "shell") 'keep-output)
          &rArr; keep-output
     (process-send-string "shell" "ls ~/other\n")
          &rArr; nil
     kept
          &rArr; ("lewis@slug[8] % "
