<h3 class="section">32.4 Inserting Text</h3>

<p><a name="index-insertion-of-text-2518"></a><a name="index-text-insertion-2519"></a>
<a name="index-insertion-before-point-2520"></a><a name="index-before-point_002c-insertion-2521"></a>  <dfn>Insertion</dfn> means adding new text to a buffer.  The inserted text
goes at point&mdash;between the character before point and the character
after point.  Some insertion functions leave point before the inserted
text, while other functions leave it after.  We call the former
insertion <dfn>after point</dfn> and the latter insertion <dfn>before point</dfn>.

   <p>Insertion relocates markers that point at positions after the
insertion point, so that they stay with the surrounding text
(see <a href="Markers.html#Markers">Markers</a>).  When a marker points at the place of insertion,
insertion may or may not relocate the marker, depending on the marker's
insertion type (see <a href="Marker-Insertion-Types.html#Marker-Insertion-Types">Marker Insertion Types</a>).  Certain special
functions such as <code>insert-before-markers</code> relocate all such markers
to point after the inserted text, regardless of the markers' insertion
type.

   <p>Insertion functions signal an error if the current buffer is
read-only or if they insert within read-only text.

   <p>These functions copy text characters from strings and buffers along
with their properties.  The inserted characters have exactly the same
properties as the characters they were copied from.  By contrast,
characters specified as separate arguments, not part of a string or
buffer, inherit their text properties from the neighboring text.

   <p>The insertion functions convert text from unibyte to multibyte in
order to insert in a multibyte buffer, and vice versa&mdash;if the text
comes from a string or from a buffer.  However, they do not convert
unibyte character codes 128 through 255 to multibyte characters, not
even if the current buffer is a multibyte buffer.  See <a href="Converting-Representations.html#Converting-Representations">Converting Representations</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>insert</b><var> &amp;rest args<a name="index-insert-2522"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function inserts the strings and/or characters <var>args</var> into the
current buffer, at point, moving point forward.  In other words, it
inserts the text before point.  An error is signaled unless all
<var>args</var> are either strings or characters.  The value is <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>insert-before-markers</b><var> &amp;rest args<a name="index-insert_002dbefore_002dmarkers-2523"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function inserts the strings and/or characters <var>args</var> into the
current buffer, at point, moving point forward.  An error is signaled
unless all <var>args</var> are either strings or characters.  The value is
<code>nil</code>.

        <p>This function is unlike the other insertion functions in that it
relocates markers initially pointing at the insertion point, to point
after the inserted text.  If an overlay begins at the insertion point,
the inserted text falls outside the overlay; if a nonempty overlay
ends at the insertion point, the inserted text falls inside that
overlay. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>insert-char</b><var> character count &amp;optional inherit<a name="index-insert_002dchar-2524"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function inserts <var>count</var> instances of <var>character</var> into the
current buffer before point.  The argument <var>count</var> should be an
integer, and <var>character</var> must be a character.  The value is <code>nil</code>.

        <p>This function does not convert unibyte character codes 128 through 255
to multibyte characters, not even if the current buffer is a multibyte
buffer.  See <a href="Converting-Representations.html#Converting-Representations">Converting Representations</a>.

        <p>If <var>inherit</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then the inserted characters inherit
sticky text properties from the two characters before and after the
insertion point.  See <a href="Sticky-Properties.html#Sticky-Properties">Sticky Properties</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>insert-buffer-substring</b><var> from-buffer-or-name &amp;optional start end<a name="index-insert_002dbuffer_002dsubstring-2525"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function inserts a portion of buffer <var>from-buffer-or-name</var>
(which must already exist) into the current buffer before point.  The
text inserted is the region between <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>.  (These
arguments default to the beginning and end of the accessible portion of
that buffer.)  This function returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>In this example, the form is executed with buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>&rsquo; as the
current buffer.  We assume that buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>&rsquo; is initially empty.

     <pre class="example">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (insert-buffer-substring "foo" 1 20)
               &rArr; nil
          
          ---------- Buffer: bar ----------
          We hold these truth-!-
          ---------- Buffer: bar ----------
</pre>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>insert-buffer-substring-no-properties</b><var> from-buffer-or-name &amp;optional start end<a name="index-insert_002dbuffer_002dsubstring_002dno_002dproperties-2526"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is like <code>insert-buffer-substring</code> except that it does not
copy any text properties. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>See <a href="Sticky-Properties.html#Sticky-Properties">Sticky Properties</a>, for other insertion functions that inherit
text properties from the nearby text in addition to inserting it. 
Whitespace inserted by indentation functions also inherits text
properties.
