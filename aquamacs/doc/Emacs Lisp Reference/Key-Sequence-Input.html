<h4 class="subsection">21.8.1 Key Sequence Input</h4>

<p><a name="index-key-sequence-input-1330"></a>
  The command loop reads input a key sequence at a time, by calling
<code>read-key-sequence</code>.  Lisp programs can also call this function;
for example, <code>describe-key</code> uses it to read the key to describe.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>read-key-sequence</b><var> prompt &amp;optional continue-echo dont-downcase-last switch-frame-ok command-loop<a name="index-read_002dkey_002dsequence-1331"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function reads a key sequence and returns it as a string or
vector.  It keeps reading events until it has accumulated a complete key
sequence; that is, enough to specify a non-prefix command using the
currently active keymaps.  (Remember that a key sequence that starts
with a mouse event is read using the keymaps of the buffer in the
window that the mouse was in, not the current buffer.)

        <p>If the events are all characters and all can fit in a string, then
<code>read-key-sequence</code> returns a string (see <a href="Strings-of-Events.html#Strings-of-Events">Strings of Events</a>). 
Otherwise, it returns a vector, since a vector can hold all kinds of
events&mdash;characters, symbols, and lists.  The elements of the string or
vector are the events in the key sequence.

        <p>Reading a key sequence includes translating the events in various
ways.  See <a href="Translation-Keymaps.html#Translation-Keymaps">Translation Keymaps</a>.

        <p>The argument <var>prompt</var> is either a string to be displayed in the
echo area as a prompt, or <code>nil</code>, meaning not to display a prompt. 
The argument <var>continue-echo</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means to echo
this key as a continuation of the previous key.

        <p>Normally any upper case event is converted to lower case if the
original event is undefined and the lower case equivalent is defined. 
The argument <var>dont-downcase-last</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means do not
convert the last event to lower case.  This is appropriate for reading
a key sequence to be defined.

        <p>The argument <var>switch-frame-ok</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means that this
function should process a <code>switch-frame</code> event if the user
switches frames before typing anything.  If the user switches frames
in the middle of a key sequence, or at the start of the sequence but
<var>switch-frame-ok</var> is <code>nil</code>, then the event will be put off
until after the current key sequence.

        <p>The argument <var>command-loop</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means that this
key sequence is being read by something that will read commands one
after another.  It should be <code>nil</code> if the caller will read just
one key sequence.

        <p>In the following example, Emacs displays the prompt &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
echo area, and then the user types <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.

     <pre class="example">          (read-key-sequence "?")
          
          ---------- Echo Area ----------
          ?<kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>
          ---------- Echo Area ----------
          
               &rArr; "^X^F"
</pre>
        <p>The function <code>read-key-sequence</code> suppresses quitting: <kbd>C-g</kbd>
typed while reading with this function works like any other character,
and does not set <code>quit-flag</code>.  See <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>.

<blockquote><p>This is like <code>read-key-sequence</code> except that it always
returns the key sequence as a vector, never as a string. 
See <a href="Strings-of-Events.html#Strings-of-Events">Strings of Events</a>.

   <p><a name="index-upper-case-key-sequence-1333"></a><a name="index-downcasing-in-_0040code_007blookup_002dkey_007d-1334"></a><a name="index-shift_002dtranslation-1335"></a>If an input character is upper-case (or has the shift modifier) and
has no key binding, but its lower-case equivalent has one, then
<code>read-key-sequence</code> converts the character to lower case.  Note
that <code>lookup-key</code> does not perform case conversion in this way.

   <p><a name="index-this_002dcommand_002dkeys_002dshift_002dtranslated-1336"></a>When reading input results in such a <dfn>shift-translation</dfn>, Emacs
sets the variable <code>this-command-keys-shift-translated</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value.  Lisp programs can examine this variable if they
need to modify their behavior when invoked by shift-translated keys. 
For example, the function <code>handle-shift-selection</code> examines the
value of this variable to determine how to activate or deactivate the
region (see <a href="The-Mark.html#The-Mark">handle-shift-selection</a>).

   <p>The function <code>read-key-sequence</code> also transforms some mouse events. 
It converts unbound drag events into click events, and discards unbound
button-down events entirely.  It also reshuffles focus events and
miscellaneous window events so that they never appear in a key sequence
with any other events.

line or a scroll bar, the event type shows nothing special&mdash;it is the
same symbol that would normally represent that combination of mouse
button and modifier keys.  The information about the window part is kept
elsewhere in the event&mdash;in the coordinates.  But
<code>read-key-sequence</code> translates this information into imaginary
&ldquo;prefix keys,&rdquo; all of which are symbols: <code>header-line</code>,
<code>horizontal-scroll-bar</code>, <code>menu-bar</code>, <code>mode-line</code>,
<code>vertical-line</code>, and <code>vertical-scroll-bar</code>.  You can define
meanings for mouse clicks in special window parts by defining key
sequences using these imaginary prefix keys.

   <p>For example, if you call <code>read-key-sequence</code> and then click the
mouse on the window's mode line, you get two events, like this:

<pre class="example">     (read-key-sequence "Click on the mode line: ")
          &rArr; [mode-line
              (mouse-1
               (#&lt;window 6 on NEWS&gt; mode-line
                (40 . 63) 5959987))]
