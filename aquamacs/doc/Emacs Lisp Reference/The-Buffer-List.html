<h3 class="section">27.8 The Buffer List</h3>

<p><a name="index-buffer-list-2010"></a>
  The <dfn>buffer list</dfn> is a list of all live buffers.  The order of the
buffers in this list is based primarily on how recently each buffer has
been displayed in a window.  Several functions, notably
<code>other-buffer</code>, use this ordering.  A buffer list displayed for the
user also follows this order.

   <p>Creating a buffer adds it to the end of the buffer list, and killing a
buffer removes it from that list.  A buffer moves to the front of this
list whenever it is chosen for display in a window (see <a href="Displaying-Buffers.html#Displaying-Buffers">Displaying Buffers</a>) or a window displaying it is selected (see <a href="Selecting-Windows.html#Selecting-Windows">Selecting Windows</a>).  A buffer moves to the end of the list when it is buried (see
<code>bury-buffer</code>, below).  There are no functions available to the
Lisp programmer which directly manipulate the buffer list.

   <p>In addition to the fundamental buffer list just described, Emacs
maintains a local buffer list for each frame, in which the buffers that
have been displayed (or had their windows selected) in that frame come
first.  (This order is recorded in the frame's <code>buffer-list</code> frame
parameter; see <a href="Buffer-Parameters.html#Buffer-Parameters">Buffer Parameters</a>.)  Buffers never displayed in
that frame come afterward, ordered according to the fundamental buffer
list.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>buffer-list</b><var> &amp;optional frame<a name="index-buffer_002dlist-2011"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the buffer list, including all buffers, even those
whose names begin with a space.  The elements are actual buffers, not
their names.

        <p>If <var>frame</var> is a frame, this returns <var>frame</var>'s local buffer list. 
If <var>frame</var> is <code>nil</code> or omitted, the fundamental buffer list is
used: the buffers appear in order of most recent display or selection,
regardless of which frames they were displayed on.

     <pre class="example">          (buffer-list)
               &rArr; (#&lt;buffer buffers.texi&gt;
                   #&lt;buffer  *Minibuf-1*&gt; #&lt;buffer buffer.c&gt;
                   #&lt;buffer *Help*&gt; #&lt;buffer TAGS&gt;)
          
          ;; <span class="roman">Note that the name of the minibuffer</span>
          ;;   <span class="roman">begins with a space!</span>
          (mapcar (function buffer-name) (buffer-list))
              &rArr; ("buffers.texi" " *Minibuf-1*"
                  "buffer.c" "*Help*" "TAGS")
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>The list returned by <code>buffer-list</code> is constructed specifically;
it is not an internal Emacs data structure, and modifying it has no
effect on the order of buffers.  If you want to change the order of
buffers in the fundamental buffer list, here is an easy way:

<pre class="example">     (defun reorder-buffer-list (new-list)
       (while new-list
         (bury-buffer (car new-list))
         (setq new-list (cdr new-list))))
</pre>
   <p>With this method, you can specify any order for the list, but there is
no danger of losing a buffer or adding something that is not a valid
live buffer.

   <p>To change the order or value of a specific frame's buffer list, set
that frame's <code>buffer-list</code> parameter with
<code>modify-frame-parameters</code> (see <a href="Parameter-Access.html#Parameter-Access">Parameter Access</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>other-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional buffer visible-ok frame<a name="index-other_002dbuffer-2012"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the first buffer in the buffer list other than
<var>buffer</var>.  Usually, this is the buffer appearing in the most
recently selected window (in frame <var>frame</var> or else the selected
frame, see <a href="Input-Focus.html#Input-Focus">Input Focus</a>), aside from <var>buffer</var>.  Buffers whose
names start with a space are not considered at all.

        <p>If <var>buffer</var> is not supplied (or if it is not a live buffer), then
<code>other-buffer</code> returns the first buffer in the selected frame's
local buffer list. (If <var>frame</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it returns the
first buffer in <var>frame</var>'s local buffer list instead.)

        <p>If <var>frame</var> has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>buffer-predicate</code> parameter,
then <code>other-buffer</code> uses that predicate to decide which buffers to
consider.  It calls the predicate once for each buffer, and if the value
is <code>nil</code>, that buffer is ignored.  See <a href="Buffer-Parameters.html#Buffer-Parameters">Buffer Parameters</a>.

     <!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
        <p>If <var>visible-ok</var> is <code>nil</code>, <code>other-buffer</code> avoids returning
a buffer visible in any window on any visible frame, except as a last
resort.  If <var>visible-ok</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then it does not matter
whether a buffer is displayed somewhere or not.

        <p>If no suitable buffer exists, the buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*scratch*</span></samp>&rsquo; is returned
(and created, if necessary). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>last-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional buffer visible-ok frame<a name="index-last_002dbuffer-2013"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the last buffer in <var>frame</var>'s buffer list other
than <var>BUFFER</var>.  If <var>frame</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it uses the
selected frame's buffer list.

        <p>The argument <var>visible-ok</var> is handled as with <code>other-buffer</code>,
see above.  If no suitable buffer can be found, the buffer
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*scratch*</span></samp>&rsquo; is returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>bury-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional buffer-or-name<a name="index-bury_002dbuffer-2014"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command puts <var>buffer-or-name</var> at the end of the buffer list,
without changing the order of any of the other buffers on the list. 
This buffer therefore becomes the least desirable candidate for
<code>other-buffer</code> to return.  The argument can be either a buffer
itself or the name of one.

        <p><code>bury-buffer</code> operates on each frame's <code>buffer-list</code> parameter
as well as the fundamental buffer list; therefore, the buffer that you
bury will come last in the value of <code>(buffer-list </code><var>frame</var><code>)</code> and
in the value of <code>(buffer-list)</code>.

        <p>If <var>buffer-or-name</var> is <code>nil</code> or omitted, this means to bury the
current buffer.  In addition, if the buffer is displayed in the selected
window, this switches to some other buffer (obtained using
<code>other-buffer</code>) in the selected window.  See <a href="Displaying-Buffers.html#Displaying-Buffers">Displaying Buffers</a>. 
But if the selected window is dedicated to its buffer, it deletes that
window if there are other windows left on its frame.  Otherwise, if the
selected window is the only window on its frame, it iconifies that
frame.  If <var>buffer-or-name</var> is displayed in some other window, it
remains displayed there.

        <p>To replace a buffer in all the windows that display it, use
<code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code>.  See <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>unbury-buffer</b><var><a name="index-unbury_002dbuffer-2015"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command switches to the last buffer in the local buffer list of the
selected frame.  More precisely, it calls the function
<code>switch-to-buffer</code> (see <a href="Displaying-Buffers.html#Displaying-Buffers">Displaying Buffers</a>), to display the
buffer returned by <code>last-buffer</code>, see above, in the selected
window.
