<h4 class="subsection">25.8.7 Standard File Names</h4>

<p>Most of the file names used in Lisp programs are entered by the user. 
But occasionally a Lisp program needs to specify a standard file name
for a particular use&mdash;typically, to hold customization information
about each user.  For example, abbrev definitions are stored (by
default) in the file <samp><span class="file">~/.abbrev_defs</span></samp>; the <code>completion</code>
package stores completions in the file <samp><span class="file">~/.completions</span></samp>.  These are
two of the many standard file names used by parts of Emacs for certain
purposes.

   <p>Various operating systems have their own conventions for valid file
names and for which file names to use for user profile data.  A Lisp
program which reads a file using a standard file name ought to use, on
each type of system, a file name suitable for that system.  The function
<code>convert-standard-filename</code> makes this easy to do.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>convert-standard-filename</b><var> filename<a name="index-convert_002dstandard_002dfilename-1874"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function alters the file name <var>filename</var> to fit the conventions
of the operating system in use, and returns the result as a new string. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The recommended way to specify a standard file name in a Lisp program
is to choose a name which fits the conventions of GNU and Unix systems,
usually with a nondirectory part that starts with a period, and pass it
to <code>convert-standard-filename</code> instead of using it directly.  Here
is an example from the <code>completion</code> package:

<pre class="example">     (defvar save-completions-file-name
             (convert-standard-filename "~/.completions")
       "*The file name to save completions to.")
</pre>
   <p>On GNU and Unix systems, and on some other systems as well,
<code>convert-standard-filename</code> returns its argument unchanged.  On
some other systems, it alters the name to fit the system's conventions.

   <p>For example, on MS-DOS the alterations made by this function include
converting a leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;  to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo;, converting a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
middle of the name to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; if there is no other &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;, inserting
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; after eight characters if there is none, and truncating to
three characters after the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (It makes other changes as well.) 
Thus, <samp><span class="file">.abbrev_defs</span></samp> becomes <samp><span class="file">_abbrev.def</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="file">.completions</span></samp> becomes <samp><span class="file">_complet.ion</span></samp>.
