<h3 class="section">28.3 Deleting Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-deleting-windows-2052"></a>
A window remains visible on its frame unless you <dfn>delete</dfn> it by
calling certain functions that delete windows.  A deleted window cannot
appear on the screen, but continues to exist as a Lisp object until
there are no references to it.  There is no way to cancel the deletion
of a window aside from restoring a saved window configuration
(see <a href="Window-Configurations.html#Window-Configurations">Window Configurations</a>).  Restoring a window configuration also
deletes any windows that aren't part of that configuration.

   <p>When you delete a window, the space it took up is given to one of
its sibling windows adjacent to it.

<!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-live-p</b><var> window<a name="index-window_002dlive_002dp-2053"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>nil</code> if <var>window</var> is deleted, and
<code>t</code> otherwise.

        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Erroneous information or fatal errors may result from
using a deleted window as if it were live. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>delete-window</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-delete_002dwindow-2054"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function removes <var>window</var> from display and returns <code>nil</code>. 
The default for <var>window</var> is the selected window.  An error is
signaled if <var>window</var> is the only window on its frame. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>delete-other-windows</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-delete_002dother_002dwindows-2055"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes <var>window</var> the only window on its frame, by
deleting the other windows in that frame.  The default for <var>window</var>
is the selected window.  The return value is <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>delete-windows-on</b><var> &amp;optional buffer-or-name frame<a name="index-delete_002dwindows_002don-2056"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function deletes all windows showing <var>buffer-or-name</var>.  If
there are no windows showing <var>buffer-or-name</var>, it does nothing.  The
optional argument <var>buffer-or-name</var> may be a buffer or the name of an
existing buffer and defaults to the current buffer.

        <p><code>delete-windows-on</code> operates frame by frame.  If a frame has
several windows showing different buffers, then those showing
<var>buffer-or-name</var> are removed, and the others expand to fill the
space.  If all windows in some frame are showing <var>buffer-or-name</var>
(including the case where there is only one window), then the frame
winds up with a single window showing another buffer chosen with
<code>other-buffer</code> (see <a href="The-Buffer-List.html#The-Buffer-List">The Buffer List</a>).  If, however, the window
showing <var>buffer-or-name</var> is dedicated to its buffer
(see <a href="Dedicated-Windows.html#Dedicated-Windows">Dedicated Windows</a>), and there are other frames left, that
window's frame is deleted.

        <p>The optional argument <var>frame</var> specifies which frames to operate on. 
This function does not use it in quite the same way as the other
functions which scan all windows; specifically, the values <code>t</code> and
<code>nil</code> have the opposite of their meanings in other functions.  Here
are the full details:

          <ul>
<li>If it is <code>nil</code>, operate on all frames. 
<li>If it is <code>t</code>, operate on the selected frame. 
<li>If it is <code>visible</code>, operate on all visible frames. 
<li>If it is 0, operate on all visible or iconified frames. 
<li>If it is a frame, operate on that frame. 
</ul>

        <p>This function always returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>
