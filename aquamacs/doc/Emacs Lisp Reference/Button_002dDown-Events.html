<h4 class="subsection">21.7.6 Button-Down Events</h4>

<p><a name="index-button_002ddown-event-1276"></a>
Click and drag events happen when the user releases a mouse button. 
They cannot happen earlier, because there is no way to distinguish a
click from a drag until the button is released.

   <p>If you want to take action as soon as a button is pressed, you need to
handle <dfn>button-down</dfn> events.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  These occur as soon as a button is
pressed.  They are represented by lists that look exactly like click
events (see <a href="Click-Events.html#Click-Events">Click Events</a>), except that the <var>event-type</var> symbol
name contains the prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">down-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">down-</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix follows
modifier key prefixes such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The function <code>read-key-sequence</code> ignores any button-down events
that don't have command bindings; therefore, the Emacs command loop
ignores them too.  This means that you need not worry about defining
button-down events unless you want them to do something.  The usual
reason to define a button-down event is so that you can track mouse
motion (by reading motion events) until the button is released. 
See <a href="Motion-Events.html#Motion-Events">Motion Events</a>.
