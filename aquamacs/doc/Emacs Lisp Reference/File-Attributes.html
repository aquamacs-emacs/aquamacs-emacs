<h4 class="subsection">25.6.4 Other Information about Files</h4>

<p>This section describes the functions for getting detailed information
about a file, other than its contents.  This information includes the
mode bits that control access permission, the owner and group numbers,
the number of names, the inode number, the size, and the times of access
and modification.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-modes</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dmodes-1805"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-permission-1806"></a><a name="index-file-attributes-1807"></a>This function returns the mode bits of <var>filename</var>, as an integer. 
The mode bits are also called the file permissions, and they specify
access control in the usual Unix fashion.  If the low-order bit is 1,
then the file is executable by all users, if the second-lowest-order bit
is 1, then the file is writable by all users, etc.

        <p>The highest value returnable is 4095 (7777 octal), meaning that
everyone has read, write, and execute permission, that the <acronym>SUID</acronym> bit
is set for both others and group, and that the sticky bit is set.

        <p>If <var>filename</var> does not exist, <code>file-modes</code> returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>This function recursively follows symbolic links at all levels.

     <pre class="example">          (file-modes "~/junk/diffs")
               &rArr; 492               ; <span class="roman">Decimal integer.</span>
          (format "%o" 492)
               &rArr; "754"             ; <span class="roman">Convert to octal.</span>
          
          (set-file-modes "~/junk/diffs" 438)
               &rArr; nil
          
          (format "%o" 438)
               &rArr; "666"             ; <span class="roman">Convert to octal.</span>
          
          % ls -l diffs
            -rw-rw-rw-  1 lewis 0 3063 Oct 30 16:00 diffs
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>If the <var>filename</var> argument to the next two functions is a symbolic
link, then these function do <em>not</em> replace it with its target. 
However, they both recursively follow symbolic links at all levels of
parent directories.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-nlinks</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dnlinks-1808"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This functions returns the number of names (i.e., hard links) that
file <var>filename</var> has.  If the file does not exist, then this function
returns <code>nil</code>.  Note that symbolic links have no effect on this
function, because they are not considered to be names of the files they
link to.

     <pre class="example">          % ls -l foo*
          -rw-rw-rw-  2 rms       4 Aug 19 01:27 foo
          -rw-rw-rw-  2 rms       4 Aug 19 01:27 foo1
          
          (file-nlinks "foo")
               &rArr; 2
          (file-nlinks "doesnt-exist")
               &rArr; nil
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-attributes</b><var> filename &amp;optional id-format<a name="index-file_002dattributes-1809"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-file_002dattributes"></a>This function returns a list of attributes of file <var>filename</var>.  If
the specified file cannot be opened, it returns <code>nil</code>. 
The optional parameter <var>id-format</var> specifies the preferred format
of attributes <acronym>UID</acronym> and <acronym>GID</acronym> (see below)&mdash;the
valid values are <code>'string</code> and <code>'integer</code>.  The latter is
the default, but we plan to change that, so you should specify a
non-<code>nil</code> value for <var>id-format</var> if you use the returned
<acronym>UID</acronym> or <acronym>GID</acronym>.

        <p>The elements of the list, in order, are:

          <ol type=1 start=0>
<li><code>t</code> for a directory, a string for a symbolic link (the name
linked to), or <code>nil</code> for a text file.

          <!-- Wordy so as to prevent an overfull hbox.  -rjc 15mar92 -->
          <li>The number of names the file has.  Alternate names, also known as hard
links, can be created by using the <code>add-name-to-file</code> function
(see <a href="Changing-Files.html#Changing-Files">Changing Files</a>).

          <li>The file's <acronym>UID</acronym>, normally as a string.  However, if it does
not correspond to a named user, the value is an integer or a floating
point number.

          <li>The file's <acronym>GID</acronym>, likewise.

          <li>The time of last access, as a list of two integers. 
The first integer has the high-order 16 bits of time,
the second has the low 16 bits.  (This is similar to the
value of <code>current-time</code>; see <a href="Time-of-Day.html#Time-of-Day">Time of Day</a>.)  Note that on
some FAT-based filesystems, only the date of last access is recorded,
so this time will always hold the midnight of the day of last access.

          <p><a name="index-modification-time-of-file-1810"></a><li>The time of last modification as a list of two integers (as above). 
This is the last time when the file's contents were modified.

          <li>The time of last status change as a list of two integers (as above). 
This is the time of the last change to the file's access mode bits,
its owner and group, and other information recorded in the filesystem
for the file, beyond the file's contents.

          <li>The size of the file in bytes.  If the size is too large to fit in a
Lisp integer, this is a floating point number.

          <li>The file's modes, as a string of ten letters or dashes,
as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls -l</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <li><code>t</code> if the file's <acronym>GID</acronym> would change if file were
deleted and recreated; <code>nil</code> otherwise.

          <li>The file's inode number.  If possible, this is an integer.  If the
inode number is too large to be represented as an integer in Emacs
Lisp, but still fits into a 32-bit integer, then the value has the
form <code>(</code><var>high</var><code> . </code><var>low</var><code>)</code>, where <var>low</var> holds the low 16
bits.  If the inode is wider than 32 bits, the value is of the form
<code>(</code><var>high</var> <var>middle</var><code> . </code><var>low</var><code>)</code>, where <code>high</code> holds
the high 24 bits, <var>middle</var> the next 24 bits, and <var>low</var> the low
16 bits.

          <li>The filesystem number of the device that the file is on.  Depending on
the magnitude of the value, this can be either an integer or a cons
cell, in the same manner as the inode number.  This element and the
file's inode number together give enough information to distinguish
any two files on the system&mdash;no two files can have the same values
for both of these numbers.
             </ol>

        <p>For example, here are the file attributes for <samp><span class="file">files.texi</span></samp>:

     <pre class="example">          (file-attributes "files.texi" 'string)
               &rArr;  (nil 1 "lh" "users"
                    (19145 42977)
                    (19141 59576)
                    (18340 17300)
                    122295 "-rw-rw-rw-"
                    nil  (5888 2 . 43978)
                    (15479 . 46724))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">and here is how the result is interpreted:

          <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>is neither a directory nor a symbolic link.

          <br><dt><code>1</code><dd>has only one name (the name <samp><span class="file">files.texi</span></samp> in the current default
directory).

          <br><dt><code>"lh"</code><dd>is owned by the user with name "lh".

          <br><dt><code>"users"</code><dd>is in the group with name "users".

          <br><dt><code>(19145 42977)</code><dd>was last accessed on Oct 5 2009, at 10:01:37.

          <br><dt><code>(19141 59576)</code><dd>last had its contents modified on Oct 2 2009, at 13:49:12.

          <br><dt><code>(18340 17300)</code><dd>last had its status changed on Feb 2 2008, at 12:19:00.

          <br><dt><code>122295</code><dd>is 122295 bytes long.  (It may not contain 122295 characters, though,
if some of the bytes belong to multibyte sequences, and also if the
end-of-line format is CR-LF.)

          <br><dt><code>"-rw-rw-rw-"</code><dd>has a mode of read and write access for the owner, group, and world.

          <br><dt><code>nil</code><dd>would retain the same <acronym>GID</acronym> if it were recreated.

          <br><dt><code>(5888 2 . 43978)</code><dd>has an inode number of 6473924464520138.

          <br><dt><code>(15479 . 46724)</code><dd>is on the file-system device whose number is 1014478468. 
</dl>
        </p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-MS_002dDOS-and-file-modes-1811"></a><a name="index-file-modes-and-MS_002dDOS-1812"></a>  On MS-DOS, there is no such thing as an &ldquo;executable&rdquo; file mode bit. 
So Emacs considers a file executable if its name ends in one of the
standard executable extensions, such as <samp><span class="file">.com</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.bat</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">.exe</span></samp>, and some others.  Files that begin with the Unix-standard
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#!</span></samp>&rsquo; signature, such as shell and Perl scripts, are also considered
as executable files.  This is reflected in the values returned by
<code>file-modes</code> and <code>file-attributes</code>.  Directories are also
reported with executable bit set, for compatibility with Unix.
