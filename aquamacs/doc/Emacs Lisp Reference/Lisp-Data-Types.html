<h2 class="chapter">2 Lisp Data Types</h2>

<p><a name="index-object-37"></a><a name="index-Lisp-object-38"></a><a name="index-type-39"></a><a name="index-data-type-40"></a>
  A Lisp <dfn>object</dfn> is a piece of data used and manipulated by Lisp
programs.  For our purposes, a <dfn>type</dfn> or <dfn>data type</dfn> is a set of
possible objects.

   <p>Every object belongs to at least one type.  Objects of the same type
have similar structures and may usually be used in the same contexts. 
Types can overlap, and objects can belong to two or more types. 
Consequently, we can ask whether an object belongs to a particular type,
but not for &ldquo;the&rdquo; type of an object.

   <p><a name="index-primitive-type-41"></a>  A few fundamental object types are built into Emacs.  These, from
which all other types are constructed, are called <dfn>primitive types</dfn>. 
Each object belongs to one and only one primitive type.  These types
include <dfn>integer</dfn>, <dfn>float</dfn>, <dfn>cons</dfn>, <dfn>symbol</dfn>,
<dfn>string</dfn>, <dfn>vector</dfn>, <dfn>hash-table</dfn>, <dfn>subr</dfn>, and
<dfn>byte-code function</dfn>, plus several special types, such as
<dfn>buffer</dfn>, that are related to editing.  (See <a href="Editing-Types.html#Editing-Types">Editing Types</a>.)

   <p>Each primitive type has a corresponding Lisp function that checks
whether an object is a member of that type.

   <p>Lisp is unlike many other languages in that its objects are
<dfn>self-typing</dfn>: the primitive type of each object is implicit in
the object itself.  For example, if an object is a vector, nothing can
treat it as a number; Lisp knows it is a vector, not a number.

   <p>In most languages, the programmer must declare the data type of each
variable, and the type is known by the compiler but not represented in
the data.  Such type declarations do not exist in Emacs Lisp.  A Lisp
variable can have any type of value, and it remembers whatever value
you store in it, type and all.  (Actually, a small number of Emacs
Lisp variables can only take on values of a certain type. 
See <a href="Variables-with-Restricted-Values.html#Variables-with-Restricted-Values">Variables with Restricted Values</a>.)

   <p>This chapter describes the purpose, printed representation, and read
syntax of each of the standard types in GNU Emacs Lisp.  Details on how
to use these types can be found in later chapters.
