<h4 class="subsection">21.7.4 Click Events</h4>

<p><a name="index-click-event-1272"></a><a name="index-mouse-click-event-1273"></a>
When the user presses a mouse button and releases it at the same
location, that generates a <dfn>click</dfn> event.  All mouse click event
share the same format:

<pre class="example">     (<var>event-type</var> <var>position</var> <var>click-count</var>)
</pre>
     <dl>
<dt><var>event-type</var><dd>This is a symbol that indicates which mouse button was used.  It is
one of the symbols <code>mouse-1</code>, <code>mouse-2</code>, <small class="dots">...</small>, where the
buttons are numbered left to right.

     <p>You can also use prefixes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">H-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S-</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s-</span></samp>&rsquo; for modifiers alt, control, hyper, meta, shift
and super, just as you would with function keys.

     <p>This symbol also serves as the event type of the event.  Key bindings
describe events by their types; thus, if there is a key binding for
<code>mouse-1</code>, that binding would apply to all events whose
<var>event-type</var> is <code>mouse-1</code>.

     <br><dt><var>position</var><dd>This is the position where the mouse click occurred.  The actual
format of <var>position</var> depends on what part of a window was clicked
on.

     <p>For mouse click events in the text area, mode line, header line, or in
the marginal areas, <var>position</var> has this form:

     <pre class="example">          (<var>window</var> <var>pos-or-area</var> (<var>x</var> . <var>y</var>) <var>timestamp</var>
           <var>object</var> <var>text-pos</var> (<var>col</var> . <var>row</var>)
           <var>image</var> (<var>dx</var> . <var>dy</var>) (<var>width</var> . <var>height</var>))
</pre>
          <dl>
<dt><var>window</var><dd>This is the window in which the click occurred.

          <br><dt><var>pos-or-area</var><dd>This is the buffer position of the character clicked on in the text
area, or if clicked outside the text area, it is the window area in
which the click occurred.  It is one of the symbols <code>mode-line</code>,
<code>header-line</code>, <code>vertical-line</code>, <code>left-margin</code>,
<code>right-margin</code>, <code>left-fringe</code>, or <code>right-fringe</code>.

          <p>In one special case, <var>pos-or-area</var> is a list containing a symbol (one
of the symbols listed above) instead of just the symbol.  This happens
after the imaginary prefix keys for the event are inserted into the
input stream.  See <a href="Key-Sequence-Input.html#Key-Sequence-Input">Key Sequence Input</a>.

          <br><dt><var>x</var>, <var>y</var><dd>These are the pixel coordinates of the click, relative to
the top left corner of <var>window</var>, which is <code>(0 . 0)</code>. 
For the mode or header line, <var>y</var> does not have meaningful data. 
For the vertical line, <var>x</var> does not have meaningful data.

          <br><dt><var>timestamp</var><dd>This is the time at which the event occurred, in milliseconds.

          <br><dt><var>object</var><dd>This is the object on which the click occurred.  It is either
<code>nil</code> if there is no string property, or it has the form
(<var>string</var> . <var>string-pos</var>) when there is a string-type text
property at the click position.

               <dl>
<dt><var>string</var><dd>This is the string on which the click occurred, including any
properties.

               <br><dt><var>string-pos</var><dd>This is the position in the string on which the click occurred,
relevant if properties at the click need to be looked up. 
</dl>

          <br><dt><var>text-pos</var><dd>For clicks on a marginal area or on a fringe, this is the buffer
position of the first visible character in the corresponding line in
the window.  For other events, it is the current buffer position in
the window.

          <br><dt><var>col</var>, <var>row</var><dd>These are the actual coordinates of the glyph under the <var>x</var>,
<var>y</var> position, possibly padded with default character width
glyphs if <var>x</var> is beyond the last glyph on the line.

          <br><dt><var>image</var><dd>This is the image object on which the click occurred.  It is either
<code>nil</code> if there is no image at the position clicked on, or it is
an image object as returned by <code>find-image</code> if click was in an image.

          <br><dt><var>dx</var>, <var>dy</var><dd>These are the pixel coordinates of the click, relative to
the top left corner of <var>object</var>, which is <code>(0 . 0)</code>.  If
<var>object</var> is <code>nil</code>, the coordinates are relative to the top
left corner of the character glyph clicked on.

          <br><dt><var>width</var>, <var>height</var><dd>These are the pixel width and height of <var>object</var> or, if this is
<code>nil</code>, those of the character glyph clicked on. 
</dl>

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     For mouse clicks on a scroll-bar, <var>position</var> has this form:

     <pre class="example">          (<var>window</var> <var>area</var> (<var>portion</var> . <var>whole</var>) <var>timestamp</var> <var>part</var>)
</pre>
          <dl>
<dt><var>window</var><dd>This is the window whose scroll-bar was clicked on.

          <br><dt><var>area</var><dd>This is the scroll bar where the click occurred.  It is one of the
symbols <code>vertical-scroll-bar</code> or <code>horizontal-scroll-bar</code>.

          <br><dt><var>portion</var><dd>This is the distance of the click from the top or left end of
the scroll bar.

          <br><dt><var>whole</var><dd>This is the length of the entire scroll bar.

          <br><dt><var>timestamp</var><dd>This is the time at which the event occurred, in milliseconds.

          <br><dt><var>part</var><dd>This is the part of the scroll-bar which was clicked on.  It is one
of the symbols <code>above-handle</code>, <code>handle</code>, <code>below-handle</code>,
<code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>end-scroll</code>. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><var>click-count</var><dd>This is the number of rapid repeated presses so far of the same mouse
button.  See <a href="Repeat-Events.html#Repeat-Events">Repeat Events</a>. 
</dl>
