<h4 class="subsection">20.6.7 Programmed Completion</h4>

<p><a name="index-programmed-completion-1159"></a>
  Sometimes it is not possible to create an alist or an obarray
containing all the intended possible completions.  In such a case, you
can supply your own function to compute the completion of a given
string.  This is called <dfn>programmed completion</dfn>.  Emacs uses
programmed completion when completing file names (see <a href="File-Name-Completion.html#File-Name-Completion">File Name Completion</a>), among many other cases.

   <p>To use this feature, pass a function as the <var>collection</var>
argument to <code>completing-read</code>.  The function
<code>completing-read</code> arranges to pass your completion function along
to <code>try-completion</code>, <code>all-completions</code>, and other basic
completion functions, which will then let your function do all
the work.

   <p>The completion function should accept three arguments:

     <ul>
<li>The string to be completed.

     <li>The predicate function to filter possible matches, or <code>nil</code> if
none.  Your function should call the predicate for each possible match,
and ignore the possible match if the predicate returns <code>nil</code>.

     <li>A flag specifying the type of operation.  The best way to think about
it is that the function stands for an object (in the
&ldquo;object-oriented&rdquo; sense of the word), and this third argument
specifies which method to run. 
</ul>

   <p>There are currently four methods, i.e. four flag values, one for
  each of the four different basic operations:

     <ul>
<li><code>nil</code> specifies <code>try-completion</code>.  The completion function
should return the completion of the specified string, or <code>t</code> if the
string is a unique and exact match already, or <code>nil</code> if the string
matches no possibility.

     <p>If the string is an exact match for one possibility, but also matches
other longer possibilities, the function should return the string, not
<code>t</code>.

     <li><code>t</code> specifies <code>all-completions</code>.  The completion function
should return a list of all possible completions of the specified
string.

     <li><code>lambda</code> specifies <code>test-completion</code>.  The completion
function should return <code>t</code> if the specified string is an exact
match for some possibility; <code>nil</code> otherwise.

     <li><code>(boundaries . SUFFIX)</code> specifies <code>completion-boundaries</code>. 
The function should return a value of the form <code>(boundaries
START . END)</code> where START is the position of the beginning boundary in
in the string to complete, and END is the position of the end boundary
in SUFFIX. 
</ul>

   <p>It would be consistent and clean for completion functions to allow
lambda expressions (lists that are functions) as well as function
symbols as <var>collection</var>, but this is impossible.  Lists as
completion tables already have other meanings, and it would be
unreliable to treat one differently just because it is also a possible
function.  So you must arrange for any function you wish to use for
completion to be encapsulated in a symbol.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>completion-table-dynamic</b><var> function<a name="index-completion_002dtable_002ddynamic-1160"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is a convenient way to write a function that can act as
programmed completion function.  The argument <var>function</var> should be
a function that takes one argument, a string, and returns an alist of
possible completions of it.  You can think of
<code>completion-table-dynamic</code> as a transducer between that interface
and the interface for programmed completion functions. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>completion-annotate-function</b><var><a name="index-completion_002dannotate_002dfunction-1161"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable, if non-<code>nil</code>, should be a function
for &ldquo;annotating&rdquo; the entries in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Completions*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer. 
The function should accept a single argument, the completion string
for an entry.  It should return an additional string to display next
to that entry in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Completions*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, or <code>nil</code> if no
additional string is to be displayed.

        <p>The function can determine the collection used for the current
completion via the variable <code>minibuffer-completion-table</code>
(see <a href="Completion-Commands.html#Completion-Commands">Completion Commands</a>).
