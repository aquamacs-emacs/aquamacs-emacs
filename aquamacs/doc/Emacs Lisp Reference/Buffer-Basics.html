<h3 class="section">27.1 Buffer Basics</h3>

<p>A <dfn>buffer</dfn> is a Lisp object containing text to be edited.  Buffers
are used to hold the contents of files that are being visited; there may
also be buffers that are not visiting files.  Although several buffers
normally exist, only one buffer is designated the <dfn>current
buffer</dfn> at any time.  Most editing commands act on the contents of the
current buffer.  Each buffer, including the current buffer, may or may
not be displayed in any windows.

<p>Buffers in Emacs editing are objects that have distinct names and hold
text that can be edited.  Buffers appear to Lisp programs as a special
data type.  You can think of the contents of a buffer as a string that
you can extend; insertions and deletions may occur in any part of the
buffer.  See <a href="Text.html#Text">Text</a>.

   <p>A Lisp buffer object contains numerous pieces of information.  Some of
this information is directly accessible to the programmer through
variables, while other information is accessible only through
special-purpose functions.  For example, the visited file name is
directly accessible through a variable, while the value of point is
accessible only through a primitive function.

   <p>Buffer-specific information that is directly accessible is stored in
<dfn>buffer-local</dfn> variable bindings, which are variable values that are
effective only in a particular buffer.  This feature allows each buffer
to override the values of certain variables.  Most major modes override
variables such as <code>fill-column</code> or <code>comment-column</code> in this
way.  For more information about buffer-local variables and functions
related to them, see <a href="Buffer_002dLocal-Variables.html#Buffer_002dLocal-Variables">Buffer-Local Variables</a>.

   <p>For functions and variables related to visiting files in buffers, see
<a href="Visiting-Files.html#Visiting-Files">Visiting Files</a> and <a href="Saving-Buffers.html#Saving-Buffers">Saving Buffers</a>.  For functions and
variables related to the display of buffers in windows, see
<a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>.
