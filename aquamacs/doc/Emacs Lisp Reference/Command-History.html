<h3 class="section">21.15 Command History</h3>

<p><a name="index-command-history-1418"></a><a name="index-complex-command-1419"></a><a name="index-history-of-commands-1420"></a>
  The command loop keeps a history of the complex commands that have
been executed, to make it convenient to repeat these commands.  A
<dfn>complex command</dfn> is one for which the interactive argument reading
uses the minibuffer.  This includes any <kbd>M-x</kbd> command, any
<kbd>M-:</kbd> command, and any command whose <code>interactive</code>
specification reads an argument from the minibuffer.  Explicit use of
the minibuffer during the execution of the command itself does not cause
the command to be considered complex.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>command-history</b><var><a name="index-command_002dhistory-1421"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable's value is a list of recent complex commands, each
represented as a form to evaluate.  It continues to accumulate all
complex commands for the duration of the editing session, but when it
reaches the maximum size (see <a href="Minibuffer-History.html#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>), the oldest
elements are deleted as new ones are added.

     <pre class="example">          command-history
          &rArr; ((switch-to-buffer "chistory.texi")
              (describe-key "^X^[")
              (visit-tags-table "~/emacs/src/")
              (find-tag "repeat-complex-command"))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>This history list is actually a special case of minibuffer history
(see <a href="Minibuffer-History.html#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>), with one special twist: the elements are
expressions rather than strings.

   <p>There are a number of commands devoted to the editing and recall of
previous commands.  The commands <code>repeat-complex-command</code>, and
<code>list-command-history</code> are described in the user manual
(see <a href="../emacs/Repetition.html#Repetition">Repetition</a>).  Within the
minibuffer, the usual minibuffer history commands are available.
