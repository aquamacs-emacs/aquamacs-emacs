<h4 class="subsection">34.6.3 Accessing the Entire Match Data</h4>

<p>The functions <code>match-data</code> and <code>set-match-data</code> read or
write the entire match data, all at once.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>match-data</b><var> &amp;optional integers reuse reseat<a name="index-match_002ddata-3030"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a list of positions (markers or integers) that
record all the information on what text the last search matched. 
Element zero is the position of the beginning of the match for the
whole expression; element one is the position of the end of the match
for the expression.  The next two elements are the positions of the
beginning and end of the match for the first subexpression, and so on. 
In general, element
number 2<var>n</var>
corresponds to <code>(match-beginning </code><var>n</var><code>)</code>; and
element
number 2<var>n</var> + 1
corresponds to <code>(match-end </code><var>n</var><code>)</code>.

        <p>Normally all the elements are markers or <code>nil</code>, but if
<var>integers</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, that means to use integers instead
of markers.  (In that case, the buffer itself is appended as an
additional element at the end of the list, to facilitate complete
restoration of the match data.)  If the last match was done on a
string with <code>string-match</code>, then integers are always used,
since markers can't point into a string.

        <p>If <var>reuse</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it should be a list.  In that case,
<code>match-data</code> stores the match data in <var>reuse</var>.  That is,
<var>reuse</var> is destructively modified.  <var>reuse</var> does not need to
have the right length.  If it is not long enough to contain the match
data, it is extended.  If it is too long, the length of <var>reuse</var>
stays the same, but the elements that were not used are set to
<code>nil</code>.  The purpose of this feature is to reduce the need for
garbage collection.

        <p>If <var>reseat</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, all markers on the <var>reuse</var> list
are reseated to point to nowhere.

        <p>As always, there must be no possibility of intervening searches between
the call to a search function and the call to <code>match-data</code> that is
intended to access the match data for that search.

     <pre class="example">          (match-data)
               &rArr;  (#&lt;marker at 9 in foo&gt;
                    #&lt;marker at 17 in foo&gt;
                    #&lt;marker at 13 in foo&gt;
                    #&lt;marker at 17 in foo&gt;)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-match-data</b><var> match-list &amp;optional reseat<a name="index-set_002dmatch_002ddata-3031"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets the match data from the elements of <var>match-list</var>,
which should be a list that was the value of a previous call to
<code>match-data</code>.  (More precisely, anything that has the same format
will work.)

        <p>If <var>match-list</var> refers to a buffer that doesn't exist, you don't get
an error; that sets the match data in a meaningless but harmless way.

        <p>If <var>reseat</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, all markers on the <var>match-list</var> list
are reseated to point to nowhere.

        <p><a name="index-store_002dmatch_002ddata-3032"></a><code>store-match-data</code> is a semi-obsolete alias for <code>set-match-data</code>.
