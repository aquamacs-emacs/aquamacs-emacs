<h3 class="section">17.3 Around-Advice</h3>

<p>Around-advice lets you &ldquo;wrap&rdquo; a Lisp expression &ldquo;around&rdquo; the
original function definition.  You specify where the original function
definition should go by means of the special symbol <code>ad-do-it</code>. 
Where this symbol occurs inside the around-advice body, it is replaced
with a <code>progn</code> containing the forms of the surrounded code.  Here
is an example:

<pre class="example">     (defadvice foo (around foo-around)
       "Ignore case in `foo'."
       (let ((case-fold-search t))
         ad-do-it))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Its effect is to make sure that case is ignored in
searches when the original definition of <code>foo</code> is run.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>ad-do-it</b><var><a name="index-ad_002ddo_002dit-886"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is not really a variable, rather a place-holder that looks like a
variable.  You use it in around-advice to specify the place to run the
function's original definition and other &ldquo;earlier&rdquo; around-advice. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If the around-advice does not use <code>ad-do-it</code>, then it does not run
the original function definition.  This provides a way to override the
original definition completely.  (It also overrides lower-positioned
pieces of around-advice).

   <p>If the around-advice uses <code>ad-do-it</code> more than once, the original
definition is run at each place.  In this way, around-advice can execute
the original definition (and lower-positioned pieces of around-advice)
several times.  Another way to do that is by using <code>ad-do-it</code>
inside of a loop.
