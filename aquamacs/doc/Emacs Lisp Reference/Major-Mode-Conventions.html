<h4 class="subsection">23.2.2 Major Mode Conventions</h4>

<p><a name="index-major-mode-conventions-1585"></a><a name="index-conventions-for-writing-major-modes-1586"></a>
  The code for existing major modes follows various coding conventions,
including conventions for local keymap and syntax table initialization,
global names, and hooks.  Please follow these conventions when you
define a new major mode.  (Fundamental mode is an exception to many
of these conventions, because its definition is to present the global
state of Emacs.)

   <p>This list of conventions is only partial, because each major mode
should aim for consistency in general with other Emacs major modes. 
This makes Emacs as a whole more coherent.  It is impossible to list
here all the possible points where this issue might come up; if the
Emacs developers point out an area where your major mode deviates from
the usual conventions, please make it compatible.

     <ul>
<li>Define a command whose name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-mode</span></samp>&rsquo;, with no arguments,
that switches to the new mode in the current buffer.  This command
should set up the keymap, syntax table, and buffer-local variables in an
existing buffer, without changing the buffer's contents.

     <li>Write a documentation string for this command that describes the
special commands available in this mode.  <kbd>C-h m</kbd>
(<code>describe-mode</code>) in your mode will display this string.

     <p>The documentation string may include the special documentation
substrings, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\[</span><var>command</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\{</span><var>keymap</var><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\&lt;</span><var>keymap</var><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, which enable the documentation to adapt
automatically to the user's own key bindings.  See <a href="Keys-in-Documentation.html#Keys-in-Documentation">Keys in Documentation</a>.

     <li>The major mode command should start by calling
<code>kill-all-local-variables</code>.  This runs the normal hook
<code>change-major-mode-hook</code>, then gets rid of the buffer-local
variables of the major mode previously in effect.  See <a href="Creating-Buffer_002dLocal.html#Creating-Buffer_002dLocal">Creating Buffer-Local</a>.

     <li>The major mode command should set the variable <code>major-mode</code> to the
major mode command symbol.  This is how <code>describe-mode</code> discovers
which documentation to print.

     <li>The major mode command should set the variable <code>mode-name</code> to the
&ldquo;pretty&rdquo; name of the mode, usually a string (but see <a href="Mode-Line-Data.html#Mode-Line-Data">Mode Line Data</a>, for other possible forms).  The name of the mode appears
in the mode line.

     <li><a name="index-functions-in-modes-1587"></a>Since all global names are in the same name space, all the global
variables, constants, and functions that are part of the mode should
have names that start with the major mode name (or with an abbreviation
of it if the name is long).  See <a href="Coding-Conventions.html#Coding-Conventions">Coding Conventions</a>.

     <li>In a major mode for editing some kind of structured text, such as a
programming language, indentation of text according to structure is
probably useful.  So the mode should set <code>indent-line-function</code>
to a suitable function, and probably customize other variables
for indentation.

     <li><a name="index-keymaps-in-modes-1588"></a>The major mode should usually have its own keymap, which is used as the
local keymap in all buffers in that mode.  The major mode command should
call <code>use-local-map</code> to install this local map.  See <a href="Active-Keymaps.html#Active-Keymaps">Active Keymaps</a>, for more information.

     <p>This keymap should be stored permanently in a global variable named
<var>modename</var><code>-mode-map</code>.  Normally the library that defines the
mode sets this variable.

     <p>See <a href="Tips-for-Defining.html#Tips-for-Defining">Tips for Defining</a>, for advice about how to write the code to set
up the mode's keymap variable.

     <li>The key sequences bound in a major mode keymap should usually start with
<kbd>C-c</kbd>, followed by a control character, a digit, or <kbd>{</kbd>,
<kbd>}</kbd>, <kbd>&lt;</kbd>, <kbd>&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>:</kbd> or <kbd>;</kbd>.  The other punctuation
characters are reserved for minor modes, and ordinary letters are
reserved for users.

     <p>A major mode can also rebind the keys <kbd>M-n</kbd>, <kbd>M-p</kbd> and
<kbd>M-s</kbd>.  The bindings for <kbd>M-n</kbd> and <kbd>M-p</kbd> should normally
be some kind of &ldquo;moving forward and backward,&rdquo; but this does not
necessarily mean cursor motion.

     <p>It is legitimate for a major mode to rebind a standard key sequence if
it provides a command that does &ldquo;the same job&rdquo; in a way better
suited to the text this mode is used for.  For example, a major mode
for editing a programming language might redefine <kbd>C-M-a</kbd> to
&ldquo;move to the beginning of a function&rdquo; in a way that works better for
that language.

     <p>It is also legitimate for a major mode to rebind a standard key
sequence whose standard meaning is rarely useful in that mode.  For
instance, minibuffer modes rebind <kbd>M-r</kbd>, whose standard meaning is
rarely of any use in the minibuffer.  Major modes such as Dired or
Rmail that do not allow self-insertion of text can reasonably redefine
letters and other printing characters as special commands.

     <li>Major modes for editing text should not define &lt;RET&gt; to do
anything other than insert a newline.  However, it is ok for
specialized modes for text that users don't directly edit, such as
Dired and Info modes, to redefine &lt;RET&gt; to do something entirely
different.

     <li>Major modes should not alter options that are primarily a matter of user
preference, such as whether Auto-Fill mode is enabled.  Leave this to
each user to decide.  However, a major mode should customize other
variables so that Auto-Fill mode will work usefully <em>if</em> the user
decides to use it.

     <li><a name="index-syntax-tables-in-modes-1589"></a>The mode may have its own syntax table or may share one with other
related modes.  If it has its own syntax table, it should store this in
a variable named <var>modename</var><code>-mode-syntax-table</code>.  See <a href="Syntax-Tables.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>.

     <li>If the mode handles a language that has a syntax for comments, it should
set the variables that define the comment syntax.  See <a href="../emacs/Options-for-Comments.html#Options-for-Comments">Options Controlling Comments</a>.

     <li><a name="index-abbrev-tables-in-modes-1590"></a>The mode may have its own abbrev table or may share one with other
related modes.  If it has its own abbrev table, it should store this
in a variable named <var>modename</var><code>-mode-abbrev-table</code>.  If the
major mode command defines any abbrevs itself, it should pass <code>t</code>
for the <var>system-flag</var> argument to <code>define-abbrev</code>. 
See <a href="Defining-Abbrevs.html#Defining-Abbrevs">Defining Abbrevs</a>.

     <li>The mode should specify how to do highlighting for Font Lock mode, by
setting up a buffer-local value for the variable
<code>font-lock-defaults</code> (see <a href="Font-Lock-Mode.html#Font-Lock-Mode">Font Lock Mode</a>).

     <li>The mode should specify how Imenu should find the definitions or
sections of a buffer, by setting up a buffer-local value for the
variable <code>imenu-generic-expression</code>, for the two variables
<code>imenu-prev-index-position-function</code> and
<code>imenu-extract-index-name-function</code>, or for the variable
<code>imenu-create-index-function</code> (see <a href="Imenu.html#Imenu">Imenu</a>).

     <li>The mode can specify a local value for
<code>eldoc-documentation-function</code> to tell ElDoc mode how to handle
this mode.

     <li>Use <code>defvar</code> or <code>defcustom</code> to set mode-related variables, so
that they are not reinitialized if they already have a value.  (Such
reinitialization could discard customizations made by the user.)

     <li><a name="index-buffer_002dlocal-variables-in-modes-1591"></a>To make a buffer-local binding for an Emacs customization variable, use
<code>make-local-variable</code> in the major mode command, not
<code>make-variable-buffer-local</code>.  The latter function would make the
variable local to every buffer in which it is subsequently set, which
would affect buffers that do not use this mode.  It is undesirable for a
mode to have such global effects.  See <a href="Buffer_002dLocal-Variables.html#Buffer_002dLocal-Variables">Buffer-Local Variables</a>.

     <p>With rare exceptions, the only reasonable way to use
<code>make-variable-buffer-local</code> in a Lisp package is for a variable
which is used only within that package.  Using it on a variable used by
other packages would interfere with them.

     <li><a name="index-mode-hook-1592"></a><a name="index-major-mode-hook-1593"></a>Each major mode should have a normal <dfn>mode hook</dfn> named
<var>modename</var><code>-mode-hook</code>.  The very last thing the major mode command
should do is to call <code>run-mode-hooks</code>.  This runs the mode hook,
and then runs the normal hook <code>after-change-major-mode-hook</code>. 
See <a href="Mode-Hooks.html#Mode-Hooks">Mode Hooks</a>.

     <li>The major mode command may start by calling some other major mode
command (called the <dfn>parent mode</dfn>) and then alter some of its
settings.  A mode that does this is called a <dfn>derived mode</dfn>.  The
recommended way to define one is to use the <code>define-derived-mode</code>
macro, but this is not required.  Such a mode should call the parent
mode command inside a <code>delay-mode-hooks</code> form.  (Using
<code>define-derived-mode</code> does this automatically.)  See <a href="Derived-Modes.html#Derived-Modes">Derived Modes</a>, and <a href="Mode-Hooks.html#Mode-Hooks">Mode Hooks</a>.

     <li>If something special should be done if the user switches a buffer from
this mode to any other major mode, this mode can set up a buffer-local
value for <code>change-major-mode-hook</code> (see <a href="Creating-Buffer_002dLocal.html#Creating-Buffer_002dLocal">Creating Buffer-Local</a>).

     <li>If this mode is appropriate only for specially-prepared text, then the
major mode command symbol should have a property named <code>mode-class</code>
with value <code>special</code>, put on as follows:

     <p><a name="index-mode_002dclass-_0040r_007b_0028property_0029_007d-1594"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bspecial_007d-1595"></a>
     <pre class="example">          (put 'funny-mode 'mode-class 'special)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This tells Emacs that new buffers created while the current buffer is
in Funny mode should not inherit Funny mode, in case the default value
of <code>major-mode</code> is <code>nil</code>.  Modes such as Dired, Rmail,
and Buffer List use this feature.

     <p>The <code>define-derived-mode</code> macro automatically marks the derived
mode as special if the parent mode is special.  The special mode
<code>special-mode</code> provides a convenient parent for other special
modes to inherit from; it sets <code>buffer-read-only</code> to <code>t</code>,
and does nothing else.

     <li>If you want to make the new mode the default for files with certain
recognizable names, add an element to <code>auto-mode-alist</code> to select
the mode for those file names (see <a href="Auto-Major-Mode.html#Auto-Major-Mode">Auto Major Mode</a>).  If you
define the mode command to autoload, you should add this element in
the same file that calls <code>autoload</code>.  If you use an autoload
cookie for the mode command, you can also use an autoload cookie for
the form that adds the element (see <a href="autoload-cookie.html#autoload-cookie">autoload cookie</a>).  If you do
not autoload the mode command, it is sufficient to add the element in
the file that contains the mode definition.

     <li>In the comments that document the file, you should provide a sample
<code>autoload</code> form and an example of how to add to
<code>auto-mode-alist</code>, that users can include in their init files
(see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).

     <li><a name="index-mode-loading-1596"></a>The top-level forms in the file defining the mode should be written so
that they may be evaluated more than once without adverse consequences. 
Even if you never load the file more than once, someone else will. 
</ul>
