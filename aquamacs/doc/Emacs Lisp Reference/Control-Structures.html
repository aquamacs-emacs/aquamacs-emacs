<h2 class="chapter">10 Control Structures</h2>

<p><a name="index-special-forms-for-control-structures-522"></a><a name="index-control-structures-523"></a>
  A Lisp program consists of expressions or <dfn>forms</dfn> (see <a href="Forms.html#Forms">Forms</a>). 
We control the order of execution of these forms by enclosing them in
<dfn>control structures</dfn>.  Control structures are special forms which
control when, whether, or how many times to execute the forms they
contain.

   <p><a name="index-textual-order-524"></a>  The simplest order of execution is sequential execution: first form
<var>a</var>, then form <var>b</var>, and so on.  This is what happens when you
write several forms in succession in the body of a function, or at top
level in a file of Lisp code&mdash;the forms are executed in the order
written.  We call this <dfn>textual order</dfn>.  For example, if a function
body consists of two forms <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>, evaluation of the
function evaluates first <var>a</var> and then <var>b</var>.  The result of
evaluating <var>b</var> becomes the value of the function.

   <p>Explicit control structures make possible an order of execution other
than sequential.

   <p>Emacs Lisp provides several kinds of control structure, including
other varieties of sequencing, conditionals, iteration, and (controlled)
jumps&mdash;all discussed below.  The built-in control structures are
special forms since their subforms are not necessarily evaluated or not
evaluated sequentially.  You can use macros to define your own control
structure constructs (see <a href="Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>).
