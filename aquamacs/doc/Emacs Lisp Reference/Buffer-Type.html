<h4 class="subsection">2.4.1 Buffer Type</h4>

<p>A <dfn>buffer</dfn> is an object that holds text that can be edited
(see <a href="Buffers.html#Buffers">Buffers</a>).  Most buffers hold the contents of a disk file
(see <a href="Files.html#Files">Files</a>) so they can be edited, but some are used for other
purposes.  Most buffers are also meant to be seen by the user, and
therefore displayed, at some time, in a window (see <a href="Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>).  But
a buffer need not be displayed in any window.  Each buffer has a
designated position called <dfn>point</dfn> (see <a href="Positions.html#Positions">Positions</a>); most
editing commands act on the contents of the current buffer in the
neighborhood of point.  At any time, one buffer is the <dfn>current
buffer</dfn>.

   <p>The contents of a buffer are much like a string, but buffers are not
used like strings in Emacs Lisp, and the available operations are
different.  For example, you can insert text efficiently into an
existing buffer, altering the buffer's contents, whereas &ldquo;inserting&rdquo;
text into a string requires concatenating substrings, and the result
is an entirely new string object.

   <p>Many of the standard Emacs functions manipulate or test the
characters in the current buffer; a whole chapter in this manual is
devoted to describing these functions (see <a href="Text.html#Text">Text</a>).

   <p>Several other data structures are associated with each buffer:

     <ul>
<li>a local syntax table (see <a href="Syntax-Tables.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>);

     <li>a local keymap (see <a href="Keymaps.html#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>); and,

     <li>a list of buffer-local variable bindings (see <a href="Buffer_002dLocal-Variables.html#Buffer_002dLocal-Variables">Buffer-Local Variables</a>).

     <li>overlays (see <a href="Overlays.html#Overlays">Overlays</a>).

     <li>text properties for the text in the buffer (see <a href="Text-Properties.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>). 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The local keymap and variable list contain entries that individually
override global bindings or values.  These are used to customize the
behavior of programs in different buffers, without actually changing the
programs.

   <p>A buffer may be <dfn>indirect</dfn>, which means it shares the text
of another buffer, but presents it differently.  See <a href="Indirect-Buffers.html#Indirect-Buffers">Indirect Buffers</a>.

   <p>Buffers have no read syntax.  They print in hash notation, showing the
buffer name.
