<h4 class="subsection">35.6.1 Motion Commands Based on Parsing</h4>

<p>This section describes simple point-motion functions that operate
based on parsing expressions.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>scan-lists</b><var> from count depth<a name="index-scan_002dlists-3086"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function scans forward <var>count</var> balanced parenthetical groupings
from position <var>from</var>.  It returns the position where the scan stops. 
If <var>count</var> is negative, the scan moves backwards.

        <p>If <var>depth</var> is nonzero, parenthesis depth counting begins from that
value.  The only candidates for stopping are places where the depth in
parentheses becomes zero; <code>scan-lists</code> counts <var>count</var> such
places and then stops.  Thus, a positive value for <var>depth</var> means go
out <var>depth</var> levels of parenthesis.

        <p>Scanning ignores comments if <code>parse-sexp-ignore-comments</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>.

        <p>If the scan reaches the beginning or end of the buffer (or its
accessible portion), and the depth is not zero, an error is signaled. 
If the depth is zero but the count is not used up, <code>nil</code> is
returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>scan-sexps</b><var> from count<a name="index-scan_002dsexps-3087"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function scans forward <var>count</var> sexps from position <var>from</var>. 
It returns the position where the scan stops.  If <var>count</var> is
negative, the scan moves backwards.

        <p>Scanning ignores comments if <code>parse-sexp-ignore-comments</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>.

        <p>If the scan reaches the beginning or end of (the accessible part of) the
buffer while in the middle of a parenthetical grouping, an error is
signaled.  If it reaches the beginning or end between groupings but
before count is used up, <code>nil</code> is returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>forward-comment</b><var> count<a name="index-forward_002dcomment-3088"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function moves point forward across <var>count</var> complete comments
     (that is, including the starting delimiter and the terminating
delimiter if any), plus any whitespace encountered on the way.  It
moves backward if <var>count</var> is negative.  If it encounters anything
other than a comment or whitespace, it stops, leaving point at the
place where it stopped.  This includes (for instance) finding the end
of a comment when moving forward and expecting the beginning of one. 
The function also stops immediately after moving over the specified
number of complete comments.  If <var>count</var> comments are found as
expected, with nothing except whitespace between them, it returns
<code>t</code>; otherwise it returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>This function cannot tell whether the &ldquo;comments&rdquo; it traverses are
embedded within a string.  If they look like comments, it treats them
as comments. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>To move forward over all comments and whitespace following point, use
<code>(forward-comment (buffer-size))</code>.  <code>(buffer-size)</code> is a good
argument to use, because the number of comments in the buffer cannot
exceed that many.
