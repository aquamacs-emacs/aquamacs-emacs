<h4 class="subsection">30.2.5 Motion by Screen Lines</h4>

<p>The line functions in the previous section count text lines, delimited
only by newline characters.  By contrast, these functions count screen
lines, which are defined by the way the text appears on the screen.  A
text line is a single screen line if it is short enough to fit the width
of the selected window, but otherwise it may occupy several screen
lines.

   <p>In some cases, text lines are truncated on the screen rather than
continued onto additional screen lines.  In these cases,
<code>vertical-motion</code> moves point much like <code>forward-line</code>. 
See <a href="Truncation.html#Truncation">Truncation</a>.

   <p>Because the width of a given string depends on the flags that control
the appearance of certain characters, <code>vertical-motion</code> behaves
differently, for a given piece of text, depending on the buffer it is
in, and even on the selected window (because the width, the truncation
flag, and display table may vary between windows).  See <a href="Usual-Display.html#Usual-Display">Usual Display</a>.

   <p>These functions scan text to determine where screen lines break, and
thus take time proportional to the distance scanned.  If you intend to
use them heavily, Emacs provides caches which may improve the
performance of your code.  See <a href="Truncation.html#Truncation">cache-long-line-scans</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>vertical-motion</b><var> count &amp;optional window<a name="index-vertical_002dmotion-2420"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function moves point to the start of the screen line <var>count</var>
screen lines down from the screen line containing point.  If <var>count</var>
is negative, it moves up instead.

        <p>The <var>count</var> argument can be a cons cell, <code>(</code><var>cols</var><code>
. </code><var>lines</var><code>)</code>, instead of an integer.  Then the function moves by
<var>lines</var> screen lines, and puts point <var>cols</var> columns from the
start of that screen line.

        <p>The return value is the number of screen lines over which point was
moved.  The value may be less in absolute value than <var>count</var> if
the beginning or end of the buffer was reached.

        <p>The window <var>window</var> is used for obtaining parameters such as the
width, the horizontal scrolling, and the display table.  But
<code>vertical-motion</code> always operates on the current buffer, even if
<var>window</var> currently displays some other buffer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>count-screen-lines</b><var> &amp;optional beg end count-final-newline window<a name="index-count_002dscreen_002dlines-2421"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the number of screen lines in the text from
<var>beg</var> to <var>end</var>.  The number of screen lines may be different
from the number of actual lines, due to line continuation, the display
table, etc.  If <var>beg</var> and <var>end</var> are <code>nil</code> or omitted,
they default to the beginning and end of the accessible portion of the
buffer.

        <p>If the region ends with a newline, that is ignored unless the optional
third argument <var>count-final-newline</var> is non-<code>nil</code>.

        <p>The optional fourth argument <var>window</var> specifies the window for
obtaining parameters such as width, horizontal scrolling, and so on. 
The default is to use the selected window's parameters.

        <p>Like <code>vertical-motion</code>, <code>count-screen-lines</code> always uses the
current buffer, regardless of which buffer is displayed in
<var>window</var>.  This makes possible to use <code>count-screen-lines</code> in
any buffer, whether or not it is currently displayed in some window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>move-to-window-line</b><var> count<a name="index-move_002dto_002dwindow_002dline-2422"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function moves point with respect to the text currently displayed
in the selected window.  It moves point to the beginning of the screen
line <var>count</var> screen lines from the top of the window.  If
<var>count</var> is negative, that specifies a position
&minus;<var>count</var><!-- /@w --> lines from the bottom (or the last line of the
buffer, if the buffer ends above the specified screen position).

        <p>If <var>count</var> is <code>nil</code>, then point moves to the beginning of the
line in the middle of the window.  If the absolute value of <var>count</var>
is greater than the size of the window, then point moves to the place
that would appear on that screen line if the window were tall enough. 
This will probably cause the next redisplay to scroll to bring that
location onto the screen.

        <p>In an interactive call, <var>count</var> is the numeric prefix argument.

        <p>The value returned is the window line number point has moved to, with
the top line in the window numbered 0.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>compute-motion</b><var> from frompos to topos width offsets window<a name="index-compute_002dmotion-2423"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function scans the current buffer, calculating screen positions. 
It scans the buffer forward from position <var>from</var>, assuming that is
at screen coordinates <var>frompos</var>, to position <var>to</var> or coordinates
<var>topos</var>, whichever comes first.  It returns the ending buffer
position and screen coordinates.

        <p>The coordinate arguments <var>frompos</var> and <var>topos</var> are cons cells of
the form <code>(</code><var>hpos</var><code> . </code><var>vpos</var><code>)</code>.

        <p>The argument <var>width</var> is the number of columns available to display
text; this affects handling of continuation lines.  <code>nil</code> means
the actual number of usable text columns in the window, which is
equivalent to the value returned by <code>(window-width window)</code>.

        <p>The argument <var>offsets</var> is either <code>nil</code> or a cons cell of the
form <code>(</code><var>hscroll</var><code> . </code><var>tab-offset</var><code>)</code>.  Here <var>hscroll</var> is
the number of columns not being displayed at the left margin; most
callers get this by calling <code>window-hscroll</code>.  Meanwhile,
<var>tab-offset</var> is the offset between column numbers on the screen and
column numbers in the buffer.  This can be nonzero in a continuation
line, when the previous screen lines' widths do not add up to a multiple
of <code>tab-width</code>.  It is always zero in a non-continuation line.

        <p>The window <var>window</var> serves only to specify which display table to
use.  <code>compute-motion</code> always operates on the current buffer,
regardless of what buffer is displayed in <var>window</var>.

        <p>The return value is a list of five elements:

     <pre class="example">          (<var>pos</var> <var>hpos</var> <var>vpos</var> <var>prevhpos</var> <var>contin</var>)
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">Here <var>pos</var> is the buffer position where the scan stopped, <var>vpos</var>
is the vertical screen position, and <var>hpos</var> is the horizontal screen
position.

        <p>The result <var>prevhpos</var> is the horizontal position one character back
from <var>pos</var>.  The result <var>contin</var> is <code>t</code> if the last line
was continued after (or within) the previous character.

        <p>For example, to find the buffer position of column <var>col</var> of screen line
<var>line</var> of a certain window, pass the window's display start location
as <var>from</var> and the window's upper-left coordinates as <var>frompos</var>. 
Pass the buffer's <code>(point-max)</code> as <var>to</var>, to limit the scan to
the end of the accessible portion of the buffer, and pass <var>line</var> and
<var>col</var> as <var>topos</var>.  Here's a function that does this:

     <pre class="example">          (defun coordinates-of-position (col line)
            (car (compute-motion (window-start)
                                 '(0 . 0)
                                 (point-max)
                                 (cons col line)
                                 (window-width)
                                 (cons (window-hscroll) 0)
                                 (selected-window))))
</pre>
        <p>When you use <code>compute-motion</code> for the minibuffer, you need to use
<code>minibuffer-prompt-width</code> to get the horizontal position of the
beginning of the first screen line.  See <a href="Minibuffer-Contents.html#Minibuffer-Contents">Minibuffer Contents</a>.
