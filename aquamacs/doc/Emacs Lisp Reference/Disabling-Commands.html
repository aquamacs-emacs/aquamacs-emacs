<h3 class="section">21.14 Disabling Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-disabled-command-1413"></a>
  <dfn>Disabling a command</dfn> marks the command as requiring user
confirmation before it can be executed.  Disabling is used for commands
which might be confusing to beginning users, to prevent them from using
the commands by accident.

   <p><a name="index-disabled-1414"></a>  The low-level mechanism for disabling a command is to put a
non-<code>nil</code> <code>disabled</code> property on the Lisp symbol for the
command.  These properties are normally set up by the user's
init file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>) with Lisp expressions such as this:

<pre class="example">     (put 'upcase-region 'disabled t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For a few commands, these properties are present by default (you can
remove them in your init file if you wish).

   <p>If the value of the <code>disabled</code> property is a string, the message
saying the command is disabled includes that string.  For example:

<pre class="example">     (put 'delete-region 'disabled
          "Text deleted this way cannot be yanked back!\n")
</pre>
   <p>See <a href="../emacs/Disabling.html#Disabling">Disabling</a>, for the details on
what happens when a disabled command is invoked interactively. 
Disabling a command has no effect on calling it as a function from Lisp
programs.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>enable-command</b><var> command<a name="index-enable_002dcommand-1415"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Allow <var>command</var> (a symbol) to be executed without special
confirmation from now on, and alter the user's init file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>) so that this will apply to future sessions. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>disable-command</b><var> command<a name="index-disable_002dcommand-1416"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Require special confirmation to execute <var>command</var> from now on, and
alter the user's init file so that this will apply to future sessions. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>disabled-command-function</b><var><a name="index-disabled_002dcommand_002dfunction-1417"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable should be a function.  When the user
invokes a disabled command interactively, this function is called
instead of the disabled command.  It can use <code>this-command-keys</code>
to determine what the user typed to run the command, and thus find the
command itself.

        <p>The value may also be <code>nil</code>.  Then all commands work normally,
even disabled ones.

        <p>By default, the value is a function that asks the user whether to
proceed.
