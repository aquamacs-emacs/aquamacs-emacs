<h4 class="subsection">14.4.5 Defining New Types</h4>

<p>In the previous sections we have described how to construct elaborate
type specifications for <code>defcustom</code>.  In some cases you may want
to give such a type specification a name.  The obvious case is when
you are using the same type for many user options: rather than repeat
the specification for each option, you can give the type specification
a name, and use that name each <code>defcustom</code>.  The other case is
when a user option's value is a recursive data structure.  To make it
possible for a datatype to refer to itself, it needs to have a name.

   <p>Since custom types are implemented as widgets, the way to define a new
customize type is to define a new widget.  We are not going to describe
the widget interface here in details, see <a href="../widget/index.html#Top">Introduction</a>, for that.  Instead we are going to
demonstrate the minimal functionality needed for defining new customize
types by a simple example.

<pre class="example">     (define-widget 'binary-tree-of-string 'lazy
       "A binary tree made of cons-cells and strings."
       :offset 4
       :tag "Node"
       :type '(choice (string :tag "Leaf" :value "")
                      (cons :tag "Interior"
                            :value ("" . "")
                            binary-tree-of-string
                            binary-tree-of-string)))
     
     (defcustom foo-bar ""
       "Sample variable holding a binary tree of strings."
       :type 'binary-tree-of-string)
</pre>
   <p>The function to define a new widget is called <code>define-widget</code>.  The
first argument is the symbol we want to make a new widget type.  The
second argument is a symbol representing an existing widget, the new
widget is going to be defined in terms of difference from the existing
widget.  For the purpose of defining new customization types, the
<code>lazy</code> widget is perfect, because it accepts a <code>:type</code> keyword
argument with the same syntax as the keyword argument to
<code>defcustom</code> with the same name.  The third argument is a
documentation string for the new widget.  You will be able to see that
string with the <kbd>M-x widget-browse &lt;RET&gt; binary-tree-of-string
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> command.

   <p>After these mandatory arguments follow the keyword arguments.  The most
important is <code>:type</code>, which describes the data type we want to match
with this widget.  Here a <code>binary-tree-of-string</code> is described as
being either a string, or a cons-cell whose car and cdr are themselves
both <code>binary-tree-of-string</code>.  Note the reference to the widget
type we are currently in the process of defining.  The <code>:tag</code>
attribute is a string to name the widget in the user interface, and the
<code>:offset</code> argument is there to ensure that child nodes are
indented four spaces relative to the parent node, making the tree
structure apparent in the customization buffer.

   <p>The <code>defcustom</code> shows how the new widget can be used as an ordinary
customization type.

   <p>The reason for the name <code>lazy</code> is that the other composite
widgets convert their inferior widgets to internal form when the
widget is instantiated in a buffer.  This conversion is recursive, so
the inferior widgets will convert <em>their</em> inferior widgets.  If
the data structure is itself recursive, this conversion is an infinite
recursion.  The <code>lazy</code> widget prevents the recursion: it convert
its <code>:type</code> argument only when needed.
