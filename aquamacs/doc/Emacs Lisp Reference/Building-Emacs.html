<h3 class="appendixsec">E.1 Building Emacs</h3>

<p><a name="index-building-Emacs-3845"></a><a name="index-temacs-3846"></a>
  This section explains the steps involved in building the Emacs
executable.  You don't have to know this material to build and install
Emacs, since the makefiles do all these things automatically.  This
information is pertinent to Emacs maintenance.

   <p>Compilation of the C source files in the <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp> directory
produces an executable file called <samp><span class="file">temacs</span></samp>, also called a
<dfn>bare impure Emacs</dfn>.  It contains the Emacs Lisp interpreter and I/O
routines, but not the editing commands.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bloadup_002eel_007d-3847"></a>  The command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">temacs&nbsp;-l&nbsp;loadup</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> uses <samp><span class="file">temacs</span></samp> to create
the real runnable Emacs executable.  These arguments direct
<samp><span class="file">temacs</span></samp> to evaluate the Lisp files specified in the file
<samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp>.  These files set up the normal Emacs editing
environment, resulting in an Emacs that is still impure but no longer
bare.

   <p><a name="index-dumping-Emacs-3848"></a>  It takes a substantial time to load the standard Lisp files.  Luckily,
you don't have to do this each time you run Emacs; <samp><span class="file">temacs</span></samp> can
dump out an executable program called <samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp> that has these files
preloaded.  <samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp> starts more quickly because it does not need to
load the files.  This is the Emacs executable that is normally
installed.

   <p><a name="index-preloaded_002dfile_002dlist-3849"></a><a name="index-dumped-Lisp-files-3850"></a>  To create <samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp>, use the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">temacs -batch -l loadup
dump</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The purpose of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-batch</span></samp>&rsquo; here is to prevent <samp><span class="file">temacs</span></samp>
from trying to initialize any of its data on the terminal; this ensures
that the tables of terminal information are empty in the dumped Emacs. 
The argument &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dump</span></samp>&rsquo; tells <samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp> to dump a new executable
named <samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp>.  The variable <code>preloaded-file-list</code> stores a
list of the Lisp files that were dumped with the <samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp> executable.

   <p>Some operating systems don't support dumping.  On those systems, you
must start Emacs with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">temacs -l loadup</span></samp>&rsquo; command each time you
use it.  This takes a substantial time, but since you need to start
Emacs once a day at most&mdash;or once a week if you never log out&mdash;the
extra time is not too severe a problem.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bsite_002dload_002eel_007d-3851"></a>
  You can specify additional files to preload by writing a library named
<samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> that loads them.  You may need to add a definition

<pre class="example">     #define SITELOAD_PURESIZE_EXTRA <var>n</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to make <var>n</var> added bytes of pure space to hold the additional files. 
(Try adding increments of 20000 until it is big enough.)  However, the
advantage of preloading additional files decreases as machines get
faster.  On modern machines, it is usually not advisable.

   <p>After <samp><span class="file">loadup.el</span></samp> reads <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp>, it finds the
documentation strings for primitive and preloaded functions (and
variables) in the file <samp><span class="file">etc/DOC</span></samp> where they are stored, by
calling <code>Snarf-documentation</code> (see <a href="Definition-of-Snarf_002ddocumentation.html#Definition-of-Snarf_002ddocumentation">Accessing Documentation</a>).

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bsite_002dinit_002eel_007d-3852"></a><a name="index-preloading-additional-functions-and-variables-3853"></a>  You can specify other Lisp expressions to execute just before dumping
by putting them in a library named <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp>.  This file is
executed after the documentation strings are found.

   <p>If you want to preload function or variable definitions, there are
three ways you can do this and make their documentation strings
accessible when you subsequently run Emacs:

     <ul>
<li>Arrange to scan these files when producing the <samp><span class="file">etc/DOC</span></samp> file,
and load them with <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp>.

     <li>Load the files with <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp>, then copy the files into the
installation directory for Lisp files when you install Emacs.

     <li>Specify a non-<code>nil</code> value for
<code>byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</code> as a local variable in each of these
files, and load them with either <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp>.  (This method has the drawback that the
documentation strings take up space in Emacs all the time.) 
</ul>

   <p>It is not advisable to put anything in <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp> that would alter any of the features that users
expect in an ordinary unmodified Emacs.  If you feel you must override
normal features for your site, do it with <samp><span class="file">default.el</span></samp>, so that
users can override your changes if they wish.  See <a href="Startup-Summary.html#Startup-Summary">Startup Summary</a>.

   <p>In a package that can be preloaded, it is sometimes useful to
specify a computation to be done when Emacs subsequently starts up. 
For this, use <code>eval-at-startup</code>:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>eval-at-startup</b><var> body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-eval_002dat_002dstartup-3854"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This evaluates the <var>body</var> forms, either immediately if running in
an Emacs that has already started up, or later when Emacs does start
up.  Since the value of the <var>body</var> forms is not necessarily
available when the <code>eval-at-startup</code> form is run, that form
always returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>dump-emacs</b><var> to-file from-file<a name="index-dump_002demacs-3855"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-unexec-3856"></a>This function dumps the current state of Emacs into an executable file
<var>to-file</var>.  It takes symbols from <var>from-file</var> (this is normally
the executable file <samp><span class="file">temacs</span></samp>).

        <p>If you want to use this function in an Emacs that was already dumped,
you must run Emacs with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-batch</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
</p></blockquote></div>
