<h3 class="section">24.5 Help Functions</h3>

<p>Emacs provides a variety of on-line help functions, all accessible to
the user as subcommands of the prefix <kbd>C-h</kbd>.  For more information
about them, see <a href="../emacs/Help.html#Help">Help</a>.  Here
we describe some program-level interfaces to the same information.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>apropos</b><var> pattern &amp;optional do-all<a name="index-apropos-1731"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function finds all &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; symbols whose names contain a
match for the apropos pattern <var>pattern</var>.  An apropos pattern is
either a word to match, a space-separated list of words of which at
least two must match, or a regular expression (if any special regular
expression characters occur).  A symbol is &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; if it has a
definition as a function, variable, or face, or has properties.

        <p>The function returns a list of elements that look like this:

     <pre class="example">          (<var>symbol</var> <var>score</var> <var>fn-doc</var> <var>var-doc</var>
           <var>plist-doc</var> <var>widget-doc</var> <var>face-doc</var> <var>group-doc</var>)
</pre>
        <p>Here, <var>score</var> is an integer measure of how important the symbol
seems to be as a match, and the remaining elements are documentation
strings for <var>symbol</var>'s various roles (or <code>nil</code>).

        <p>It also displays the symbols in a buffer named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Apropos*</span></samp>&rsquo;, each
with a one-line description taken from the beginning of its
documentation string.

        <p>If <var>do-all</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, or if the user option
<code>apropos-do-all</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <code>apropos</code> also
shows key bindings for the functions that are found; it also shows
<em>all</em> interned symbols, not just meaningful ones (and it lists
them in the return value as well). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>help-map</b><var><a name="index-help_002dmap-1732"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a local keymap for characters following the
Help key, <kbd>C-h</kbd>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Prefix Command: <b>help-command</b><var><a name="index-help_002dcommand-1733"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This symbol is not a function; its function definition cell holds the
keymap known as <code>help-map</code>.  It is defined in <samp><span class="file">help.el</span></samp> as
follows:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (define-key global-map (char-to-string help-char) 'help-command)
          (fset 'help-command help-map)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>help-char</b><var><a name="index-help_002dchar-1734"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is the help character&mdash;the character that
Emacs recognizes as meaning Help.  By default, its value is 8, which
stands for <kbd>C-h</kbd>.  When Emacs reads this character, if
<code>help-form</code> is a non-<code>nil</code> Lisp expression, it evaluates that
expression, and displays the result in a window if it is a string.

        <p>Usually the value of <code>help-form</code> is <code>nil</code>.  Then the
help character has no special meaning at the level of command input, and
it becomes part of a key sequence in the normal way.  The standard key
binding of <kbd>C-h</kbd> is a prefix key for several general-purpose help
features.

        <p>The help character is special after prefix keys, too.  If it has no
binding as a subcommand of the prefix key, it runs
<code>describe-prefix-bindings</code>, which displays a list of all the
subcommands of the prefix key. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>help-event-list</b><var><a name="index-help_002devent_002dlist-1735"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a list of event types that serve as
alternative &ldquo;help characters.&rdquo;  These events are handled just like the
event specified by <code>help-char</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>help-form</b><var><a name="index-help_002dform-1736"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, its value is a form to evaluate
whenever the character <code>help-char</code> is read.  If evaluating the form
produces a string, that string is displayed.

        <p>A command that calls <code>read-event</code> or <code>read-char</code> probably
should bind <code>help-form</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> expression while it
does input.  (The time when you should not do this is when <kbd>C-h</kbd> has
some other meaning.)  Evaluating this expression should result in a
string that explains what the input is for and how to enter it properly.

        <p>Entry to the minibuffer binds this variable to the value of
<code>minibuffer-help-form</code> (see <a href="Definition-of-minibuffer_002dhelp_002dform.html#Definition-of-minibuffer_002dhelp_002dform">Definition of minibuffer-help-form</a>). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>prefix-help-command</b><var><a name="index-prefix_002dhelp_002dcommand-1737"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds a function to print help for a prefix key.  The
function is called when the user types a prefix key followed by the help
character, and the help character has no binding after that prefix.  The
variable's default value is <code>describe-prefix-bindings</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>describe-prefix-bindings</b><var><a name="index-describe_002dprefix_002dbindings-1738"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function calls <code>describe-bindings</code> to display a list of all
the subcommands of the prefix key of the most recent key sequence.  The
prefix described consists of all but the last event of that key
sequence.  (The last event is, presumably, the help character.) 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The following two functions are meant for modes that want to provide
help without relinquishing control, such as the &ldquo;electric&rdquo; modes. 
Their names begin with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Helper</span></samp>&rsquo; to distinguish them from the
ordinary help functions.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>Helper-describe-bindings</b><var><a name="index-Helper_002ddescribe_002dbindings-1739"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command pops up a window displaying a help buffer containing a
listing of all of the key bindings from both the local and global keymaps. 
It works by calling <code>describe-bindings</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>Helper-help</b><var><a name="index-Helper_002dhelp-1740"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command provides help for the current mode.  It prompts the user
in the minibuffer with the message &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Help (Type ? for further
options)</span></samp>&rsquo;, and then provides assistance in finding out what the key
bindings are, and what the mode is intended for.  It returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>This can be customized by changing the map <code>Helper-help-map</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>data-directory</b><var><a name="index-data_002ddirectory-1741"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-data_002ddirectory"></a>This variable holds the name of the directory in which Emacs finds
certain documentation and text files that come with Emacs. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>help-buffer</b><var><a name="index-help_002dbuffer-1742"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the name of the help buffer, which is normally
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Help*</span></samp>&rsquo;; if such a buffer does not exist, it is first created. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>with-help-window</b><var> buffer-name body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002dhelp_002dwindow-1743"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro evaluates the <var>body</var> forms, inserting any output they
produce into a buffer named <var>buffer-name</var> like
<code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code> (see <a href="Temporary-Displays.html#Temporary-Displays">Temporary Displays</a>). 
(Usually, <var>buffer-name</var> should be the value returned by the
function <code>help-buffer</code>.)  It also puts the specified buffer into
Help mode and displays a message telling the user how to quit and
scroll the help window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>help-setup-xref</b><var> item interactive-p<a name="index-help_002dsetup_002dxref-1744"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function updates the cross reference data in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Help*</span></samp>&rsquo;
buffer, which is used to regenerate the help information when the user
clicks on the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Back</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo; buttons.  Most commands
that use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Help*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer should invoke this function before
clearing the buffer.  The <var>item</var> argument should have the form
<code>(</code><var>funtion</var><code> . </code><var>args</var><code>)</code>, where <var>funtion</var> is a function
to call, with argument list <var>args</var>, to regenerate the help buffer. 
The <var>interactive-p</var> argument is non-<code>nil</code> if the calling
command was invoked interactively; in that case, the stack of items
for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Help*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer's &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Back</span></samp>&rsquo; buttons is cleared. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>See <a href="describe_002dsymbols-example.html#describe_002dsymbols-example">describe-symbols example</a>, for an example of using
<code>help-buffer</code>, <code>with-help-window</code>, and
<code>help-setup-xref</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>make-help-screen</b><var> fname help-line help-text help-map<a name="index-make_002dhelp_002dscreen-1745"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro defines a help command named <var>fname</var> that acts like a
prefix key that shows a list of the subcommands it offers.

        <p>When invoked, <var>fname</var> displays <var>help-text</var> in a window, then
reads and executes a key sequence according to <var>help-map</var>.  The
string <var>help-text</var> should describe the bindings available in
<var>help-map</var>.

        <p>The command <var>fname</var> is defined to handle a few events itself, by
scrolling the display of <var>help-text</var>.  When <var>fname</var> reads one of
those special events, it does the scrolling and then reads another
event.  When it reads an event that is not one of those few, and which
has a binding in <var>help-map</var>, it executes that key's binding and
then returns.

        <p>The argument <var>help-line</var> should be a single-line summary of the
alternatives in <var>help-map</var>.  In the current version of Emacs, this
argument is used only if you set the option <code>three-step-help</code> to
<code>t</code>.

        <p>This macro is used in the command <code>help-for-help</code> which is the
binding of <kbd>C-h C-h</kbd>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>three-step-help</b><var><a name="index-three_002dstep_002dhelp-1746"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, commands defined with
<code>make-help-screen</code> display their <var>help-line</var> strings in the
echo area at first, and display the longer <var>help-text</var> strings only
if the user types the help character again. 
</p></blockquote></div>
