<h3 class="section">37.8 Sending Signals to Processes</h3>

<p><a name="index-process-signals-3233"></a><a name="index-sending-signals-3234"></a><a name="index-signals-3235"></a>
  <dfn>Sending a signal</dfn> to a subprocess is a way of interrupting its
activities.  There are several different signals, each with its own
meaning.  The set of signals and their names is defined by the operating
system.  For example, the signal <code>SIGINT</code> means that the user has
typed <kbd>C-c</kbd>, or that some analogous thing has happened.

   <p>Each signal has a standard effect on the subprocess.  Most signals
kill the subprocess, but some stop or resume execution instead.  Most
signals can optionally be handled by programs; if the program handles
the signal, then we can say nothing in general about its effects.

   <p>You can send signals explicitly by calling the functions in this
section.  Emacs also sends signals automatically at certain times:
killing a buffer sends a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to all its associated
processes; killing Emacs sends a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to all remaining
processes.  (<code>SIGHUP</code> is a signal that usually indicates that the
user hung up the phone.)

   <p>Each of the signal-sending functions takes two optional arguments:
<var>process</var> and <var>current-group</var>.

   <p>The argument <var>process</var> must be either a process, a process
name, a buffer, a buffer name, or <code>nil</code>.  A buffer or buffer name
stands for a process through <code>get-buffer-process</code>.  <code>nil</code>
stands for the process associated with the current buffer.  An error
is signaled if <var>process</var> does not identify a process.

   <p>The argument <var>current-group</var> is a flag that makes a difference
when you are running a job-control shell as an Emacs subprocess.  If it
is non-<code>nil</code>, then the signal is sent to the current process-group
of the terminal that Emacs uses to communicate with the subprocess.  If
the process is a job-control shell, this means the shell's current
subjob.  If it is <code>nil</code>, the signal is sent to the process group of
the immediate subprocess of Emacs.  If the subprocess is a job-control
shell, this is the shell itself.

   <p>The flag <var>current-group</var> has no effect when a pipe is used to
communicate with the subprocess, because the operating system does not
support the distinction in the case of pipes.  For the same reason,
job-control shells won't work when a pipe is used.  See
<code>process-connection-type</code> in <a href="Asynchronous-Processes.html#Asynchronous-Processes">Asynchronous Processes</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>interrupt-process</b><var> &amp;optional process current-group<a name="index-interrupt_002dprocess-3236"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function interrupts the process <var>process</var> by sending the
signal <code>SIGINT</code>.  Outside of Emacs, typing the &ldquo;interrupt
character&rdquo; (normally <kbd>C-c</kbd> on some systems, and <code>DEL</code> on
others) sends this signal.  When the argument <var>current-group</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, you can think of this function as &ldquo;typing <kbd>C-c</kbd>&rdquo;
on the terminal by which Emacs talks to the subprocess. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>kill-process</b><var> &amp;optional process current-group<a name="index-kill_002dprocess-3237"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function kills the process <var>process</var> by sending the
signal <code>SIGKILL</code>.  This signal kills the subprocess immediately,
and cannot be handled by the subprocess. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>quit-process</b><var> &amp;optional process current-group<a name="index-quit_002dprocess-3238"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sends the signal <code>SIGQUIT</code> to the process
<var>process</var>.  This signal is the one sent by the &ldquo;quit
character&rdquo; (usually <kbd>C-b</kbd> or <kbd>C-\</kbd>) when you are not inside
Emacs. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>stop-process</b><var> &amp;optional process current-group<a name="index-stop_002dprocess-3239"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function stops the process <var>process</var> by sending the
signal <code>SIGTSTP</code>.  Use <code>continue-process</code> to resume its
execution.

        <p>Outside of Emacs, on systems with job control, the &ldquo;stop character&rdquo;
(usually <kbd>C-z</kbd>) normally sends this signal.  When
<var>current-group</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, you can think of this function as
&ldquo;typing <kbd>C-z</kbd>&rdquo; on the terminal Emacs uses to communicate with the
subprocess. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>continue-process</b><var> &amp;optional process current-group<a name="index-continue_002dprocess-3240"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function resumes execution of the process <var>process</var> by sending
it the signal <code>SIGCONT</code>.  This presumes that <var>process</var> was
stopped previously. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>signal-process</b><var> process signal<a name="index-signal_002dprocess-3241"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sends a signal to process <var>process</var>.  The argument
<var>signal</var> specifies which signal to send; it should be an integer.

        <p>The <var>process</var> argument can be a system process <acronym>ID</acronym>; that
allows you to send signals to processes that are not children of
Emacs.  See <a href="System-Processes.html#System-Processes">System Processes</a>.
