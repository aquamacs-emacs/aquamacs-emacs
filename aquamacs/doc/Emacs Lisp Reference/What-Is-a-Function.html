<h3 class="section">12.1 What Is a Function?</h3>

<p>In a general sense, a function is a rule for carrying on a computation
given several values called <dfn>arguments</dfn>.  The result of the
computation is called the value of the function.  The computation can
also have side effects: lasting changes in the values of variables or
the contents of data structures.

   <p>Here are important terms for functions in Emacs Lisp and for other
function-like objects.

     <dl>
<dt><dfn>function</dfn><dd><a name="index-function-664"></a>In Emacs Lisp, a <dfn>function</dfn> is anything that can be applied to
arguments in a Lisp program.  In some cases, we use it more
specifically to mean a function written in Lisp.  Special forms and
macros are not functions.

     <br><dt><dfn>primitive</dfn><dd><a name="index-primitive-665"></a><a name="index-subr-666"></a><a name="index-built_002din-function-667"></a>A <dfn>primitive</dfn> is a function callable from Lisp that is written in C,
such as <code>car</code> or <code>append</code>.  These functions are also called
<dfn>built-in functions</dfn>, or <dfn>subrs</dfn>.  (Special forms are also
considered primitives.)

     <p>Usually the reason we implement a function as a primitive is either
because it is fundamental, because it provides a low-level interface
to operating system services, or because it needs to run fast. 
Primitives can be modified or added only by changing the C sources and
recompiling the editor.  See <a href="Writing-Emacs-Primitives.html#Writing-Emacs-Primitives">Writing Emacs Primitives</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>lambda expression</dfn><dd>A <dfn>lambda expression</dfn> is a function written in Lisp. 
These are described in the following section. 
See <a href="Lambda-Expressions.html#Lambda-Expressions">Lambda Expressions</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>special form</dfn><dd>A <dfn>special form</dfn> is a primitive that is like a function but does not
evaluate all of its arguments in the usual way.  It may evaluate only
some of the arguments, or may evaluate them in an unusual order, or
several times.  Many special forms are described in <a href="Control-Structures.html#Control-Structures">Control Structures</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>macro</dfn><dd><a name="index-macro-668"></a>A <dfn>macro</dfn> is a construct defined in Lisp by the programmer.  It
differs from a function in that it translates a Lisp expression that you
write into an equivalent expression to be evaluated instead of the
original expression.  Macros enable Lisp programmers to do the sorts of
things that special forms can do.  See <a href="Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>, for how to define and
use macros.

     <br><dt><dfn>command</dfn><dd><a name="index-command-669"></a>A <dfn>command</dfn> is an object that <code>command-execute</code> can invoke; it
is a possible definition for a key sequence.  Some functions are
commands; a function written in Lisp is a command if it contains an
interactive declaration (see <a href="Defining-Commands.html#Defining-Commands">Defining Commands</a>).  Such a function
can be called from Lisp expressions like other functions; in this case,
the fact that the function is a command makes no difference.

     <p>Keyboard macros (strings and vectors) are commands also, even though
they are not functions.  A symbol is a command if its function
definition is a command; such symbols can be invoked with <kbd>M-x</kbd>. 
The symbol is a function as well if the definition is a function. 
See <a href="Interactive-Call.html#Interactive-Call">Interactive Call</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>keystroke command</dfn><dd><a name="index-keystroke-command-670"></a>A <dfn>keystroke command</dfn> is a command that is bound to a key sequence
(typically one to three keystrokes).  The distinction is made here
merely to avoid confusion with the meaning of &ldquo;command&rdquo; in non-Emacs
editors; for Lisp programs, the distinction is normally unimportant.

     <br><dt><dfn>byte-code function</dfn><dd>A <dfn>byte-code function</dfn> is a function that has been compiled by the
byte compiler.  See <a href="Byte_002dCode-Type.html#Byte_002dCode-Type">Byte-Code Type</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>functionp</b><var> object<a name="index-functionp-671"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is any kind of
function, i.e. can be passed to <code>funcall</code>.  Note that
<code>functionp</code> returns <code>nil</code> for special forms (see <a href="Special-Forms.html#Special-Forms">Special Forms</a>). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Unlike <code>functionp</code>, the next three functions do <em>not</em>
treat a symbol as its function definition.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>subrp</b><var> object<a name="index-subrp-672"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a built-in function
(i.e., a Lisp primitive).

     <pre class="example">          (subrp 'message)            ; <code>message</code><span class="roman"> is a symbol,</span>
               &rArr; nil                 ;   <span class="roman">not a subr object.</span>
          (subrp (symbol-function 'message))
               &rArr; t
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>byte-code-function-p</b><var> object<a name="index-byte_002dcode_002dfunction_002dp-673"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a byte-code
function.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          (byte-code-function-p (symbol-function 'next-line))
               &rArr; t
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>subr-arity</b><var> subr<a name="index-subr_002darity-674"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function provides information about the argument list of a
primitive, <var>subr</var>.  The returned value is a pair
<code>(</code><var>min</var><code> . </code><var>max</var><code>)</code>.  <var>min</var> is the minimum number of
args.  <var>max</var> is the maximum number or the symbol <code>many</code>, for a
function with <code>&amp;rest</code> arguments, or the symbol <code>unevalled</code> if
<var>subr</var> is a special form. 
</p></blockquote></div>
