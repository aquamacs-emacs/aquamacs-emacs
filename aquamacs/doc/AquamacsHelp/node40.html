Changes-- 2.0preview3</A>
</H2>

<P>



<UL>
<LI><I>Aquamacs is now based on Emacs 23 and the Cocoa (NextStep) port.  There are many changes under the hood associated with this.  A few functions don't work right just yet, and we recommend neither this preview of Aquamacs 2.0 nor the Emacs 23.1 for mission-critical production use.  Please help the Aquamacs team complete the transition by contributing code and fixes or, if that's not possible, a donation.  Here, we report the changes between Emacs 22 and Emacs 23 with respect to the Aquamacs distribution.  Further changes can be found in the NEWS file for Emacs 23.</I>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs has a new icon in the Dock, designed by graphic designer Jessica Walker (jekawacaneer@gmail.com).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The Aquamacs application has been renamed to <I>Aquamacs.app</I> (from Aquamacs Emacs.app).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Spell-checking now uses the system-wide dictionaries in all the languages supported on OS X.  The standard spelling user interface is available as well as the traditional Emacs `ispell' interface (which also uses the system-wide spelling mechanism).  Configure the use of GNU `aspell' through the `ispell-program-name' variable if desired. 
Code by Nathaniel Cunningham.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Dialogs have been vastly improved: they appear as sheets over the frames where they belong, contain better UI elements (as in the case of the dialog displayed before quitting Aquamacs, which was once called ``dialog from hell'' before receiving a makeover).  The standard Enter, Space and Esc keys (and more) are supported.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Toolbars can now be configured through the normal customization panel.  Right-click on the toolbar, use the Options/View menu item (or use M-x ns-tool-bar-customize).  The chosen icons are persistent; toolbar customizations are, however, tied to the toolbars set by modes.  That means that users can chose a different set of icons to display in latex-mode, for instance.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The `ns-tool-bar-display-mode' variable now supports label-only toolbars.  Right-click on the toolbar to change; or use M-x customize or <TT>Preferences.el</TT> to set it to `labels' in order to only show labels.  The former meaning of this value (showing labels and icons) is now `both' (or, usually, nil, the default).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fonts and colors of all (mode-specific) faces can now be configured using the standard font and color panels.  The Options / Appearance menu provides a function to show the font panel, which leads to buttons for foreground and background colors.   We also have a menu item for the color panel separately, from where colors can be dragged&amp;dropped directly onto any piece of text to customize its face.  Holding down the Option key will, instead, set the face's background color. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The printing system has been revised; the standard print and page setup dialogs are used inside the application.  The print dialog now appears more quickly.  (Note: over-long lines will always be wrapped at word boundaries when printing. Clipping or horizontal pagination are not supported at this time.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When printing, double spaces are formatted as such and can be used to align text.
Reported by George Nurser.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>HTML and PDF export functions have changed: PDF export can be achieved as in any Mac application via the Print dialog.  Use the new <I>Copy as HTML</I> function in the <I>Edit</I> menu to copy formatted text including all the coloring into the clipboard in HTML format.  Many other applications, including presentation software, can then display the formatted text and keep it editable.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Keyboard bindings are displayed more consistently in the menus now.  Throughout Aquamacs,  Mac standard key descriptions are used (this may be configured using the variable `ns-use-mac-modifier-symbols').  Users should be aware that manuals and tutorials will often refer to keys such as <TT>C-x</TT> (<TT>X</TT> or Control X), and that keys like <TT>M-q</TT> correspond to the chosen Meta key modifier, normally the Option key. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fullscreen mode works largely as before in 10.6; in older versions of OS X, it will unconditionally take over the full screen (Dock and menu are not visible).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>`aquamacs-find-file' (C-x C-f) will ask for confirmation if you first complete partial filename input in the minibuffer, but then attempt to create a new file.
</LI>
<LI>Completion is, in many cases, more powerful by completing to the left <I>and</I> the right of the input string.  Customize the option `completion-styles' to control this.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Internally, Emacs is based on a superset of Unicode now.  Emacs also uses Cocoa, a modern technology that facilitates program development and maintenance, supports 64-bit computing on Macs and allows for better integration of applications with the operating system and other applications.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>As per Emacs 23, Aquamacs now supports multi-file commits in distributed version-control systems through the VC-dir package.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Soft wrapping is called `visual-line-mode' internally now, and the former Aquamacs mode of the same name is now a customization variable called `line-move-visual', which is enabled by default.  `Longlines-mode' is considered obsolete.   Users with manual customizations should adjust their settings.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>.wiki</TT> files now open in wikipedia-mode.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs uses ``Python-mode'' by default now for Python source files.  Users who prefer the original Emacs python package can switch by including <TT>(require 'python)</TT> in their <TT>Preferences.el</TT> file.
Code by Barry Warsaw.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Ruby mode has been revised to match and track the latest version included with GNU Emacs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Many more improvements between Emacs 22 and Emacs 23. See etc/NEWS at <TT><A NAME="tex2html34"
  HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.1">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.1</A></TT>.  NB, many of the items listed there do not apply to Mac OS X.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>DocView mode is no longer used to display PDF and other files (it didn't work well).
