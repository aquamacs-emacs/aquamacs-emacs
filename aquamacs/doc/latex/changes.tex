\paragraph{Authors:}
Aquamacs is based on GNU Emacs 22, a project led by Richard
M. Stallman, Stefan Monnier and Chong Yidong and developed with the
help of many others.  Aquamacs development, started in 2005, is led by
David Reitter, who is supported by a number of enthusiastic
developers, designers and users.

We try to attribute changes to the contributors to the best of our
ability. Externally maintained packages are often the work of many
others. Un-attributed changes in this change log were by David Reitter.

\subsection{Support}
Please refer to one of the many sources of information: There are
manuals describing Emacs, Emacs Lisp, and the differences in Aquamacs
available from the Help menu.  Consider reading the Emacs tutorial,
which is available in many languages (Help menu).  There is also a
link to the Aquamacs Wiki, which contains answers to frequently asked
questions, as well as configuration tips.  If these fail you, get in
touch with the Aquamacs community via the Emacs-on-OSX mailing list
(see \url{http://aquamacs.org/support.shtml}).
