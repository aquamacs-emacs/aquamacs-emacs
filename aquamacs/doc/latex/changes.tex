\paragraph{Authors:}
Aquamacs is based on GNU Emacs, a project led by Richard M. Stallman,
Stefan Monnier, and Chong Yidong and developed with the help of many
others.  Aquamacs development started in 2005 and was led by David
Reitter until 2019. Since 2019, continuing work on Aquamacs has been
led by Win Treese. Along the way, many enthusiastic developers,
designers, and users have contributed, and continue to contribute, to
the project.

We try to attribute changes to the contributors to the best of our
ability. Externally maintained packages are often the work of many
others. Unattributed changes in this change log were by David Reitter
(through release 3.5) and Win Treese (beginning with 3.6).

\subsection{Support}
Please refer to one of the many sources of information: There are
manuals describing Emacs, Emacs Lisp, and the differences in Aquamacs
available from the Help menu.  Consider reading the Emacs tutorial,
which is available in many languages (Help menu).  There is also a
link to the Aquamacs Wiki, which contains answers to frequently asked
questions, as well as configuration tips.  If these fail you, get in
touch with the Aquamacs community via the Emacs-on-OSX mailing list
(see \url{http://aquamacs.org/support.shtml}).
