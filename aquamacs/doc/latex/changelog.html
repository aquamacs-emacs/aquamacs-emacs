<UL>
<LI>Applied patch to correctly list colors on the Mac
</LI>
<LI>Build with libxml2 since it is bundled with Xcode
</LI>
<LI>Build is compatible back to 10.11 (El Capitan)
</LI>
<LI>(For developers) The build system is more configurable for some
  different development situations.
</LI>
<LI>Work around crash in Save As dialogs. Emacs main will later
  remove the problem code, so Aquamacs is temporarily patched to
  ignore the special code for handling keys in the dialog.
</LI>
<LI>Fixed issue #180: a crash when clicking on the menu bar.
</LI>
<LI>Fixed issue #185: Add Mac OS permission requests for various
  system operations, including AppleScript
</LI>
<LI>Fixed issue #195: Backported fix for Mach port leak from Emacs (bug 38618)
</LI>
<LI>Fixed issue #182: Aquamacs won't build on Catalina
</LI>
<LI>Fixed issue #194: cmd-meta-h hides non-emacs frames
</LI>
<LI>Fixed issue #178: Crash when deallocating image
</LI>
<LI>Fixed issue #166: Updated ELPA package GPG keyring
</LI>
<LI>Fixed issue #205: Updated gnutls configuration defaults
</LI>
<LI>Fixed issue #179: Change initialization so that bundled AUCTeX
  doesn't interfere with using an updated version from ELPA.
</LI>
<LI>Fixed issue #169: Update AUCTeX to current version 12.3, with
  Aquamacs patches
</LI>
<LI>Fixed issue #158: Don't offer to save *scratch* if there is no filename
</LI>
<LI>Reworked some of the NSapp memory management to avoid various crashes
</LI>
<LI>PR #208: (thanks to Michael Braun) Make
  display-mm-[height/width] return same values as Emacs-OSX. The
  effect of this is to make image display, especially LaTeX previews
  in AUCTeX and Org, look good on Retina displays.
</LI>
<LI>Updated the following external packages to their latest versions:
  
<UL>
<LI>filladapt
</LI>

The build process is able to sign releases and notarize them
  with Apple.
Added more automation to the process of building disk images for
  releases.
