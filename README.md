Aquamacs Emacs
===============================

This project is Aquamacs Emacs, a modified distribution of Emacs for Mac OS X.

Aquamacs tracks GNU Emacs, merging from the latest release branch.
Aquamacs is not a fork.

Aquamacs is designed to make it easy for users to get started with Emacs.
It also makes it easy to switch between different programs on the Mac.
Further, Aquamacs comes with many packages pre-installed and configured
so that users can, for example, start editing LaTeX documents with AUCTeX
or statistical programs in R using ESS-Mode.  Many programming languages
are supported, and sometimes Aquamacs provides, by default, other major
modes for certain programming languages than what comes with GNU Emacs.

Development on Aquamacs contributes back to GNU Emacs where appropriate.
